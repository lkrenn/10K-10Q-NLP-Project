# 10K-10Q-NLP-Project

Analyzing the quarterly 10K/10Q reports from companies. As the project stands right now, I will be more specifically looking at these reports from airlines domiciled in USA. I view the industry as a zero-sum game, which means that even the slightest sentimental difference between reports can be exploited.
