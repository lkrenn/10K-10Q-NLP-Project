Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements.4PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESSOverviewAmerican Airlines Group Inc. (AAG), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are American Airlines, Inc. (American), Envoy Aviation Group Inc. (Envoy), PSA Airlines, Inc. (PSA) and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (Piedmont). AAG was formed in 1982 under the name AMR Corporation (AMR) as the parent company of American, which was founded in 1934. AAG’s and American’s principal executive offices are located at 1 Skyview Drive, Fort Worth, Texas 76155 and their telephone number is 817-963-1234.Airline OperationsOur primary business activity is the operation of a major network carrier, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo.Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, our airline operates an average of 6,800 flights per day to more than 365 destinations in 61 countries through our hubs and gateways in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, London Heathrow, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In 2019, approximately 215 million passengers boarded our flights. During 2019, we launched new seasonal nonstop service to transatlantic markets Dubrovnik, Croatia and Berlin, Germany from Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). We also announced an international expansion beginning in summer 2020 that will, among other things, introduce new seasonal nonstop service between PHL and Casablanca, Morocco, representing our entry into the African market, new seasonal nonstop service between Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Krakow, Poland, Prague, Czech Republic and Budapest, Hungary, and the return of service to Tel Aviv, Israel, with year-round nonstop service from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Beginning in October 2020, we also plan to operate new seasonal nonstop service between Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Christchurch, New Zealand and from DFW to Auckland, New Zealand, to which we currently operate seasonal service from LAX. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 942 mainline aircraft supported by our regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers, which operated an additional 605 regional aircraft. See Part I, Item 2. Properties for further discussion on our mainline and regional aircraft and “Regional” below for further discussion on our regional operations.American is a founding member of the oneworld® alliance, whose members serve 1,100 destinations in 180 countries and territories. See below for further discussion on the oneworld alliance and other agreements with domestic and international airlines.See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –“2019 Financial Overview,” “AAG’s Results of Operations” and “American’s Results of Operations” for further discussion of AAG’s and American’s operating results and operating performance. Also, see Note 14 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 12 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding operating segments and see Note 1(k) to each of AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B, respectively, for passenger revenue by geographic region. RegionalOur regional carriers provide scheduled air transportation under the brand name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers include our wholly-owned regional carriers Envoy, PSA and Piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including Republic Airline Inc. (Republic), Mesa Airlines, Inc. (Mesa), SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Compass Airlines, LLC (Compass). Our regional carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on regional carriers to drive feeder traffic to our hubs from low-density markets that are not economical for us to serve with larger, mainline aircraft. In addition, regional carriers offer complementary service in many of our mainline markets. During 2019, approximately 59 million passengers boarded our regional carriers’ planes, approximately 43% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. All American Eagle carriers use logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to those of our mainline operations.5Substantially all of our regional carrier arrangements are in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and freight revenues, go to us. We control marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that we either reimburse or pay 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees, fuel and passenger liability insurance. CargoOur cargo division provides a wide range of freight and mail services, with facilities and interline connections available across the globe.Distribution and Marketing AgreementsPassengers can purchase tickets for travel on American through several distribution channels, including our website (www.aa.com), our mobile app, our reservations centers and third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents, travel management companies and online travel agents (e.g., Expedia, including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity, and Booking Holdings, including its booking sites Kayak and Priceline). To remain competitive, we will need to manage our distribution costs and rights effectively, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of our proprietary and third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.”In general, beyond nonstop city pairs, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to transport passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. In order to improve access to domestic and foreign markets, we have arrangements with other airlines including through the oneworld alliance, other cooperation agreements, joint business agreements (JBAs), and marketing relationships, as further discussed below.Member of oneworld AllianceAmerican is a founding member of the oneworld alliance, which currently includes British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LATAM Airlines Group, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines and SriLankan Airlines. The oneworld alliance links the networks of the member carriers and their respective affiliates to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers’ loyalty programs and access to the carriers’ airport lounge facilities. Royal Air Maroc is expected to join the oneworld alliance in 2020. LATAM Airlines Group (LATAM) is in the process of withdrawing from the oneworld alliance, which is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2020. Cooperation and Joint Business AgreementsAmerican has established a transatlantic JBA with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, a transpacific JBA with Japan Airlines and a JBA relating to Australia and New Zealand with Qantas Airways, each of which has been granted antitrust immunity. Joint business agreements enable the carriers party to the relevant agreement to cooperate on flights between particular destinations and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas. American and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into these JBAs and cooperation agreements. Joint business agreements have become a common approach among major carriers to address key regulatory restrictions typically applicable to international airline service, including limitations on the foreign ownership of airlines and national laws prohibiting foreign airlines from carrying passengers beyond specific gateway cities. Our competitors, including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, are party to similar arrangements.The business relationship under the transatlantic JBA benefits from a grant of antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and was reviewed by the European Commission (EC) in July 2010. In connection with this review, we provided certain commitments to the EC regarding, among other things, the availability of take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow (LHR) or London Gatwick (LGW) airports. The commitments accepted by the EC are binding for 10 years. In October 2018, in anticipation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit, and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation into the transatlantic JBA. We continue to fully cooperate with the CMA. An application for antitrust immunity is also pending with the DOT to add Aer Lingus, which is owned by the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, to the transatlantic JBA. 6As announced in September 2019, we are in the process of unwinding our commercial relationship with LATAM. We do not expect this change to have a significant financial impact on our company. After giving effect to this change, American remains the largest U.S. carrier to Latin America.Marketing RelationshipsTo improve access to each other’s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers, including American, have established marketing agreements with other airlines. These marketing agreements generally provide enhanced customer choice by means of an expanded network with reciprocal loyalty program participation and joint sales cooperation. As of December 31, 2019, American had codeshare and/or loyalty program relationships with Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cape Air, Cathay Dragon, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines, EL AL, Etihad Airways, Fiji Airways, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Interjet, Japan Airlines, Jetstar Group (includes Jetstar Airways and Jetstar Japan), Korean Air, LATAM (includes LATAM Airlines, LATAM Argentina, LATAM Brasil, LATAM Peru, LATAM Colombia and LATAM Ecuador), Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Seaborne Airlines, SriLankan Airlines and Vueling Airlines. In February 2020, American announced that it intends to enter into a codeshare relationship with the Brazilian airline, GOL Linhas Aéreas, which is expected to be implemented in 2020, subject to the receipt of relevant government approvals. Recent DevelopmentsOn February 13, 2020, we announced our intention to enter into an expanded relationship with Alaska Airlines. This arrangement, once finalized, will expand our existing codeshare relationship, including codeshare on certain of our international routes from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) and LAX, and will provide for reciprocal loyalty program benefits and shared lounge access. In addition, we announced new nonstop international service from SEA to Bangalore, India and to LHR, expected to commence in October 2020 and March 2021, respectively. The implementation of this expanded relationship and commencement of these new routes are subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation and governmental review.Loyalty ProgramOur loyalty program, AAdvantage®, was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage. AAdvantage was named Best Elite Program in the Americas for the eighth consecutive year in that category at the 2019 Freddie Awards, which are annual awards that recognize the world’s most outstanding frequent travel programs. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of over 1,000 program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies. For every dollar spent, non-status members earn five mileage credits, but Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro and Executive Platinum status holders earn bonus mileage credits of seven, eight, nine and eleven mileage credits, respectively.All travel on eligible tickets counts toward qualification for elite status in the AAdvantage program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded travel on American and participating airlines, membership to our Admirals Club® or for other non-travel awards from our program participants. Most travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. A member’s mileage credit does not expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 18 months. Elite members can enjoy additional benefits of the AAdvantage program, including complimentary upgrades, checked bags, and Preferred and Main Cabin Extra seats, as well as priority check-in, security, boarding and baggage delivery. Additionally, our members earn bonus mileage credits when elite status is obtained. Under our agreements with AAdvantage members and program partners, we reserve the right to change the terms of the AAdvantage program at any time and without notice, and may end the program with six months’ notice. Program rules, partners, special offers, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change.During 2019, our members redeemed approximately 14 million awards, including travel redemptions for flights and upgrades on American and other air carriers, as well as redemption of car and hotel awards, club memberships and merchandise. Approximately 8% of our 2019 total revenue passenger miles flown were from award travel.See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for more information on our loyalty program.7Industry CompetitionDomesticThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. On most of our domestic nonstop routes, we currently face competing service from other domestic airlines, including major network airlines, low-cost carriers and ultra-low-cost carriers such as Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition, we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines operating point-to-point service on such routes. We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation.On all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other airlines. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, targeted promotions and loyalty program initiatives. Airlines typically use discounted fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slack travel periods, when they begin service to new cities or when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow, to maximize revenue per available seat mile and to establish, increase or preserve market share. Most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market, and we have often elected to match discounted or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. In addition, low-fare, low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, and so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, compete in many of the markets in which we operate and competition from these carriers is increasing.In addition to price competition, airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle regional carriers increase the number of markets we serve by flying to lower demand markets and providing connections at our hubs. Many of our competitors also own or have agreements with regional airlines that provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times), availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to passengers, loyalty programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products and other services. InternationalIn addition to our extensive domestic service, we provide international service to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Asia, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and in 2020, will expand our international service to include Israel as well as Morocco, our first African destination. In providing international air transportation, we compete with other U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines. Competition is increasing from foreign state-owned and state-affiliated airlines in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft in service and on order and are increasing service to the U.S. from locations both in and outside the Middle East. Service to and from locations outside of the Middle East is provided by some of these carriers under so-called “fifth freedom” rights permitted under international treaties which allow service to and from stopover points between an airline’s home country and the ultimate destination. Such flights, such as a stopover in Europe on flights to the United States, allow the carrier to sell tickets for travel between the stopover point and the United States in competition with service provided by us. We believe these state-owned and state-affiliated carriers in the Gulf region, including their affiliated carriers, benefit from significant government subsidies, which have allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence. Competition is also increasing from low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies.In order to increase our ability to compete for international air transportation service, which is subject to extensive government regulation, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into bilateral and multilateral marketing relationships, alliances, cooperation agreements and JBAs to exchange traffic among each other’s flights and route networks. See “Distribution and Marketing Agreements” above for further discussion.8Employees and Labor RelationsThe airline business is labor intensive. In 2019, salaries, wages and benefits were our largest expense and represented 34% of our total operating expenses. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 133,700 active full-time equivalent employees, approximately 85% of whom were represented by various labor unions responsible for negotiating the collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) covering them.Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and CBAs. When an RLA CBA becomes amendable, if either party to the agreement wishes to modify its terms, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed under the RLA and as agreed by the parties. Under the RLA, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day “cooling off” period. At the end of this “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a strike, and the airline may resort to its own “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments to the CBA and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted slowdowns or refusals to work, such as strikes, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance.The following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions:Union Class or Craft Employees (1) ContractAmendable DateMainline: Allied Pilots Association (APA) Pilots 13,800 2020Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) Flight Attendants 25,300 2019Airline Customer Service Employee Association – Communications Workers of America and International Brotherhood of Teamsters (CWA-IBT) Passenger Service 14,050 2020Transport Workers Union and International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (TWU-IAM Association) Mechanics and Related 12,650 2018TWU-IAM Association Fleet Service 17,750 2018TWU-IAM Association Stock Clerks 1,850 2018TWU-IAM Association Flight Simulator Engineers 150 2021TWU-IAM Association Maintenance Control Technicians 200 2018TWU-IAM Association Maintenance Training Instructors 30 2018Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA) Dispatchers 500 2021Transport Workers Union (TWU) Flight Crew Training Instructors 350 2021Envoy: Air Line Pilots Associations (ALPA) Pilots 2,250 2024Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) Flight Attendants 1,650 2020TWU Ground School Instructors 10 2023TWU Mechanics and Related 1,400 20209Union Class or Craft Employees (1) ContractAmendable DateTWU Stock Clerks 150 2020TWU Fleet Service Clerks 4,050 2019TWU Dispatchers 70 2025Communications Workers of America (CWA) Passenger Service 6,300 2026Piedmont: ALPA Pilots 550 2024AFA Flight Attendants 350 2019International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Mechanics 450 2021IBT Stock Clerks 60 2021CWA Fleet and Passenger Service 6,550 2023IBT Dispatchers 30 2019ALPA Flight Crew Training Instructors 40 2024PSA: ALPA Pilots 1,950 2023AFA Flight Attendants 1,450 2023International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (IAM) Mechanics 700 2022TWU Dispatchers 60 2022 (1) Approximate number of active employees represented as of December 31, 2019.Joint collective bargaining agreements (JCBAs) have been reached with post-Merger employee groups, except for contracts with the TWU-IAM Association which represents the mechanics and related, fleet service, stock clerks, maintenance control technicians and maintenance training instructors whose contracts became amendable in the third quarter of 2018. Agreements in principle were reached with the TWU-IAM Association on January 30, 2020 for JCBAs covering all of these workgroups. Those agreements are subject to membership ratification vote. Additionally, the post-Merger JCBAs covering our pilots and flight attendants became amendable in January 2020 and December 2019, respectively. Negotiations continue for new agreements.Among our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries, the Envoy fleet service clerks, Piedmont flight attendants and Piedmont dispatchers have agreements that are now amendable and are engaged in traditional RLA negotiations. Envoy is also in negotiations with the union representing its flight attendants, whose contract becomes amendable in 2020.For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.”Aircraft FuelOur operations and financial results are significantly affected by the availability and price of aircraft fuel, which in 2019 was our second largest expense. Based on our 2020 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the price of aircraft fuel would increase our 2020 annual fuel expense by $47 million.The following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs, including taxes, for our mainline and regional operations for 2019 and 2018 (gallons and aircraft fuel expense in millions).YearGallons Average Priceper Gallon Aircraft FuelExpense Percent of TotalOperating Expenses20194,537 $2.07 $9,395 22.0%20184,447 2.23 9,896 23.6%10As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.Aircraft fuel prices have in the past, and may in the future, experience substantial volatility. We cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters (including hurricanes or similar events in the U.S. Southeast and on the Gulf Coast where a significant portion of domestic refining capacity is located), political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in the cost to transport or store petroleum products, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity or competing demand for fuel from other transport industries, such as maritime shipping, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, distribution challenges, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.”Seasonality and Other FactorsDue to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. General economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Therefore, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.Domestic and Global Regulatory LandscapeGeneralAirlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Domestically, the DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.The DOT, among other things, oversees and regulates domestic and international codeshare agreements, international route authorities, competition and consumer protection matters such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), along with the DOT in certain instances, have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.The FAA similarly exercises safety oversight and regulates most operational matters of our business, including how we operate and maintain our aircraft. FAA requirements cover, among other things, required technology and necessary onboard equipment; systems, procedures and training necessary to ensure the continuous airworthiness of our fleet of aircraft; safety measures and equipment; crew scheduling limitations and experience requirements; and many other technical aspects of airline operations. Additionally, our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements. The FAA also controls the national airspace system, including operational rules and fees for air traffic control (ATC) services. The efficiency, reliability and capacity of the ATC network has a significant impact on our costs and on the timeliness of our operations.The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.Airport Access and OperationsDomestically, any U.S. airline authorized by the DOT is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its territories, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations (slots) and other facilities, and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. Operations at three major domestic airports we serve (John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and La Guardia Airport (LGA) in New York City, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Washington, D.C.) and many foreign airports we serve (including LHR) are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. 11Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In addition to slot restrictions, operations at LGA and DCA are also limited based on a so-called “perimeter rule” which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1,500 and 1,250 miles, respectively.Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as ORD and LAX where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.Existing law also permits domestic local airport authorities to implement procedures and impose restrictions designed to abate noise, provided such procedures and restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs.Airline Fares, Taxes and User FeesAirlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but only applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve.Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on domestic and international air transportation, and to collect other taxes and charge other fees, such as foreign taxes, security fees and passenger facility charges. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. These taxes and fees are subject to increase from time to time.DOT Passenger Protection RulesThe DOT regulates airline interactions with passengers through the ticketing process, at the airport and on board the aircraft. Among other things, these regulations govern how our fares are displayed online, required customer disclosures, access by disabled passengers, handling of long onboard flight delays and reporting of mishandled bags. In 2020, the DOT is expected to implement a number of new regulations that will impact us, including disability rules for accessible lavatories and refunds for checked bag fees in the event of certain delays in delivery.InternationalInternational air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation, including aviation agreements between the U.S. and other countries or governmental authorities, such as the EU. Moreover, our alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies agreements.In addition, foreign countries impose passenger protection rules, which are analogous to, and often meet or exceed the requirements of, the DOT passenger protection rules discussed above. In cases where these foreign requirements exceed the DOT rules, we may bear additional burdens and liabilities. Further, various foreign airport authorities impose noise restrictions at their local airports.SecuritySince shortly after the events of September 11, 2001, substantially all aspects of civil aviation security in the U.S. or affecting U.S. carriers have been controlled or regulated by the federal government through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Requirements include flight deck security; carriage of federal air marshals at no charge; enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors; fingerprint-based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports; and the provision of certain passenger data to the federal government and other international border security authorities, for security and immigration controls. Funding for the TSA is provided by a combination of air carrier fees, passenger fees and taxpayer funds. Customs and Border Protection, which, like the TSA, is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), also promulgates requirements, performs services and collects fees that impact our provision of services. Additionally, we have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. Our international service further requires us to comply with the civil aviation security regimes imposed at the foreign airports we serve. 12Environmental MattersEnvironmental RegulationThe airline industry is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund Act). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.Revised underground storage tank regulations issued by the EPA in 2015 have affected certain airport fuel hydrant systems, with modifications of such systems needed in order to comply with applicable portions of the revised regulations. In addition, related to the EPA and state regulations pertaining to storm water management, several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of deicing fluid into the environment, often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport deicing facilities.The environmental laws to which we are subject include those related to responsibility for potential soil and groundwater contamination. We are conducting investigation and remediation activities to address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and maintenance bases. We presently anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. Our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of all PRPs. Accordingly, we presently anticipate that any future payments of costs at such sites will not have a material impact on our operations.We employ an environmental management system that provides a systematic approach for compliance with environmental regulations and management of a broad range of issues including air emissions, hazardous waste disposal, underground tanks, and aircraft water quality. Aircraft Emissions and Climate Change RequirementsMany aspects of our operations are subject to a number of increasingly stringent environmental regulations and concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In particular, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is in the process of adopting rules that will require us to limit the CO2 emissions of a significant majority of our international flights to a baseline level equal to our 2019-2020 average emissions from such flights. In 2016, ICAO passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), an international, market-based emissions offset program intended to achieve carbon-neutral growth in the international aviation sector after 2020. CORSIA is expected to be implemented in three phases: the Pilot Phase (from 2021 to 2023); the First Phase (from 2024 to 2027); and the Second Phase (from 2027 to 2035). American and the majority of other U.S. airlines currently report their CO2 emissions to the FAA in accordance with CORSIA requirements. It is expected that the FAA (with the support of Congress) will implement regulations to establish a carbon offset credit surrender mechanism and to provide for the oversight and compliance auditing of the CORSIA obligations of U.S. carriers, including American.To meet their obligations under CORSIA, airlines will have the option to increase the efficiency of their fleet, use sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel, or purchase carbon offset credits. At this time, the costs of complying with our future obligations under CORSIA are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. For example, we will not directly control our CORSIA compliance costs during the CORSIA Pilot and First Phases because such phases include a sharing mechanism for the growth in emissions for the global aviation sector. In addition, and with respect to all phases of CORSIA including after 2027, there is uncertainty with respect to the future supply, demand and price of sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel, carbon offset credits and technologies that could allow airlines to reduce their emissions of CO2.13In the event that CORSIA does not come into force as expected, American and other airlines could become subject to an unpredictable and inconsistent array of national or regional emissions restrictions, creating a patchwork of complex regulatory requirements that will often affect global competitors differently and frequently offer no meaningful aviation environmental improvements. For example, a directive adopted in 2008 by the EU currently covers CO2 emissions from flights operating within the mostly European countries participating in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The EU ETS does not apply to CO2 emissions from the vast majority of American flights serving EU countries because, in 2012, the EU agreed to suspend the application of its rules to international flights to pursue, instead, a global effort solely through ICAO. The EU has extended the suspension of its rules to international flights through the end of 2023, contingent on the successful implementation of CORSIA. We have taken a number of actions that mitigate our GHG emissions and conserve fuel such as:•retiring older, less fuel-efficient aircraft and replacing them with new, more fuel-efficient aircraft, resulting in the youngest mainline fleet of any U.S. network carrier;•reducing fuel consumption through operational initiatives such as single-engine taxi and engine washing;•working with the FAA and vendors to facilitate efficient airspace procedures, which also reduces aircraft emissions;•updating our fleet with lightweight interiors including seats and furnishings and replacing existing cargo containers with lighter weight versions; •replacing older, inefficient ground support equipment with new, more fuel-efficient ground support equipment, including alternative-fuel and electric powered equipment;•purchasing renewable electricity to reduce indirect emissions associated with the production of the power we consume;•seeking certification of certain of our buildings to the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard;•entering into discussions with potential vendors to explore potential production pathways for sustainable alternative aircraft fuel; and•collaborating with airports and other stakeholders to accelerate the introduction of sustainable or lower carbon fuels.For further information, see our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, available on our website at www.aa.com/CRR.

See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Evolving data security and privacy requirements could increase our costs, and any significant data security incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition,” “If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations,” “Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages,” “The airline industry is heavily taxed,” “We are subject to many forms of environmental and noise regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result,” and “We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure” for additional information.14Available InformationUse of Websites to Disclose InformationOur website is located at www.aa.com.

RISK FACTORSBelow are certain risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business.The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.Our competitors include other major domestic airlines and foreign, regional and new entrant airlines, as well as joint ventures formed by some of these airlines, many of which have more financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than ours, as well as other forms of transportation, including rail and private automobiles. In many of our markets we compete with at least one low-cost carrier (including so-called ultra-low cost carriers). Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity, amenities, loyalty benefits and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. These factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses, as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may institute pricing structures intended to achieve near-term survival rather than long-term viability.Low-cost carriers (including so-called ultra-low-cost carriers) have a profound impact on industry revenues. Using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from larger, more established airlines, and represent significant competitors, particularly for customers who fly infrequently, are price sensitive and therefore tend not to be loyal to any one particular carrier. A number of these low-cost carriers have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of new aircraft for delivery in the next few years. These low-cost carriers are attempting to continue to increase their market share through growth and, potentially, consolidation, and are expected to continue to have an impact on our revenues and overall performance. We and several other large network carriers have implemented “Basic Economy” fares designed to more effectively compete against low-cost carriers, but we cannot predict whether these initiatives will be successful. While historically these carriers have provided competition in domestic markets, we have recently experienced new competition from low-cost carriers on international routes, including low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies. The actions of existing or future low-cost carriers, including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.We provide air travel internationally, directly as well as through joint business, alliance, codeshare and similar arrangements to which we are a party. While our network is comprehensive, compared to some of our key global competitors, we generally have somewhat greater relative exposure to certain regions (for example, Latin America) and somewhat lower relative exposures to others (for example, China). Our financial performance relative to our key competitors will therefore be influenced significantly by macro-economic conditions in particular regions around the world and the relative exposure of our network to the markets in those regions. In providing international air transportation, we compete to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations with U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines. Competition is increasing from foreign state-owned and state-affiliated airlines in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft in service and on order and are increasing service to the U.S. from locations both in and outside the Middle East. Service to and from locations outside of the Middle East is provided by some of these carriers under so-called “fifth freedom” rights permitted under international treaties which allow service to and from stopover points between an airline’s home country and the ultimate destination. Such flights, such as a stopover in Europe on flights to the United States, allow the carrier to sell tickets for travel between the stopover point and the United States in competition with service provided by us. We believe these state-owned and state-affiliated carriers in the Gulf region, including their affiliated carriers, benefit from significant government subsidies, which have allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence.Our international service exposes us to foreign economies and the potential for reduced demand when any foreign country we serve suffers adverse local economic conditions. In addition, open skies agreements, which are now in place with a substantial number of countries around the world, provide international airlines with open access to U.S. markets, potentially subjecting us to increased competition on our international routes. See also “Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.”16Certain airline alliances, joint ventures and joint businesses have been, or may in the future be, granted immunity from antitrust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to effectively compete may be hindered. Our ability to attract and retain customers is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to offer our customers convenient access to desired markets. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or obtain alliance and marketing relationships with other air carriers in desired markets.American has established a transatlantic JBA with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, a transpacific JBA with Japan Airlines and a JBA relating to Australia and New Zealand with Qantas Airways, each of which has been granted antitrust immunity. The transatlantic JBA relationship benefits from a grant of antitrust immunity from the DOT and was reviewed by the EC in July 2010. In connection with this review, we provided certain commitments to the EC regarding, among other things, the availability of take-off and landing slots at LHR or LGW airports. The commitments accepted by the EC are binding for 10 years. In October 2018, in anticipation of Brexit and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020, the CMA opened an investigation into the transatlantic JBA. We continue to fully cooperate with the CMA. An application for antitrust immunity is also pending with the DOT to add Aer Lingus, which is owned by the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, to the transatlantic JBA. The foregoing arrangements are important aspects of our international network and we are dependent on the performance and continued cooperation of the other airlines party to those agreements. No assurances can be given as to any benefits that we may derive from such arrangements or any other arrangements that may ultimately be implemented, or whether or not regulators will, or if granted continue to, approve or impose material conditions on our business activities.Additional mergers and other forms of industry consolidation, including antitrust immunity grants, may take place and may not involve us as a participant. Depending on which carriers combine and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other carriers in connection with any such combinations, our competitive position relative to the post-combination carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. In addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or antitrust immunity grants, their route networks will grow, and that growth will result in greater overlap with our network, which in turn could decrease our overall market share and revenues. Such consolidation is not limited to the U.S., but could include further consolidation among international carriers in Europe and elsewhere.Additionally, our AAdvantage loyalty program, which is an important element of our sales and marketing programs, faces significant and increasing competition from the loyalty programs offered by other travel companies, as well as from similar loyalty benefits offered by banks and other financial services companies. Competition among loyalty programs is intense regarding the rewards, fees, required usage, and other terms and conditions of these programs. These competitive factors affect our ability to attract and retain customers, increase usage of our loyalty program and maximize the revenue generated by our loyalty program.Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our business. See also “The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.” Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:•actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks and political instability;•changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends;•changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations, and other factors;17•actual or potential disruptions to the ATC systems;•increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental measures;•outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and•weather and natural disasters, including increases in frequency, severity or duration of such disasters, and related costs caused by more severe weather due to climate change.In particular, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus, coronavirus or any other similar illness, if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel behavior. For example, the coronavirus outbreak that originated in or around Wuhan, China in January 2020 has resulted in the widespread suspension of commercial air service to the region, including by American, as well as the imposition by the U.S. and other governments of significant restrictions on inbound travel from this region. Our suspension of service, which remains in place as of the date of this report, and the potential for a period of significantly reduced demand for travel has and will likely continue to result in significant lost revenue. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Market prices for aircraft fuel have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continue to be highly volatile.Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of fuel can have a material effect on our operating results and liquidity. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market for air travel, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares, impose fuel surcharges or otherwise increase revenues or decrease other operating costs sufficiently to offset fuel price increases. Similarly, we cannot predict actions that may be taken by our competitors in response to changes in fuel prices.Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, we cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters (including hurricanes or similar events in the U.S. Southeast and on the Gulf Coast where a significant portion of domestic refining capacity is located), political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in the cost to transport or store petroleum products, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, distribution challenges, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. For instance, effective January 1, 2020, rules adopted by the International Maritime Organization restrict the sulfur content allowable in marine fuels from 3.5% to 0.5%, which is expected to cause increased demand by maritime shipping companies for low-sulfur fuel and potentially lead to increased costs of aircraft fuel. Any of these factors or events could cause a disruption in or increased demands on oil production, refinery operations, pipeline capacity or terminal access and possibly result in significant increases in the price of aircraft fuel and diminished availability of aircraft fuel supply.Our aviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide meaningful price protection against increases in fuel costs. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review this policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. See also the discussion in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – “Aircraft Fuel.”18Our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases related to airport and other facilities, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a substantial portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, which are generally greater than the indebtedness and other obligations of our competitors, could have important consequences. For example, they:•may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness;•may limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, integration costs and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;•make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events, particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage;•significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines;•limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;•contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities; and•contain restrictive covenants that could, among other things:◦limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends; and◦if breached, result in an event of default under our indebtedness.These obligations could also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Further, a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for deposits of U.S. dollars. LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. To the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, or what effect these changes in views or alternatives may have on financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities, we cannot currently predict whether this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment 19of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – “Interest.”We may in the future pursue amendments to our LIBOR-based debt transactions to provide for a transaction mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments. As of December 31, 2019, we had $9.6 billion of borrowings based on LIBOR. The replacement of LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.Our business plan contemplates continued significant investments related to modernizing our fleet, improving the experience of our customers and updating our facilities. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of December 31, 2019, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2020-2024 would be approximately $8.1 billion. We may also require financing to refinance maturing obligations and to provide liquidity to fund other corporate requirements. Accordingly, we will need substantial financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft and engines and meet such other liquidity needs. If we are unable to arrange such financing at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase such aircraft and engines or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft and engines with the applicable aircraft and engine manufacturers or otherwise defer corporate obligations. Depending on numerous factors applicable at the time we seek capital, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain “amendable dates” rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see Part I, Item 1. Business – “Employees and Labor Relations.”In the case of a CBA that is amendable under the RLA, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During or after that period, a PEB may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day “cooling off” period. At the end of this “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a strike, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted slowdowns or refusals to work, such as strikes, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. For example, last year we initiated litigation and obtained a permanent injunction after the unions representing our mechanics and other ground workers 20engaged in an unlawful work action which adversely affected our operation. Additionally, some of our unions have brought and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration, including those related to wages. If successful, there is a risk these arbitral avenues could result in material additional costs that we did not anticipate. See also Part I, Item 1. Business – “Employees and Labor Relations.”As of December 31, 2019, approximately 85% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions. Currently, we believe our labor costs are competitive relative to the other large network carriers. However, we cannot provide assurance that labor costs going forward will remain competitive because we are in negotiations for several important new labor agreements now and other agreements are scheduled to become amendable, competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs or we may agree to higher-cost provisions unilaterally or in connection with our current or future labor negotiations.We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our pension funding obligations are significant. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. The minimum funding obligation applicable to our pension plans was subject to favorable temporary funding rules that expired at the end of 2017 and, as a result, our minimum pension funding obligations increased materially beginning in 2019. In addition, we have significant obligations for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Additionally, we participate in the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (IAM) National Pension Fund (the IAM Pension Fund). The funding status of the IAM Pension Fund is subject to the risk that other employers may not meet their obligations, which under certain circumstances could cause our obligations to increase. Furthermore, if we were to withdraw from the IAM Pension Fund, if the IAM Pension fund were to terminate, or if the IAM Pension Fund were to undergo a mass withdrawal, we could be subject to liability as imposed by law. Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results. Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to our business. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by, among other things, any failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental sustainability practices for all of our operations and activities, our impact on the environment, public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies, such as movements to institute a “living wage,” customer perceptions of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs, customer perceptions of our use of social media, or customer perceptions of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents or other third parties. Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of customer confidence in our services could adversely affect our business and financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any public incident involving our company, our people or our brand, including any accident or other public incident involving our personnel or aircraft, or the personnel or aircraft of our regional, codeshare or joint business operators.In a modern world where news can be captured and travel rapidly, we are at risk of adverse publicity stemming from any public incident involving our company, our people or our brand. Such an incident could involve the actual or alleged behavior of any of our more than 133,000 employees. Further, if our personnel, one of our aircraft, a type of aircraft in our fleet, or personnel of, or an aircraft that is operated under our brand by, one of our regional operators or an airline with which we have a marketing alliance, joint business or codeshare relationship, were to be involved in a public incident, accident, catastrophe or regulatory enforcement action, we could be exposed to significant reputational harm and potential legal liability. The insurance we carry may be inapplicable or inadequate to cover any such incident, accident, catastrophe or action. In the event that our insurance is inapplicable or inadequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an incident or accident. In addition, any such incident, accident, catastrophe or action involving our personnel, one of our aircraft (or personnel and aircraft of our regional operators and our codeshare partners), or a type of aircraft fleet could create an adverse public perception, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners, and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.21Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the DOT, the FAA, the TSA and the DHS have issued regulations and a number of other directives, that affect the airline industry. These requirements impose substantial costs on us and restrict the ways we may conduct our business.For example, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. These requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise impact our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft, and in some instances have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft types altogether (including the March 2019 grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, including the 24 aircraft in our fleet, which remains in place as of the date of this report), or otherwise caused substantial disruption and resulted in material costs to us and lost revenues. The FAA also exercises comprehensive regulatory authority over nearly all technical aspects of our operations. Our failure to comply with such requirements has in the past and may in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. In the future, any new regulatory requirements, particularly requirements that limit our ability to operate or price our products, could have a material adverse effect on us and the industry.DOT consumer rules dictate procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, further regulate airline interactions with passengers, including passengers with disabilities, through the ticketing process, at the airport, and onboard the aircraft, and require disclosures concerning airline fares and ancillary fees such as baggage fees. Other DOT rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international airlines. In 2020, the DOT is expected to implement a number of new regulations that will impact us, including disability rules for accessible lavatories and refunds for checked bag fees in the event of certain delays in delivery. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per-ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. Present and potential future security requirements can have the effect of imposing costs and inconvenience on travelers, potentially reducing the demand for air travel.The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct business each may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including:•changes in law that affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports, or the types of fares offered or fees that can be charged to passengers;•the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including antitrust or foreign government approvals) needed for codesharing alliances, joint businesses and other arrangements with other airlines;•restrictions on competitive practices (for example, court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an airline’s ability to respond to a competitor);•the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations that impact customer service standards;•restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of slots at airports or the auction or reallocation of slot rights currently held by us; and•the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions.Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to airline operations and, in some cases, may reduce the demand for air travel. There can be no assurance that the increased costs or greater complexity associated with our compliance with new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us.Any significant reduction in air traffic capacity at and in the airspace serving key airports in the U.S. or overseas could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the United States National Airspace System (the ATC system) is not successfully modernizing to meet the growing demand for U.S. air travel. Air traffic controllers rely on outdated procedures and technologies that routinely compel airlines to fly inefficient routes or take significant delays on the ground. The ATC system’s inability to manage existing travel demand has led government agencies to implement short-term capacity constraints during peak travel periods or adverse weather 22conditions in certain markets, resulting in delays and disruptions of air traffic. The outdated technologies also cause the ATC system to be less resilient in the event of a failure. For example, an automation failure and an evacuation, in 2015 and 2017 respectively, at the Washington Air Route Control Center resulted in cancellations and delays of hundreds of flights traversing the greater Washington, D.C. airspace.In the early 2000s, the FAA embarked on a path to modernize the national airspace system, including migration from the current radar-based ATC system to a GPS-based system. This modernization of the ATC system, generally referred to as “NextGen,” has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and it remains uncertain when the full array of benefits expected from this modernization will be available to the public and the airlines. Failure to update the ATC system in a timely manner and the substantial costs that may be imposed on airlines in order to fund a modernized ATC system may have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, our business has been adversely impacted when government agencies have ceased to operate as expected including due to partial shut-downs, sequestrations or similar events. These events have resulted in, among other things, reduced demand for air travel, an actual or perceived reduction in ATC and security screening resources and related travel delays, as well as disruption in the ability of the FAA to grant required regulatory approvals, such as those that are involved when a new aircraft is first placed into service. Our operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or governmental authorities, such as the EU, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which agreements allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies agreements. For example, the open skies air services agreement between the U.S. and the EU, which took effect in March 2008, provides airlines from the U.S. and EU member states open access to each other’s markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly from the U.S. to any airport in the EU. As a result of the agreement and a subsequent open skies agreement involving the U.S. and the United Kingdom, which was agreed in anticipation of Brexit, we face increased competition in these markets, including LHR. Bilateral and multilateral agreements among the U.S. and various foreign governments of countries we serve but which are not covered by an open skies treaty are subject to periodic renegotiation. We currently operate a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of airlines permitted to operate on the route, the capacity of the airlines providing services on the route, or the number of airlines allowed access to particular airports. If an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these markets, it could have a material adverse impact on us and could result in the impairment of material amounts of our related tangible and intangible assets. In addition, competition from foreign airlines, revenue-sharing joint ventures, JBAs, and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of our business and assets on the open skies routes. Brexit occurred on January 31, 2020 under the terms of the agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (the Withdrawal Agreement). There will now be a transition period during which the United Kingdom and the EU will seek to negotiate an agreement governing their future relationship, including in relation to air services. Under the Withdrawal Agreement, this transition period is scheduled to end on December 31, 2020, with a potential extension of up to two years, although the United Kingdom government has passed legislation preventing any such extension of the transition period. We face risks associated with Brexit, notably given the extent of our passenger and cargo traffic and that of our joint business partners that flows through LHR in the United Kingdom. During the transition period, our current air services may continue as we currently conduct them. However, Brexit will mandate further modification in the current regulatory regime, including in relation to commercial air service. The precise scope of traffic rights between the EU and the United Kingdom remains uncertain and therefore the continuation of our current services is not assured and could be subject to disruption. During the transition period, the United Kingdom and the EU will seek to implement a new air services agreement. We cannot predict the terms of any such successor air services agreement or whether changes in the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU, including whether or not an agreement governing their future relationship is reached before the end of the transition period, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. More generally, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, slots or other assets located abroad, or otherwise adversely affect our international operations.23We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.We operate a global business with significant operations outside of the U.S. Our current international activities and prospects have been and in the future could be adversely affected by government policies, reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, increased competition in international markets, the performance of our alliance, joint business and codeshare partners in a given market, exchange controls or other restrictions on repatriation of funds, currency and political risks (including changes in exchange rates and currency devaluations), environmental regulation, increases in taxes and fees and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots. Fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, exchange controls and other restrictions on the repatriation of funds, have significantly affected and may continue to significantly affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the U.S. in local currency. Such fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.More generally, our industry may be affected by any deterioration in global trade relations, including shifts in the trade policies of individual nations. For example, much of the demand for international air travel is the result of business travel in support of global trade. Should protectionist governmental policies, such as increased tariff or other trade barriers, travel limitations and other regulatory actions, have the effect of reducing global commercial activity, the result could be a material decrease in the demand for international air travel. Additionally, certain of the products and services that we purchase, including certain of our aircraft and related parts, are sourced from suppliers located in foreign countries, and the imposition of new tariffs, or any increase in existing tariffs, by the U.S. government in respect of the importation of such products could materially increase the amounts we pay for them. In particular, on October 2, 2019, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), as part of an ongoing dispute with the EU before the World Trade Organization (WTO) concerning, among other things, aircraft subsidies, was authorized by an arbitration tribunal of the WTO to impose up to $7.5 billion per year in import tariffs on certain goods originating from the EU. In October 2019, the USTR imposed tariffs on certain imports from the EU, including certain Airbus aircraft that we previously contracted to purchase, which were initially subject to an ad valorem duty of 10%. On February 14, 2020, the USTR increased such duty to 15% effective March 18, 2020. While the scope and rate of these tariffs are subject to change, if and to the extent these tariffs are imposed on us without any available means for us to mitigate or pass on the burden of these tariffs to Airbus, the effective cost of new Airbus aircraft required to implement our fleet plan would increase.Brexit occurred on January 31, 2020 under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. There will now be a transition period during which the United Kingdom and the EU will seek to negotiate an agreement governing their future relationship, including in relation to air services. Under the Withdrawal Agreement, this transition period is scheduled to end on December 31, 2020, with a potential extension of up to two years, although the United Kingdom government has passed legislation preventing any such extension of the transition period. We face risks associated with Brexit, notably given the extent of our passenger and cargo traffic and that of our joint business partners that flows through LHR in the United Kingdom. During the transition period, our current air services may continue as we currently conduct them. The precise scope of traffic rights between the EU and the United Kingdom remains uncertain and therefore the continuation is not assured and could be subject to disruption. During the transition period, the United Kingdom and the EU will seek to implement a new air services agreement. We cannot predict the terms of any such successor air services agreement or whether changes in the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU, including whether or not an agreement governing their future relationship is reached before the end of the transition period, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Moreover, Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to further instability in global financial markets. In addition, Brexit has created uncertainty as to the future trade relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom, including air traffic services. LHR is presently a very important element of our international network, however it may become less desirable as a destination or as a hub location after Brexit when compared to other airports in Europe. Brexit could also lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty such as the identity of the relevant regulators, new regulatory action and/or potentially divergent treaties, laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU treaties, laws and regulations to replace or replicate, including those governing aviation, labor, environmental, data protection/privacy, competition and other matters applicable to the provision of air transportation services by us or our alliance, joint business or codeshare partners. For example in October 2018, in anticipation of Brexit and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020, the CMA opened an investigation into the transatlantic JBA. We continue to fully cooperate with the CMA. The impact on our business of any treaties, laws and regulations that replace the existing EU counterparts, or other governmental or regulatory actions taken by the United Kingdom or the EU in 24connection with or subsequent to Brexit, cannot be predicted, including whether or not regulators will continue to approve or impose material conditions on our business activities. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns.Acts of terrorism or fear of such attacks, including elevated national threat warnings, wars or other military conflicts, may depress air travel, particularly on international routes, and cause declines in revenues and increases in costs. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and continuing terrorist threats, attacks and attempted attacks materially impacted and continue to impact air travel. Increased security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks of September 11, 2001 and any other such measures that may be introduced in the future generate higher operating costs for airlines. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals on board flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency and enhanced background checks. A concurrent increase in airport security charges and procedures, such as restrictions on carry-on baggage, has also had and may continue to have a disproportionate impact on short-haul travel, which constitutes a significant portion of our flying and revenue. Implementation of and compliance with increasingly-complex security and customs requirements will continue to result in increased costs for us and our passengers, and have caused and likely will continue to cause periodic service disruptions and delays. We have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. As a result of competitive pressure, and the need to improve security screening throughput to support the pace of our operations, it is unlikely that we will be able to capture all security-related costs through increased fares. In addition, we cannot forecast what new security requirements may be imposed in the future, or their impact on our business.We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure. There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and emissions of GHGs, including CO2. In particular, ICAO is in the process of adopting rules, including CORSIA, that will require American to limit the CO2 emissions of a significant majority of our international flights to a baseline level equal to our 2019-2020 average emissions from such flights.At this time, the costs of our obligations under CORSIA are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. For example, we will not directly control our CORSIA compliance costs during the CORSIA Pilot and First Phases because such phases include a sharing mechanism for the growth in emissions for the global aviation sector. In addition, there is uncertainty with respect to the future supply, demand and price of sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel, carbon offset credits and technologies that could allow airlines to reduce their emissions of CO2. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market for air travel, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares, impose surcharges or otherwise increase revenues or decrease other operating costs sufficiently to offset our costs of meeting obligations under CORSIA.In the event that CORSIA does not come into force as expected, American and other airlines could become subject to an unpredictable and inconsistent array of national or regional emissions restrictions, creating a patchwork of complex regulatory requirements that will often affect global competitors differently and frequently offer no meaningful aviation environmental improvements. Concerns over climate change are likely to result in the continued adoption of municipal, state, regional, and federal requirements or in changing business environments that may result in increased costs to the airline industry and us. In addition, several countries and U.S. states have adopted or are considering adopting programs to regulate GHG emissions. Finally, certain airports have adopted, and others could in the future adopt, GHG emission or climate-neutral goals that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure.All such climate change-related regulatory activity and developments may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, make capital investments to modernize certain aspects of our operations, purchase carbon offset credits, or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs.25Finally, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires, sea-level rise and other climate-related events, could affect our operations, infrastructure and financial results. Operational impacts, such as the canceling of flights, could result in loss of revenue. We could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climate change. We are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change.We are subject to many forms of environmental and noise regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result.We are subject to a number of increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and noise reduction, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties.We are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations, including those that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of waste directly attributable to us. We have liability for investigation and remediation costs at various sites, although such costs currently are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.We have various leases and agreements with respect to real property, tanks and pipelines with airports and other operators. Under these leases and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor or operator against environmental liabilities associated with the real property or operations described under the agreement, even in certain cases where we are not the party responsible for the initial event that caused the environmental damage. We also participate in leases with other airlines in fuel consortiums and fuel committees at airports, and such indemnities are generally joint and several among the participating airlines.Governmental authorities in several U.S. and foreign cities are also considering, or have already implemented, aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews and limitations on daytime take offs and landings. We have been able to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, but our operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts.We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and many aircraft and engine parts. For example, under our current fleet plan, by the end of 2020 all of our mainline aircraft will have been manufactured by either Airbus or Boeing and all of our regional aircraft will have been manufactured by either Bombardier or Embraer. Further, our supplier base continues to consolidate as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies, the recent transactions involving Airbus and Bombardier and the pending transactions involving Boeing and Embraer, and Bombardier and Mitsubishi. Due to the limited number of these suppliers, we are vulnerable to any problems associated with the performance of their obligation to supply key aircraft, parts and engines, including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by suppliers, adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance of any of our aircraft or any action by the FAA or any other regulatory authority resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft, even temporarily. In particular, in March 2019, the FAA ordered the grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which remains in place as of the date of this report.Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of our business depends on, among other things, effectively managing the number and types of aircraft we operate. If, for any reason, we are unable to accept or secure deliveries of new aircraft on contractually scheduled delivery dates, this could have negative impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to integrate newly purchased aircraft into our fleet as planned might require us to seek extensions of the terms for some leased aircraft or otherwise delay the exit of certain aircraft from our fleet. Such unanticipated extensions or delays may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them, resulting in increased maintenance costs, or reductions to our schedule, thereby reducing revenues. If new aircraft orders are not filled on a timely basis, we could face higher financing and operating costs than planned. In addition, if the aircraft we 26receive do not meet expected performance or quality standards, including with respect to fuel efficiency, safety and reliability, we could face higher financing and operating costs than planned and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. For instance, in March 2019, the FAA grounded all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, including the 24 aircraft in our fleet. For the duration of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding, we have been unable to take delivery of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft we have on order from Boeing and have in some instances been required to extend the service lives of older, less efficient aircraft and delay service that we planned to offer. Further, deliveries of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft have remained suspended following the grounding, and Boeing is not currently manufacturing new 737 MAX aircraft. Depending on the ultimate duration of the grounding, various Boeing 737 MAX aircraft financings we previously obtained may be terminated and, as a result, we may be required to obtain alternate financing for these aircraft, which may not be available on terms and conditions as favorable as the previously obtained financings. Further, once the grounding has been lifted, we are likely to be subject to training requirements. Boeing has recommended that pilots receive special flight simulator training before operating the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, and although the FAA is ultimately responsible for establishing training requirements for operating the Boeing 737 MAX, such additional training would further delay the aircraft’s return to service and impose restrictions on our ability to optimize our fleet. This and other operational requirements and uncertainties regarding the timing of the delivery of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft we have on order and how rapidly we will be able to take delivery of and integrate such Boeing 737 MAX aircraft into our fleet could potentially result in further significant constraints on our operating efficiency, capacity and growth plans.We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on existing and emerging technology and automated systems to operate our business. These technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation system, flight operations systems, financial planning, management and accounting systems, telecommunications systems, website, maintenance systems and check-in kiosks. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver flight information, as well as issue electronic tickets and process critical financial information in a timely manner. Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets. We depend on our reservation system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party service provider, to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. If our technologies or automated systems are not functioning or if our third-party service providers were to fail to adequately provide technical support, system maintenance or timely software upgrades for any one of our key existing systems, we could experience service disruptions or delays, which could harm our business and result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues. In the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operations or fails to perform as promised, replacement services may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all, and any transition time to a new system may be significant.Our technologies and automated systems cannot be completely protected against events that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, data theft, equipment and software failures, computer viruses or telecommunications failures. Substantial or sustained system failures could cause service delays or failures and result in our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. We cannot assure that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans are adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. Disruption in or changes to these technologies or systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We face challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems. While we have to date successfully integrated many of our computer, communication and other technology systems in connection with the merger of US Airways and American, including our customer reservations system and our pilot, flight attendant and fleet scheduling system, we still have to complete several additional important system integration or replacement projects. In a number of prior airline mergers, the integration of these systems or deployment of replacement systems has taken longer, been more disruptive and cost more than originally forecasted. The implementation process to integrate or replace these various systems will involve a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. New systems will replace multiple legacy systems and the related implementation will be a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware, software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business and financial processes.27We cannot assure that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans will be adequate to prevent disruptions or delays in connection with systems integration or replacement. Disruptions in or changes to these systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Evolving data security and privacy requirements could increase our costs, and any significant data security incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business requires the secure processing and storage of sensitive information relating to our customers, employees, business partners and others. However, like any global enterprise operating in today’s digital business environment, we are subject to threats to the security of our networks and data, including threats potentially involving criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored actors, corporate espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. These threats continue to increase as the frequency, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions increase around the world. We have been the target of cybersecurity attacks in the past and expect that we will continue to be in the future. Furthermore, in response to these threats there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and cybersecurity in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere, particularly with respect to critical infrastructure providers, including those in the transportation sector. As a result, we must comply with a proliferating and fast-evolving set of legal requirements in this area, including substantive cybersecurity standards as well as requirements for notifying regulators and affected individuals in the event of a data security incident. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks. For example, in May 2018, the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation, commonly referred to as GDPR, came into effect, which imposes a host of new data privacy and security requirements, imposing significant costs on us and carrying substantial penalties for non-compliance. In addition, many of our commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that we must meet. In particular, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by the credit card companies, to comply with their highest level of data security standards. While we continue our efforts to meet these standards, new and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs. A significant cybersecurity incident could result in a range of potentially material negative consequences for us, including unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of company systems or data; theft of sensitive, regulated or confidential data, such as personal identifying information or our intellectual property; the loss of functionality of critical systems through ransomware, denial of service or other attacks; a deterioration in our relationships with business partners and other third parties; and business delays, service or system disruptions, damage to equipment and injury to persons or property. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. The constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. Similarly, we depend on the ability of our key commercial partners, including our regional carriers, distribution partners and technology vendors, to conduct their businesses in a manner that complies with applicable security standards and assures their ability to perform on a timely basis. A security failure, including a failure to meet relevant payment security standards, breach or other significant cybersecurity incident affecting one of our partners could result in potentially material negative consequences for us.In addition, the costs and operational consequences of defending against, preparing for, responding to and remediating an incident of cybersecurity breach may be substantial. As cybersecurity threats become more frequent, intense and sophisticated, costs of proactive defense measures are increasing. Further, we could be exposed to litigation, regulatory enforcement or other legal action as a result of an incident, carrying the potential for damages, fines, sanctions or other penalties, as well as injunctive relief and enforcement actions requiring costly compliance measures. A significant number of recent privacy and data security incidents, including those involving other large airlines, have resulted in very substantial adverse financial consequences to those companies. A cybersecurity incident could also impact our brand, harm our reputation and adversely impact our relationship with our customers, employees and stockholders. Accordingly, failure to appropriately address these issues could result in material financial and other liabilities and cause significant reputational harm to our company.28If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.A significant portion of our regional operations are conducted by third-party operators on our behalf, substantially all of which are provided for under capacity purchase agreements. Due to our reliance on third parties to provide these essential services, we are subject to the risk of disruptions to their operations, which has in the past and may in the future result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this report, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions, the inability of third parties to hire or retain skilled personnel, including pilots and mechanics, and other risk factors, such as an out-of-court or bankruptcy restructuring of any of our regional operators. Several of these third-party regional operators provide significant regional capacity that we would be unable to replace in a short period of time should that operator fail to perform its obligations to us. Disruptions to capital markets, shortages of skilled personnel and adverse economic conditions in general have subjected certain of these third-party regional operators to significant financial pressures, which have in the past and may in the future lead to bankruptcies among these operators. We may also experience disruption to our regional operations if we terminate the capacity purchase agreement with one or more of our current operators and transition the services to another provider. Any significant disruption to our regional operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, our reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of our operations may result in our relative inability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. We have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, reservations, provision of information technology and services, regional operations, aircraft maintenance, ground services and facilities and baggage handling. Similar agreements may be entered into in any new markets we decide to serve. These agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party service provider. We are also at risk should one of these service providers cease operations, and there is no guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis with comparably priced providers, or at all. Any material problems with the efficiency and timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.We rely on third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (GDSs) (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents, travel management companies and online travel agents (OTAs) (e.g., Expedia, including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity, and Booking Holdings, including its booking sites Kayak and Priceline), to distribute a significant portion of our airline tickets, and we expect in the future to continue to rely on these channels. We are also dependent upon the ability and willingness of these distribution channels to expand their ability to distribute and collect revenues for ancillary products (e.g., fees for selective seating). These distribution channels are more expensive and at present have less functionality in respect of ancillary product offerings than those we operate ourselves, such as our website at www.aa.com. Certain of these distribution channels also effectively restrict the manner in which we distribute our products generally. To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of our distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. Further, as distribution technology changes we will need to continue to update our technology by acquiring new technology from third parties, building the functionality ourselves, or a combination, which in any event will likely entail significant technological and commercial risk and involve potentially material investments. These imperatives may affect our relationships with conventional travel agents, travel management companies, GDSs and OTAs, including if consolidation of conventional travel agents, travel management companies, GDSs or OTAs continues, or should any of these parties seek to acquire other technology providers thereby potentially limiting our technology alternatives, such as the proposed acquisition of Farelogix by Sabre. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.29If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.In order to operate our existing and proposed flight schedule and, where desirable, add service along new or existing routes, we must be able to maintain and/or obtain adequate gates, check-in counters, operations areas, operations control facilities and administrative support space. As airports around the world become more congested, it may not be possible for us to ensure that our plans for new service can be implemented in a commercially viable manner, given operating constraints at airports throughout our network, including those imposed by inadequate facilities at desirable airports.In light of constraints on existing facilities, there is presently a significant amount of capital spending underway at major airports in the United States, including large projects underway at a number of airports where we have significant operations, such as DCA, LAX, LGA and ORD. This spending is expected to result in increased costs to airlines and the traveling public that use those facilities as the airports seek to recover their investments through increased rental, landing and other facility costs. In some circumstances, such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without our approval. Accordingly, our operating costs are expected to increase significantly at many airports at which we operate, including a number of our hubs and gateways, as a result of capital spending projects currently underway and additional projects that we expect to commence over the next several years. In addition, operations at three major domestic airports, certain smaller domestic airports and many foreign airports we serve are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period and may have other operational restrictions as well. In the U.S., the DOT and the FAA currently regulate the allocation of slots or slot exemptions at DCA and two New York City airports: JFK and LGA. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or similar regulatory authority. In addition to slot restrictions, operations at DCA and LGA are also limited based on a so-called “perimeter rule” which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1,250 and 1,500 miles, respectively. Similarly, our operations at LHR, international airports in Beijing, Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo and other airports outside the U.S. are regulated by local slot authorities pursuant to the IATA Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and/or applicable local law. Termination of slot controls at some or all of the foregoing airports could affect our operational performance and competitive position. We currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally, but not always, been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient slots or analogous authorizations in the future or as to the cost of acquiring such rights because, among other reasons, such allocations are often sought after by other airlines and are subject to changes in governmental policies. We cannot provide any assurance that regulatory changes regarding the allocation of slots, the continued enforcement of a perimeter rule or similar regulatory authority will not have a material adverse impact on our operations.Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as LAX and ORD where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.Any limitation on our ability to acquire or maintain adequate gates, ticketing facilities, operations areas, operations control facilities, slots (where applicable), or office space could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operations.We operate principally through our hubs and gateways in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, London Heathrow, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Substantially all of our flights either originate at or fly into one of these locations. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs, gateways or other airports where we have a significant presence, resulting from ATC delays, weather conditions, natural disasters, growth constraints, performance by third-party service providers (such as electric utility or telecommunications providers), failure of computer systems, disruptions at airport facilities or other key facilities used by us to manage our operations (such as occurred in the United Kingdom at LGW on December 20, 2018 and LHR on January 8, 2019 due to unauthorized drone activity), labor relations, power supplies, fuel supplies, terrorist activities, or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have limited control, particularly in the short term, over the operation, quality or maintenance of many of the services on which our operations depend and over whether vendors of such services will improve or continue to provide services that are essential to our business.30Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.We have recently instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our business model designed to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures include further segmentation of the classes of services we offer, such as Premium Economy service and Basic Economy service, enhancements to our AAdvantage loyalty program, charging separately for services that had previously been included within the price of a ticket, increasing other pre-existing fees, reconfiguration of our aircraft cabins, and efforts to optimize our network including by focusing growth on a limited number of large hubs. We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on, we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional initiatives. We cannot assure that these measures or any future initiatives will be successful in increasing our revenues. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that could harm the operational performance of our airline or result in decreased demand. Also, our implementation of any new or increased fees might reduce the demand for air travel on our airline or across the industry in general, particularly if weakened economic conditions make our customers more sensitive to increased travel costs or provide a significant competitive advantage to other carriers that determine not to institute similar charges.Our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results. We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights such as our trademarks applicable to our airline and AAdvantage loyalty program, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, copyright and other forms of legal protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, either of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.From time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Although we will vigorously defend ourselves in such legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain. For these and other reasons, we may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit. If a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief imposed on us. If our existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to operate or market our services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business. Additional information regarding certain legal matters in which we are involved can be found in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.A higher than normal number of pilot retirements, more stringent duty time regulations, increased flight hour requirement for commercial airline pilots, reductions in the number of military pilots entering the commercial workforce, increased training requirements and other factors have caused a shortage of pilots that could materially adversely affect our business.We currently have a higher than normal number of pilots eligible for retirement. Large numbers of pilots in the industry are approaching the FAA’s mandatory retirement age of 65. Our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements. Commencing in 2013, the minimum flight hour requirement to achieve a commercial pilot’s license in the United States (an Air Transport Pilot’s certificate) increased from 250 to 1,500 hours, thereby significantly increasing the time and cost commitment required to become licensed to fly commercial aircraft. Additionally, the number of military pilots being trained by the U.S. armed forces and available as commercial pilots upon their retirement from military service has been decreasing. These and other factors have contributed to a shortage of qualified, entry-level pilots and increased compensation costs, 31particularly for our regional subsidiaries and our other regional partners who are being required by market conditions to pay significantly increased wages and large signing bonuses to their pilots in an attempt to achieve desired staffing levels. The foregoing factors have also led to increased competition from large, mainline carriers attempting to meet their hiring needs. We believe that this industry-wide pilot shortage is becoming an increasing problem for airlines in the United States. Our regional partners have recently been unable to hire adequate numbers of pilots to meet their needs, resulting in a reduction in the number of flights offered, disruptions, increased costs of operations, financial difficulties and other adverse effects, and these circumstances may become more severe in the future and thereby cause a material adverse effect on our business.Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact our operations and financial results.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers. Accordingly, our insurance costs increased significantly, and our ability to continue to obtain insurance even at current prices remains uncertain. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the claims paying ability of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. Because of competitive pressures in our industry, our ability to pass along additional insurance costs to passengers is limited. As a result, further increases in insurance costs or reductions in available insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial results.The airline industry is heavily taxed.The airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue and profitability. The U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries. These fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights, and various U.S. fees and taxes also are assessed on international flights. For example, as permitted by federal legislation, most major U.S. airports impose a per-passenger facility charge on us. In addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us, various fees and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent years. Moreover, we are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on domestic and international air transportation. We collect the excise tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation (such as passenger security fees), and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. There are continuing efforts in Congress and in other countries to raise different portions of the various taxes, fees, and charges imposed on airlines and their passengers, including the passenger facility charge, and we may not be able to recover all of these charges from our customers. Increases in such taxes, fees and charges could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under DOT regulations, all governmental taxes and fees must be included in the prices we quote or advertise to our customers. Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the customer. Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel, and thus our revenues.Our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards may be limited.Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards). As of December 31, 2019, we had available NOL Carryforwards of approximately $9.1 billion for regular federal income tax purposes that will expire, if unused, beginning in 2023, and approximately $3.0 billion for state income tax purposes that will expire, if unused, between 2020 and 2039. Our NOL Carryforwards are subject to adjustment on audit by the Internal Revenue Service and the respective state taxing authorities.A corporation’s ability to deduct its federal NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). In 2013, we experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $7.3 billion of unlimited NOL still remaining at December 31, 2019) of our 32federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382. If the special rules are determined not to apply, our ability to utilize such federal NOL Carryforwards may be subject to limitation. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL Carryforwards attributable to US Airways Group and its subsidiaries are subject to limitation under Section 382 as a result of the Merger; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.Notwithstanding the foregoing, an ownership change subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards, our Certificate of Incorporation contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of AAG common stock. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, no assurance can be given that an ownership change will not occur even with these restrictions in place. See also “Certain provisions of AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial.” Our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards also will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. The NOL Carryforwards may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them.The commercial relationships that we have with other airlines, including any related equity investment, may not produce the returns or results we expect.An important part of our strategy to expand our network has been to expand our commercial relationships with other airlines, such as by entering into global alliance, joint business and codeshare relationships, and, in one recent instance involving China Southern Airlines Company Limited (China Southern Airlines), by making a significant equity investment in another airline in connection with initiating such a commercial relationship. We may explore similar non-controlling investments in, and joint ventures and strategic alliances with, other carriers as part of our global business strategy. We face competition in forming and maintaining these commercial relationships since there are a limited number of potential arrangements and other airlines are looking to enter into similar relationships, and our inability to form or maintain these relationships or inability to form as many of these relationships as our competitors may have an adverse effect on our business. Any such existing or future investment could involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, our failure to maintain certain levels of liquidity), to hold an amount of our cash (a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. These credit card processing companies are not currently entitled to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. The imposition of holdback requirements, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, would materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other entities to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition.We have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. In addition, we are required to assess certain of our other long-lived assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.33Future impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets could be recorded in results of operations as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that a material impairment charge of goodwill or tangible or intangible assets will be avoided. The value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by us or other airlines. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The price of AAG common stock has been and may in the future be volatile.The market price of AAG common stock has fluctuated in the past, and may fluctuate substantially in the future, due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:•macro-economic conditions, including the price of fuel;•changes in market values of airline companies as well as general market conditions;•our operating and financial results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;•changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;•changes in our level of outstanding indebtedness and other obligations;•changes in our credit ratings;•material announcements by us or our competitors;•expectations regarding our capital deployment program, including any existing or potential future share repurchase programs and any future dividend payments that may be declared by our Board of Directors, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends;•new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;•general and industry-specific economic conditions;•changes in our key personnel;•public sales of a substantial number of shares of AAG common stock or issuances of AAG common stock upon the exercise or conversion of restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, or other securities that may be issued from time to time;•increases or decreases in reported holdings by insiders or other significant stockholders; and•fluctuations in trading volume.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that our capital deployment program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Our capital deployment program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.Since July 2014, as part of our capital deployment program, our Board of Directors has approved seven share repurchase programs aggregating $13.0 billion of authority. As of December 31, 2019, there was $565 million of remaining authority to repurchase shares under our current $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. These share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Our repurchase of AAG common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.34Our Board of Directors commenced declaring quarterly cash dividends in July 2014 as part of our capital deployment program. However, any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future.In addition, any future repurchases of AAG common stock or payment of dividends, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends, could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, any future repurchases of AAG common stock or payment of dividends will diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Further, our repurchase of AAG common stock may fluctuate such that our cash flow may be insufficient to fully cover our share repurchases. Although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that they will do so. AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests.Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include significant provisions that limit voting and ownership and disposition of our equity interests, as described in Part II, Item 5. Market for American Airlines Group’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - “Ownership Restrictions” and AAG’s Description of the Registrants’ Securities Registered Pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG common stock and our other equity interests to vote such interests and adversely affect the ability of persons to acquire shares of AAG common stock and our other equity interests.Certain provisions of AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial.Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as currently in effect, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following:•advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders’ meetings;•the ability of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the board;•a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent;•stockholders are restricted from calling a special meeting unless they hold at least 20% of our outstanding shares and follow the procedures provided for in the amended Bylaws;•a requirement that holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors approve any amendment of our Bylaws submitted to stockholders for approval; and•super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation.These provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize the value of the interests of our stockholders. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable our Board of Directors to prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. Interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is approved by the Board of Directors prior to the investment under Section 203.35ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSWe had no unresolved Securities and Exchange Commission staff comments that were issued 180 days or more preceding December 31, 2019.36ITEM 2. PROPERTIESFlight Equipment and Fleet RenewalAs of December 31, 2019, American operated a mainline fleet of 942 aircraft. In 2019, we continued our extensive fleet renewal program, which has provided us with the youngest fleet of the major U.S. network carriers. During 2019, American took delivery of 24 mainline aircraft and retired 38 mainline aircraft. We are supported by our wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers that fly under capacity purchase agreements operating as American Eagle. As of December 31, 2019, American Eagle operated 605 regional aircraft. During 2019, we increased our regional fleet by a net of ten aircraft, including the addition of 46 regional aircraft and retirement of 36 regional aircraft. MainlineAs of December 31, 2019, American’s mainline fleet consisted of the following aircraft: Average SeatingCapacity AverageAge(Years) Owned Leased TotalAirbus A319128 15.7 21 111 132Airbus A320150 18.7 10 38 48Airbus A321179 7.4 165 53 218Airbus A321neo196 0.4 2 10 12Airbus A330-200247 8.0 15 — 15Airbus A330-300291 19.4 4 5 9Boeing 737-800163 10.1 132 172 304Boeing 737-8 MAX (1)172 1.4 9 15 24Boeing 757-200180 20.1 31 3 34Boeing 767-300ER209 19.9 17 — 17Boeing 777-200ER273 19.0 44 3 47Boeing 777-300ER304 5.8 18 2 20Boeing 787-8234 4.1 20 — 20Boeing 787-9285 2.2 17 5 22Embraer 19099 12.1 20 — 20Total 11.0 525 417 942 (1) On March 13, 2019, a directive from the FAA grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. We have removed all Boeing 737 MAX flying from our flight schedule through August 17, 2020 and will continue to assess this timeline.37RegionalAs of December 31, 2019, the fleet of our wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle consisted of the following aircraft: Average SeatingCapacity Owned Leased Owned or Leasedby Third PartyRegional Carrier Total Operating RegionalCarrier Number ofAircraftOperatedBombardier CRJ 20050 12 7 — 19 PSA 19 Bombardier CRJ 70066 54 7 60 121 SkyWest 60 PSA 56 Envoy 5 Total 121 Bombardier CRJ 90077 66 — 60 126 PSA 66 Mesa 60 Total 126 Embraer E17576 90 — 85 175 Republic 85 Envoy 70 Compass 20 Total 175 Embraer ERJ 140 (1)44 46 — — 46 Envoy 46 Embraer ERJ 14550 118 — — 118 Piedmont 60 Envoy 58 Total 118Total 386 14 205 605 605 (1) Excluded from the total operating aircraft count above are 12 owned Embraer ERJ 140s that are being held in temporary storage.

Actual delivery dates are subject to change based on many potential factors including production delays by the manufacturer. (2) In October 2019, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced a 10% tariff on new Airbus aircraft imported from Europe. Effective March 18, 2020, this tariff rate will increase to 15%. We are evaluating the impact of this tariff on our future Airbus deliveries. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - “We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.”(3) On March 13, 2019, a directive from the FAA grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. We currently have 76 Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft on order and we have not taken delivery of any Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft since the grounding. The extent of the delay to the scheduled deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft included in the table above is expected to be impacted by the length of time the FAA order remains in place, Boeing's production rate and the pace at which Boeing can deliver aircraft following the lifting of the FAA order, among other factors. The above table reflects our estimate of future Boeing 737 MAX aircraft deliveries based on information currently available to us; however, the actual delivery schedule may differ from the table above, potentially materially.We also have agreements for 34 spare engines to be delivered in 2020 and beyond.We currently have financing commitments in place for all aircraft on order and scheduled to be delivered through May 2020. Our ability to draw on the financing commitments we have in place is subject to the satisfaction of various terms and conditions, including in some cases, on our acquisition of the aircraft by a certain date. We do not have financing commitments in place for four aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2020: two Airbus A320neo Family aircraft and two Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft. We also do not have financing commitments in place for any of the aircraft scheduled to be delivered beyond 2020, except for 10 Boeing 787 Family aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2021. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors –“We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully” for additional discussion.See Note 12 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 10 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on aircraft and engine acquisition commitments.39Ground PropertiesAt each airport where we conduct flight operations, we have agreements, generally with a governmental unit or authority, for the use of passenger, operations and baggage handling space as well as runways and taxiways. These agreements, particularly in the U.S., often contain provisions for periodic adjustments to rates and charges applicable under such agreements. These rates and charges also vary with our level of operations and the operations of the airport. Additionally, at our hub locations and in certain other cities we serve, we lease administrative offices, catering, cargo, training, maintenance and other facilities.We lease or have built on leased property our headquarters and training facilities in Fort Worth, Texas, our principal overhaul and maintenance base in Tulsa, Oklahoma, our regional reservation offices, and administrative offices throughout the U.S. and abroad. Construction was completed in 2019 on our new headquarters on the corporate campus in Fort Worth, Texas.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSChapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger.Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. The shares of AAG common stock issued to the Disputed Claims Reserve were originally issued on December 13, 2013 and have at all times since been included in the number of shares issued and outstanding as reported from time to time in our quarterly and annual reports, including for purposes of calculating earnings per common share. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve. However, we are not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution in the Disputed Claims Reserve are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders and former convertible noteholders treated as stockholders under the Plan. As of December 31, 2019, the Disputed Claims Reserve held approximately 7 million shares of AAG common stock.Private Party Antitrust Action Related to Passenger Capacity. We, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, were named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits were consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia (the DC Court). On June 15, 2018, we reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the amount of $45 million to resolve all class claims in the U.S. lawsuits. That settlement was approved by the DC Court on May 13, 2019. Three parties who objected to the settlement have appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. We believe these appeals are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. Private Party Antitrust Action Related to the Merger. On August 6, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. AMR Corporation, et al., was filed in the Bankruptcy Court. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group, US Airways, AMR and American, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 29, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court denied in part defendants' motion for summary judgment, and fully denied plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment. The parties' evidentiary cases were presented before the Bankruptcy Court in a bench trial in March 2019. The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and made closing arguments in April 2019, and we are awaiting the Bankruptcy Court's decision. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.Pension Benefits Action. On December 11, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Torres, et al. v. American Airlines, Inc., The Employee Benefits Committee and John/Jane Does 1-5, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit purport to represent a class consisting of all participants in and beneficiaries under any of the four American defined benefit pension plans who elected to receive an optional form of benefit other than a lump sum distribution of a participant’s vested benefit. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), participants 40covered by defined benefit plans accrue retirement benefits in the form of a single life annuity payable upon retirement on a monthly basis until the employee’s death, and may elect certain alternative forms of benefit payments. Plaintiffs contend that the mortality tables used by American for purposes of calculations related to these alternative forms of benefits are outdated and that more recent mortality tables would have provided more generous benefits and should have been used to make those calculations. The court has denied our motion to dismiss the complaint. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could be material. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors –“We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity” for additional discussion.ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURESNot Applicable.41PART IIITEM 5.MARKET FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP’S COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESStock Exchange ListingOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AAL.” There is no trading market for the common stock of American, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG.As of February 14, 2020, the closing price of our common stock was $29.20 and there were 12,995 holders of record. However, because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we believe there are substantially more beneficial holders of our common stock than record holders. Information on securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans will be set forth in our Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of American Airlines Group Inc. (the Proxy Statement) under the caption “Equity Compensation Plan Information” and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Dividends on Common StockIn January 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share cash dividend for stockholders of record on February 5, 2020, and payable on February 19, 2020.The total cash payment for dividends during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $178 million and $186 million, respectively. Any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.Stock Performance GraphThe following stock performance graph and related information shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.The following stock performance graph compares the cumulative total stockholder returns during the period from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2019 of our common stock to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ARCA Airline Index and the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Stock Index. The comparison assumes $100 was invested on December 31, 2014 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.

Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved seven share repurchase programs aggregating $13.0 billion of authority. In 2019, we repurchased 33.8 million shares of AAG common stock for $1.1 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $32.09. In 2018, we repurchased 16.6 million shares of AAG common stock for $800 million at a weighted average cost per share of $48.15. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014 through December 31, 2019, we have repurchased 312.7 million shares of AAG common stock for $12.4 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $39.76.The following table displays information with respect to our purchases of shares of AAG common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2019.Period Total number ofshares purchased Average pricepaid per share Total number of sharespurchased as part of publicly announcedplan or program Maximum dollar value of sharesthat may be purchased underthe plan or program(in millions)October 2019 710,556 $30.65 710,556 $828November 2019 4,181,541 $29.42 4,181,541 $705December 2019 4,975,466 $28.12 4,975,466 $565Share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases that may be made from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares and our repurchase of AAG common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.43See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that our capital deployment program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Our capital deployment program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.”Ownership RestrictionsAAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that, consistent with the requirements of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code, as amended (the Aviation Act), any persons or entities who are not a “citizen of the United States” (as defined under the Aviation Act and administrative interpretations issued by the DOT, its predecessors and successors, from time to time), including any agent, trustee or representative of such persons or entities (a non-citizen), shall not, in the aggregate, own (beneficially or of record) and/or control more than (a) 24.9% of the aggregate votes of all of our outstanding equity securities or (b) 49.0% of our outstanding equity securities. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws further specify that it is the duty of each stockholder who is a non-citizen to register his, her or its equity securities on our foreign stock record and provide for remedies applicable to stockholders that exceed the voting and ownership caps described above.In addition, to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards and certain other tax attributes for federal income tax purposes, our Certificate of Incorporation contains certain restrictions on the acquisition and disposition of our common stock by substantial stockholders (generally holders of more than 4.75%).See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests.” Also see AAG’s Certification of Incorporation and Bylaws, which are filed as Exhibits 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 hereto, for the full text of the foregoing restrictions and AAG’s Description of the Registrants’ Securities Registered Pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto, for a more detailed description.44ITEM 6. SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATAWe adopted three new accounting standards as of January 1, 2018: Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) (the New Lease Standard), ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (the New Revenue Standard) and ASU 2017-07: Compensation - Retirement Benefits (the New Retirement Standard). The 2017 and 2016 financial information presented within Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data has been recast to reflect the impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard and the New Retirement Standard. The New Lease Standard did not require the recast of prior periods. See Note 1(b) to AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B, respectively, of AAG’s and American’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the 2018 Form 10-K), for further information on the impacts of these new accounting standards.Selected Consolidated Financial Data of AAGThe selected consolidated financial data presented below under the captions “Consolidated Statements of Operations data” and “Consolidated Balance Sheet data” for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are derived from AAG’s audited consolidated financial statements.

See Note 10 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information on pension and postretirement benefits.Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures We sometimes use financial measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.45The following table presents the components of our total net special items and the reconciliation of pre-tax income and net income (GAAP measures) to pre-tax income excluding net special items and net income excluding net special items (non-GAAP measures). Management uses pre-tax income excluding net special items and net income excluding net special items to evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As net special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude net special items allows management an additional tool to understand our core operating performance.

(6) Severance expenses primarily included costs associated with reductions of management and support staff team members.(7) Intangible asset impairment includes a non-cash charge to write-off our Brazil route authority as a result of the U.S.-Brazil open skies agreement.(8) Mark-to-market adjustments on equity and other investments, net primarily relates to net unrealized gains and losses associated with our equity investment in China Southern Airlines.(9) Income tax special items, net for 2018 included an $18 million charge related to an international income tax matter.Additionally, the table below presents the reconciliation of total operating expenses (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and net special items allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and core operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSBackgroundTogether with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, our airline operates an average of 6,800 flights per day to more than 365 destinations in 61 countries through our hubs and gateways in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, London Heathrow, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In 2019, approximately 215 million passengers boarded our flights.2019 Financial Overview AAG’s 2019 ResultsThe selected financial data presented below is derived from AAG’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8A of this report and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes thereto.

Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Note 2 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for details on the components of net special items.Pre-Tax Income and Net IncomePre-tax income and net income were $2.3 billion and $1.7 billion in 2019, respectively. This compares to 2018 pre-tax income and net income of $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The year-over-year increase in our pre-tax income on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items was principally driven by higher revenues and lower fuel costs, offset in part by increases in salaries, wages and benefits, maintenance expenses and costs associated with increased regional capacity.49Fleet and OperationBoeing 737 MAXOn March 13, 2019, a directive from the FAA grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Our fleet currently includes 24 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft with an additional 76 aircraft on order. As a result of this directive, we canceled approximately 27,600 flights in 2019. We have removed all Boeing 737 MAX flying from our flight schedule through August 17, 2020 and continue to assess this timeline.Our estimate of the financial damages incurred in 2019 due to the Boeing 737 MAX grounding and related cancellations was approximately $540 million.As previously announced in January 2020, we reached a confidential agreement with Boeing on compensation related to financial damages incurred in 2019 due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The settlement did not have a material impact on 2019 earnings because we are accounting for substantially all of the compensation as a reduction in cost basis of grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and certain future Boeing 737 MAX aircraft deliveries. Our future aircraft purchase commitments in Note 12 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A reflect the portion of the compensation we expect to receive in the future as Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are delivered. These amounts reflect our best estimate in light of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future Boeing 737 MAX aircraft deliveries.Due to the impact of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding on our 2019 financial results, our Board of Directors authorized a discretionary portion of the settlement to be returned to team members through our 2019 profit-sharing program. The profit-sharing award was based on our estimate of full-year 2019 financial damages for the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. As a result, an additional accrual of approximately $30 million was made to our 2019 profit-sharing program.We are pleased with the settlement agreement we reached for 2019, which was intended to address our financial damages incurred in 2019 due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. However, the aircraft remain grounded and therefore we continue to incur financial damages in 2020. We expect discussions to continue with Boeing for further compensation for these damages.Operational SlowdownIn 2019, the TWU-IAM Association engaged in an illegal work slowdown in an effort to influence contract negotiations. This slowdown significantly impacted our operation and caused a significant number of flight cancellations and delays in the second and third quarters of 2019. Agreements in principle were reached on January 30, 2020 for JCBAs covering all of the workgroups represented by the TWU-IAM Association. Those agreements are subject to membership ratification vote. RevenueIn 2019, we reported total operating revenues of $45.8 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 2.8%, as compared to 2018. Passenger revenue was $42.0 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 3.3%, as compared to 2018. The increase in passenger revenue in 2019 was due to continued strength in passenger demand resulting in a 4.4% increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and a 2.6 point increase in passenger load factor. Domestic passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) increased 2.0% as compared to 2018. Latin America was the best performing international region in 2019, with PRASM increasing 3.4% followed by Pacific with PRASM increasing 3.1%, while Atlantic PRASM declined 1.5% principally due to lower transfer payments related to our joint business arrangement and foreign currency effects.In 2019, cargo revenue was $863 million, a decrease of $150 million, or 14.8%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to a 14.4% decrease in cargo ton miles reflecting declines in freight volumes, principally as a result of international schedule reductions. Other operating revenue increased $43 million, or 1.5%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, principally driven by higher revenue associated with our airport clubs and loyalty program.Our total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 16.05 cents in 2019, a 1.7% increase as compared to 15.79 cents in 2018. FuelOur mainline and regional fuel expense totaled $9.4 billion in 2019, which was $501 million, or 5.1%, lower compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by a 6.9% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.07 in 2019 from $2.23 in 2018, offset in part by a 2.0% increase in gallons of fuel consumed.50As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.Other CostsWe remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel.Our 2019 total cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 14.98 cents, an increase of 0.9%, from 14.85 cents in 2018. Our 2019 CASM excluding net special items and fuel was 11.46 cents, an increase of 3.6%, from 11.06 cents in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher maintenance expenses, costs associated with increased regional capacity and lower than planned capacity in 2019 due to the Boeing 737 MAX grounding.For a reconciliation of CASM excluding net special items and fuel, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”LiquidityAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $7.0 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $3.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and $3.2 billion in undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facilities. We also had restricted cash and short-term investments of $158 million. During 2019, we completed the following significant financing transactions:•raised $3.2 billion from enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs) and other aircraft and flight equipment financing, of which $1.3 billion was used to repay existing indebtedness; •issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2022 (the 5.000% senior notes);•raised $850 million from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions; and•extended the maturities on $2.8 billion of our revolving credit facility commitments by one year from 2023 to 2024, and due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft return to service, entered into an additional $400 million short-term revolving line of credit. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on our debt obligations.Additionally, we returned $1.3 billion to our stockholders in 2019, including the repurchase of $1.1 billion of our common stock, or 33.8 million shares, and quarterly dividend payments totaling $178 million. Since our capital return program commenced in mid-2014, we have returned $13.6 billion to stockholders, including $12.4 billion in share repurchases, or 312.7 million shares, and $1.2 billion in quarterly dividend payments.51AAG’s Results of OperationsFor a comparison of the 2018 to 2017 reporting periods, see Part II, Item 7.

See detailed explanations below relating to changes in total CASM.Total CASMWe sometimes use financial measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, 53cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.The table below presents the reconciliation of total operating expenses (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and net special items allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and core operating performance.The major components of our total CASM and our total CASM excluding net special items and fuel for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows (amounts may not recalculate due to rounding): Year Ended December 31, PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2019 2018 (In cents, except percentage changes)Total CASM: Aircraft fuel and related taxes2.64 2.86 (7.5)Salaries, wages and benefits4.42 4.34 1.8Maintenance, materials and repairs0.83 0.73 14.9Other rent and landing fees0.72 0.67 7.0Aircraft rent0.47 0.45 3.8Selling expenses0.56 0.54 4.3Depreciation and amortization0.70 0.65 6.6Special items, net0.22 0.28 (20.2)Other1.78 1.80 (1.1)Regional expenses: Aircraft fuel and related taxes0.66 0.65 0.3Other1.98 1.88 5.3Total CASM14.98 14.85 0.9Mainline operating special items, net(0.22) (0.28) (20.2)Aircraft fuel and related taxes Aircraft fuel and related taxes - mainline(2.64) (2.86) (7.5)Aircraft fuel and related taxes - regional(0.66) (0.65) 0.3Total CASM, excluding net special items and fuel11.46 11.06 3.6Significant changes in the components of total CASM are as follows:•Mainline aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM decreased 7.5% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a 7.1% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.05 in 2019 from $2.21 in 2018. •Maintenance, materials and repairs per ASM increased 14.9% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a contract change that resulted in certain flight equipment transitioning to a flight hour based contract (referred to as power by the hour) whereby expense is incurred and recognized based on actual hours flown. Previously, this flight equipment was covered by a time and materials based contract whereby expense is incurred and recognized as maintenance is performed. An increase in the volume of airframe and engine overhauls performed under time and material based contracts as well as an increase in the volume of component part repairs also drove higher maintenance expenses in 2019.•Other rent and landing fees per ASM increased 7.0% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an expansion at DFW that became fully operational in May 2019 and rate increases at certain hub airports.54•Depreciation and amortization per ASM increased 6.6% in 2019 as compared to 2018 due in part to airport and other facility improvements and the harmonization of interior configurations across the mainline fleet. Depreciation associated with aircraft acquired as part of our fleet renewal program also contributed to the increase.•Regional aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM increased 0.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an 8.3% increase in gallons of fuel consumed, offset in part by a 6.4% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.15 in 2019 from $2.30 in 2018.•Regional other operating expenses per ASM increased 5.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by an 8.3% increase in regional capacity, principally from our wholly-owned regional carriers.Operating Special Items, Net Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (In millions)Fleet restructuring expenses (1)$271 $422Fleet impairment (2)213 —Merger integration expenses (3)191 268Litigation reserve adjustments(53) 45Mark-to-market adjustments on bankruptcy obligations, net (4)(11) (76)Severance expenses (5)11 58Intangible asset impairment (6)— 26Labor contract expenses— 13Other operating charges, net13 31Total mainline operating special items, net635 787Regional operating special items, net6 6Total operating special items, net$641 $793 (1) Fleet restructuring expenses principally included accelerated depreciation and rent expense for aircraft and related equipment grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.(2) Fleet impairment principally includes a non-cash write-down of aircraft related to the planned retirement of our Embraer E190 fleet.(3) Merger integration expenses included costs associated with integration projects, principally our technical operations, flight attendant, human resources and payroll systems.(4) Bankruptcy obligations that will be settled in shares of our common stock are marked-to-market based on our stock price.(5) Severance expenses primarily included costs associated with reductions of management and support staff team members.(6) Intangible asset impairment includes a non-cash charge to write-off our Brazil route authority as a result of the U.S.-Brazil open skies agreement.55Nonoperating Results Year Ended December 31, Increase(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2019 2018 (In millions, except percentage changes)Interest income$127 $118 $9 7.1Interest expense, net(1,095) (1,056) (39) 3.7Other income, net159 166 (7) (3.8)Total nonoperating expense, net$(809) $(772) $(37) 4.8Interest expense, net increased $39 million, or 3.7% in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower capitalized interest.In 2019, other nonoperating income, net principally included $183 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by $32 million of net foreign currency losses principally associated with losses from Latin American currencies.In 2018, other nonoperating income, net principally included $308 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by a $104 million net special charge for mark-to-market unrealized losses primarily associated with our equity investment in China Southern Airlines and $55 million of net foreign currency losses from Latin American currencies.The decrease in non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income in 2019 as compared to 2018 is principally due to a decrease in the expected return on pension plan assets.Income TaxesIn 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $570 million at an effective rate of approximately 25%, which was substantially non-cash due to utilization of our net operating losses (NOLs). Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $9.1 billion of federal NOLs and $3.0 billion of state NOLs, substantially all of which we expect to be available in 2020 to reduce future federal and state taxable income.In 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $472 million at an effective rate of approximately 25%, which was substantially non-cash. This provision included an $18 million special income tax charge related to an international income tax matter.See Note 7 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.American’s Results of OperationsFor a comparison of the 2018 to 2017 reporting periods, see Part II, Item 7.

Domestic PRASM increased in 2019 as compared to 2018. Latin America PRASM was the best performing international region in 2019, followed by Pacific PRASM, while Atlantic PRASM declined principally due to lower transfer payments related to American’s joint business arrangement and foreign currency effects. Cargo revenue decreased $150 million, or 14.8%, in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to a decrease in cargo ton miles reflecting declines in international freight volumes, principally as a result of international schedule reductions.Other operating revenue increased $47 million, or 1.7% in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to higher revenue associated with American’s airport clubs and loyalty program.Total operating revenues in 2019 increased $1.2 billion, or 2.8%, from 2018 driven principally by a 3.3% increase in passenger revenue as described above.Operating Expenses Year EndedDecember 31, Increase(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2019 2018 (In millions, except percentage changes)Aircraft fuel and related taxes$7,526 $8,053 $(527) (6.5)Salaries, wages and benefits12,600 12,240 360 2.9Maintenance, materials and repairs2,380 2,050 330 16.1Other rent and landing fees2,055 1,900 155 8.2Aircraft rent1,326 1,264 62 4.9Selling expenses1,602 1,520 82 5.4Depreciation and amortization1,982 1,839 143 7.7Mainline operating special items, net635 787 (152) (19.4)Other5,090 5,090 — —Regional expenses: Aircraft fuel and related taxes1,869 1,843 26 1.4Other5,649 5,221 428 8.2Total operating expenses$42,714 $41,807 $907 2.2Total operating expenses increased $907 million, or 2.2%, in 2019 from 2018. Significant changes in the components of American’s total operating expenses are as follows:•Mainline aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased 6.5% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a 7.1% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.05 in 2019 from $2.21 in 2018. •Maintenance, materials and repairs increased 16.1% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a contract change that resulted in certain flight equipment transitioning to a flight hour based contract (referred to as power by the hour) whereby expense is incurred and recognized based on actual hours flown. Previously, this flight equipment was covered by a time and materials based contract whereby expense is incurred and recognized as maintenance is performed.

Depreciation associated with aircraft acquired as part of American’s fleet renewal program also contributed to the increase. 57•Regional aircraft fuel and related taxes increased 1.4% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an 8.3% increase in gallons of fuel consumed, offset in part by a 6.4% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.15 in 2019 from $2.30 in 2018.•Regional other operating expenses increased 8.2% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by an increase in regional capacity.Operating Special Items, Net Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 (In millions)Fleet restructuring expenses (1)$271 $422Fleet impairment (2)213 —Merger integration expenses (3)191 268Litigation reserve adjustments(53) 45Mark-to-market adjustments on bankruptcy obligations, net (4)(11) (76)Severance expenses (5)11 58Intangible asset impairment (6)— 26Labor contract expenses— 13Other operating charges, net13 31Total mainline operating special items, net$635 $787(1) Fleet restructuring expenses principally included accelerated depreciation and rent expense for aircraft and related equipment grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.(2) Fleet impairment principally includes a non-cash write-down of aircraft related to the planned retirement of American's Embraer E190 fleet.(3) Merger integration expenses included costs associated with integration projects, principally American's technical operations, flight attendant, human resources and payroll systems.(4) Bankruptcy obligations that will be settled in shares of AAG common stock are marked-to-market based on AAG’s stock price.(5) Severance expenses primarily included costs associated with reductions of management and support staff team members.(6) Intangible asset impairment includes a non-cash charge to write-off American’s Brazil route authority as a result of the U.S.-Brazil open skies agreement.Nonoperating Results Year EndedDecember 31, Increase(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2019 2018 (In millions, except percentage changes)Interest income$515 $330 $185 56.1Interest expense, net(1,109) (1,028) (81) 7.8Other income, net152 167 (15) (9.3)Total nonoperating expense, net$(442) $(531) $89 (16.9)Interest income increased $185 million, or 56.1%, due to higher interest-bearing related party receivables from American’s parent company, AAG in 2019 as compared to 2018.58Interest expense, net increased $81 million, or 7.8%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher-interest bearing related party payables to other AAG subsidiaries and lower capitalized interest.In 2019, other nonoperating income, net principally included $183 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by $32 million of net foreign currency losses principally associated with losses from Latin American currencies.In 2018, other nonoperating income, net principally included $309 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by a $104 million net special charge for mark-to-market unrealized losses primarily associated with American’s equity investment in China Southern Airlines and $54 million of net foreign currency losses from Latin American currencies.The decrease in non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income in 2019 as compared to 2018 is principally due to a decrease in the expected return on pension plan assets.Income TaxesAmerican is part of the AAG consolidated income tax return.In 2019, American recorded an income tax provision of $633 million at an effective rate of approximately 24%, which was substantially non-cash due to utilization of its NOLs. Substantially all of American’s income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2019, American had approximately $9.2 billion of federal NOLs and $2.9 billion of state NOLs, substantially all of which American expects to be available in 2020 to reduce future federal and state taxable income.In 2018, American recorded an income tax provision of $534 million at an effective rate of approximately 24%, which was substantially non-cash. This provision included an $18 million special income tax charge related to an international income tax matter.See Note 5 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidityAs of December 31, 2019, AAG had approximately $7.0 billion in total available liquidity and $158 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additional detail regarding our available liquidity is provided in the table below (in millions): AAG American December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018Cash$280 $275 $267 $265Short-term investments3,546 4,485 3,543 4,482Undrawn revolving credit facilities (1)3,243 2,843 3,243 2,843Total available liquidity$7,069 $7,603 $7,053 $7,590 (1) For 2019, this amount includes $400 million in borrowing capacity under a short-term revolving line of credit we arranged in December 2019 due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft return to service. We have no present intention to borrow any amounts under this facility, which matures in September 2020 with an optional extension to December 2020. For additional discussion of this facility see Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.59Share Repurchase ProgramsIn April 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program that will expire on December 31, 2020. Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved seven share repurchase programs aggregating $13.0 billion of authority. As of December 31, 2019, there was $565 million of remaining authority to repurchase shares under our current $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases that may be made from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares and our repurchase of AAG common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.In 2019, we repurchased 33.8 million shares of AAG common stock for $1.1 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $32.09. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014 through December 31, 2019, we have repurchased 312.7 million shares of AAG common stock for $12.4 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $39.76.Cash DividendsOur Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends during 2019:Period Per share For stockholders of record as of Payable on Total (millions)First Quarter $0.10 February 6, 2019 February 20, 2019 $46Second Quarter 0.10 May 8, 2019 May 22, 2019 44Third Quarter 0.10 August 7, 2019 August 21, 2019 44Fourth Quarter 0.10 November 6, 2019 November 20, 2019 44Total $0.40 $178In January 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share cash dividend for stockholders of record on February 5, 2020, and payable on February 19, 2020.Any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.Collateral-Related CovenantsCertain of our debt financing agreements (including our term loans, revolving credit facilities and spare engine EETCs) contain loan to value ratio covenants and require us to appraise the related collateral annually. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold or the value of the appraised collateral fails to meet a specified threshold, as the case may be, we are required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash or investment securities), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the foregoing collateral coverage tests as of the most recent applicable measurement dates. For further information regarding our collateral-related covenants, see Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.Sources and Uses of CashFor a comparison of the 2018 and 2017 reporting periods, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Sources and Uses of Cash” of our 2018 Form 10-K.AAG2019 Compared to 2018 Operating ActivitiesOur net cash provided by operating activities was $3.8 billion and $3.5 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $282 million. This increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher profitability in 2019 as well as working capital increases principally in our air traffic liability and loyalty program deferred revenue. These increases were offset in part by higher contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2019 as compared to 2018.60Investing ActivitiesOur net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.Our principal investing activities in 2019 included expenditures of $4.3 billion for property and equipment, including 21 Embraer E175 aircraft, 12 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, four Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and two Boeing 787 Family aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $960 million in net sales of short-term investments, $850 million of proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $250 million in proceeds from a vendor.Our principal investing activities in 2018 included expenditures of $3.7 billion for property and equipment, including 16 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, six Boeing 787 family aircraft and five Embraer E175 aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.1 billion of proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $293 million in net sales of short-term investments.Financing ActivitiesOur net cash used in financing activities was $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.Our principal financing activities in 2019 included $4.2 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $2.9 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the prepayment of $1.3 billion of secured loans. We also had $1.1 billion in share repurchases and $178 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset in part by $4.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, consisting of $3.2 billion in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and other flight equipment, as well as the issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes.Our principal financing activities in 2018 included $2.9 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $2.4 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the prepayment of $513 million of secured loans. We also had $837 million in share repurchases and $186 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset in part by $2.4 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, consisting of $1.9 billion in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and pre-delivery purchase deposits, as well as an incremental $500 million on a term loan facility.American2019 Compared to 2018Operating ActivitiesAmerican’s net cash provided by operating activities was $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $486 million. This increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher profitability in 2019 as well as working capital increases principally in American's air traffic liability and loyalty program deferred revenue. These increases were offset in part by higher contributions to American's defined benefit pension plans in 2019 as compared to 2018.Investing ActivitiesAmerican’s net cash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.American’s principal investing activities in 2019 included expenditures of $4.2 billion for property and equipment, including 21 Embraer E175 aircraft, 12 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, four Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and two Boeing 787 Family aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $960 million in net sales of short-term investments, $850 million of proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $250 million in proceeds from a vendor.American’s principal investing activities in 2018 included expenditures of $3.7 billion for property and equipment, including 16 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, six Boeing 787 family aircraft and five Embraer E175 aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.1 billion of proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $293 million in net sales of short-term investments.Financing ActivitiesAmerican’s net cash used in financing activities was $282 million and $147 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.61American’s principal financing activities in 2019 included $3.4 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $2.1 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the prepayment of $1.3 billion of secured loans. These cash outflows were offset in part by $3.2 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt for equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and other flight equipment.American’s principal financing activities in 2018 included $2.4 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $1.9 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the prepayment of $513 million of secured loans. These cash outflows were offset by $2.4 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, consisting of $1.9 billion in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and pre-delivery purchase deposits, as well as an incremental $500 million on a term loan facility.CommitmentsFor further information regarding our commitments, see the Notes to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and the Notes to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B at the referenced footnotes below. AAG AmericanLong-term debt and debt covenantsNote 5 Note 3LeasesNote 6 Note 4Employee benefit plansNote 10 Note 8Commitments, contingencies and guaranteesNote 12 Note 10Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Pass-Through TrustsAmerican currently operates 382 owned aircraft and 69 leased aircraft, and owns 79 spare aircraft engines, which in each case were financed with EETCs issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment or to permit issuance of debt backed by existing flight equipment. In the case of aircraft EETCs, rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. Similarly, in the case of the spare engine EETCs, the trusts allow American to use its existing pool of spare engines to raise financing under a single facility. The trusts have also been structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.Each trust covers a set number of aircraft or spare engines scheduled to be delivered, financed or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft or spare engine financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft or engines. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or spare engines or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft or engines, as applicable. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2019, $11.9 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.62With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities; however, American concluded it is not the primary beneficiary under these leasing arrangements and accounts for the majority of its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future payments to the trusts of each of the relevant EETCs under these leveraged lease financings are $177 million as of December 31, 2019. Letters of Credit and OtherWe provide financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or restricted cash and investments, primarily to support projected workers’ compensation obligations and airport commitments. As of December 31, 2019, we had $572 million of letters of credit and surety bonds securing various obligations. The letters of credit and surety bonds that are subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2022.Contractual ObligationsThe following table provides details of our future cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019. Except to the extent set forth in the applicable accompanying footnotes, this table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time.

(e) See Part I, Item 2. Properties – “Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments” for additional information about the firm commitment aircraft delivery schedule, in particular the footnotes to the table thereunder as to potential changes to such delivery schedule. Due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of delivery of certain aircraft, the amounts in the table represent our current best estimate, including with respect to the delivery of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft; however, the actual delivery schedule may differ from the table above, potentially materially. Additionally, the amounts in the table exclude 22 787-8 aircraft to be delivered in 2020 and 2021 for which Boeing has committed to provide sale-leaseback financing (in the form of operating leases). This financing is reflected in the operating lease commitments line above. (f) Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially. Rental payments under operating leases for certain aircraft flown under these capacity purchase agreements are reflected in the operating lease commitments line above.(g) Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and is based on estimated payments through 2029.(h) Includes purchase commitments for aircraft fuel, construction projects and information technology support.Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible ActionsIn light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new flight equipment, the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, and future pension funding obligations, we and our subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks, natural disasters or other causes could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our financing arrangements.In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.Our Board of Directors has from time to time authorized programs to repurchase shares of our common stock, one of which is currently in effect, and may authorize additional share repurchase programs in the future.OTHER INFORMATIONBasis of PresentationSee Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding the basis of presentation.64Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See the “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.Passenger RevenueWe recognize all revenues generated from transportation on American and our regional flights operated under the brand name American Eagle, including associated baggage fees, ticketing change fees and other inflight services, as passenger revenue when transportation is provided. Ticket and other related sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines, as well as estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel. The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed. Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.Loyalty RevenueWe currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American and other participating partner airlines, as well as other non-air travel awards such as hotels and rental cars. For mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members, we apply the deferred revenue method.Mileage credits earned through travelFor mileage credits earned through travel, we apply a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each passenger ticket sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. The estimated selling price of mileage credits is determined using an equivalent ticket value approach, which uses historical data, including award redemption patterns by geographic region and class of service, as well as similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions. The estimated selling price of miles is adjusted for an estimate of miles that will not be redeemed based on historical redemption patterns. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10% increase in the estimated selling price of miles would have decreased revenues by approximately $135 million as a result of additional amounts deferred from passenger ticket sales to be recognized in future periods. 65Mileage credits sold to co-branded credit cards and other partners We sell mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners, including our co-branded credit card partners, under contracts with terms extending generally for one to seven years. Consideration received from the sale of mileage credits is variable and payment terms typically are within 30 days subsequent to the month of mileage sale. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners are comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. We allocate the consideration received from these sales of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.Our most significant partner agreements are our co-branded credit card agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US that we entered into in 2016. We identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; and the use of intellectual property, including the American brand and access to loyalty program member lists, which is the predominant element in the agreements, as well as advertising (collectively, the marketing component). Accordingly, we recognize the marketing component in other revenue in the period of the mileage sale following the sales-based royalty method.The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using the same equivalent ticket value approach described above. The portion of each mileage credit sold attributable to transportation is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided.For the portion of our outstanding mileage credits that we estimate will not be redeemed, we recognize the associated value proportionally as the remaining mileage credits are redeemed. Our estimates are based on analysis of historical redemptions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of miles not expected to be redeemed would have increased revenues by approximately $95 million.Cargo RevenueCargo revenue is recognized when we provide the transportation.Other RevenueOther revenue includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, which is comprised principally of the marketing component of mileage sales to co-branded credit card and other partners and other marketing related payments. The accounting and recognition for the loyalty program marketing services are discussed above in “Loyalty Revenue.” The remaining amounts included within other revenue relate to airport clubs, advertising and vacation-related services.Long-lived AssetsLong-lived assets consist of flight equipment, as well as other fixed assets and definite-lived intangible assets such as certain domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements, tradenames and airport gate leasehold rights. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Definite-lived intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.We assess impairment of long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.The majority of American’s aircraft fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan. 66Goodwill and Indefinite-lived AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment annually on October 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have one consolidated reporting unit.Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain domestic airport slots and international slots and route authorities. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are assessed for impairment annually on October 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment. Under the qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors, among others, to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining per mile passenger yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5) changes to the regulatory environment.Based upon our annual assessment, there were no impairments of our goodwill and no material impairments of our indefinite-lived assets in 2019.Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement BenefitsWe recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).Our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (1) discount rate, (2) expected return on plan assets and (3) expected health care cost trend rate (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were: 2019 2018Pension weighted average discount rate (1)3.4% 4.4%Retiree medical and other postretirement benefits weighted average discount rate (1)3.3% 4.3%Expected rate of return on plan assets (2)8.0% 8.0%Weighted average health care cost trend rate assumed for next year (3): Initial3.7% 3.9%Ultimate (2027)3.3% 3.5% (1) When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2019 would increase our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $1.3 billion and $40 million, respectively, decrease estimated 2020 pension expense by approximately $5 million and increase estimated 2020 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by less than $1 million.(2) The expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 26% U.S. stocks, 16% developed international stocks, 30% fixed income securities, 20% alternative (private) investments and 8% emerging market stocks. The expected rate of return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2019 would increase estimated 2020 pension expense and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $65 million and $1 million, respectively.(3) The assumed health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points would increase estimated 2020 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $5 million.67During 2019, we reviewed and revised certain economic and demographic assumptions including the pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits discount rates and health care cost trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension plans resulted in an increase of $2.1 billion in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2019. The net effect of changing these assumptions for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans resulted in an increase of $71 million in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2019. We also revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new Pri-2012 mortality tables and improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries. This resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans of $127 million and $11 million, respectively.See Note 10 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 8 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding our employee benefit plans.Recent Accounting PronouncementASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)This ASU requires the use of an expected loss model for certain types of financial instruments and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates. For trade receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is required. For available-for-sale debt securities, an allowance for credit losses will be required rather than a reduction to the carrying value of the asset. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. While we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of adoption of this standard, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. See Note 8 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 6 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion regarding risk management matters.Aircraft FuelOur operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of fuel can have a material effect on our costs and liquidity. Market prices for aircraft fuel can be volatile, with market spot prices ranging from a low of approximately $1.24 per gallon to a high of approximately $2.35 per gallon during the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019.As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Based on our 2020 forecasted fuel consumption, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the price of aircraft fuel would increase our 2020 annual fuel expense by $47 million.Foreign CurrencyWe are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated transactions. Our largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program. We estimate a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from 2019 levels relative to each of the currencies in which we have foreign currency exposure would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.68Generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control” for additional discussion of this and other currency risks.InterestOur earnings and cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments and our interest income from short-term, interest bearing investments.Our largest exposure with respect to variable-rate debt comes from changes in LIBOR. We had variable-rate debt instruments representing approximately 40% of our total long-term debt at December 31, 2019. We currently do not have an interest rate hedge program to hedge our exposure to floating interest rates on our variable-rate debt obligations. If annual interest rates increase 100 basis points, based on our December 31, 2019 variable-rate debt and short-term investments balances, annual interest expense on variable-rate debt would increase by approximately $95 million and annual interest income on short-term investments would increase by approximately $40 million. Additionally, the fair value of fixed-rate debt would have decreased by approximately $600 million for AAG and $580 million for American.On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, or what effect these changes in views or alternatives may have on financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities, we cannot currently predict whether this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere.We may in the future pursue amendments to our LIBOR-based debt transactions to provide for a transaction mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments. As of December 31, 2019, we had $9.6 billion of borrowings based on LIBOR. The replacement of LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.69\""

(AAG) a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are American, a Delaware corporation, and, as of December 9, 2013, US Airways Group, a Delaware corporation. AAG was formed in 1982 under the name AMR Corporation (AMR) as the parent company of American which was founded in 1934. US Airways Group was formed in 1982 and its origins trace back to the formation of All American Aviation in 1939. AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. on December 9, 2013. Virtually all of AAG\\'s operations fall within the airline industry.AAG\\'s and American\\'s principal executive offices are located at 4333 Amon Carter Boulevard, Fort Worth, Texas 76155. AAG\\'s and American\\'s telephone number is 817-967-1234 and their Internet address is www.aa.com. Information contained on AAG\\'s website is not and should not be deemed a part of this report or any other report or filing filed with or furnished to the SEC.Chapter 11 ReorganizationOn November 29, 2011 (the Petition Date), AMR Corporation (referred to as AMR prior to December 9, 2013), its principal subsidiary, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors), filed voluntary petitions for relief (the Chapter 11 Cases) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order) approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan).On December 9, 2013 (the Effective Date), the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the Merger Agreement), dated as of February 13, 2013, by and among AMR, AMR Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub) and US Airways Group, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group (the Merger), with US Airways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR following the Merger. As noted above, immediately following the Merger closing, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc.As previously reported, in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, trading in AMR’s common stock and certain debt securities on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was suspended on January 5, 2012, and AMR’s common stock and such debt securities were delisted by the SEC from the NYSE on January 30, 2012. On January 5, 2012, AMR’s common stock began trading under the symbol \"AAMRQ\" (CUSIP 001765106) on the OTCQB marketplace, operated by OTC Markets Group. Pursuant to the Plan, and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, on the Effective Date (i) all existing shares of AAG’s old common stock formerly traded under the symbol \"AAMRQ\" were canceled and (ii) the Company was authorized to issue up to approximately 544 million shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AAG (AAG Common Stock) by operation of the Plan (excluding shares of AAG Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement). On the Effective Date, the AAG Common Stock was listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"AAL\" and AAMRQ ceased trading on the OTCQB marketplace. In addition, AAG’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 (the AAG Series A Preferred Stock), was authorized for trading and listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"AALCP.\" Upon emergence from Chapter 11, the Company issued approximately 53 million shares of AAG Common Stock to the Company’s old equity holders and certain of the Debtors’ employees and 168 million shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock, which is mandatorily convertible into new AAG Common Stock during the 120-day period after the Effective Date, to certain creditors and employees of the Debtors (including shares deposited in the Disputed Claims Reserve (as defined in the Plan)). Holders of AAMRQ received, for each share of AMR common stock, an initial distribution of approximately 0.0665 shares of the AAG Common Stock in connection with the occurrence of the Effective Date. AAMRQ holders, and those deemed to be treated as such in connection with the elections made pursuant to the Plan, have received and may continue to receive additional distributions of shares of AAG Common Stock based on the trading price of AAG Common Stock during the 120 day period after the Effective Date and the total amount of allowed claims, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. On the Effective Date, the adjusted total Double-Dip General Unsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan) was approximately $2.45 billion, the Allowed Single-Dip General Unsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan) were approximately $2.45 billion and the Disputed Claims Reserve (as defined in the Plan) was approximately $755 million.5During its Chapter 11 restructuring, AMR and the other Debtors took numerous steps to become more cost competitive in the airline industry. These measures included steps to realize labor cost savings and improve managerial efficiencies, to reconfigure their fleet, and to realize other economies. Through the process under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code and consensual negotiations with its labor unions, American and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle) entered into new restructured collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with each of their respective union groups. The Debtors also froze their four defined benefit pension plans, and terminated the pilot variable income retirement plan, putting in their place a revised defined contribution retirement benefit plan. The Debtors also amended the pilots’ defined benefit pension plan to eliminate lump-sum and similar installment forms of benefit payments from such plan.The Debtors also took significant actions to reduce non-labor related liabilities on their balance sheets. Specifically, the Debtors rejected or renegotiated financing on more than 400 aircraft, and evaluated and/or renegotiated over 700 real estate leases and over 9,000 vendor contracts. Importantly, during their restructuring, the Debtors successfully implemented their fleet renewal strategy. The Debtors evaluated their fleet based on then-current rates and market values, required maintenance, and the need to phase out older aircraft to achieve necessary fleet efficiencies.See Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Stock And Related Stockholder Matters, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Note 2 and Note 4 to AAG\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8A and Note 2 to American\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8B for further information regarding the Chapter 11 Cases and the Merger.MergerPursuant to the Merger Agreement and consistent with the Plan, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of US Airways Group was converted into the right to receive one share of AAG Common Stock. The aggregate number of shares of AAG Common Stock issuable in the Merger to holders of US Airways Group equity instruments (including stockholders, holders of convertible notes, optionees, and holders of restricted stock units (RSUs)) represented 28% of the diluted equity ownership of AAG. The remaining 72% diluted equity ownership in AAG (up to approximately 544 million shares) is distributable, pursuant to the Plan (see \"Chapter 11 - Emergence\" above) to stakeholders, labor unions, and certain employees of AMR and the other Debtors and such 72% of the diluted equity ownership of AAG includes all shares of AAG Common Stock that are or may become issuable upon conversion of shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock such that the aggregate number of shares of AAG Common Stock issuable under the Plan will not exceed 72% of the diluted equity ownership of AAG as of the time of the Merger.In connection with the completion of the Merger, the NYSE suspended trading in the US Airways Group common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the US Airways Group Common Stock), prior to the opening of the market on December 9, 2013. The NYSE also filed with the SEC a Form 25 Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, to delist the US Airways Group Common Stock from the NYSE and terminate registration of the US Airways Group Common Stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the Plan, as of the Effective Date, the board of directors of AAG was reconstituted to be comprised of 12 members: (i) Thomas W. Horton, AMR’s prior chairman, chief executive officer and president, who currently serves as chairman of AAG and will continue to so serve until the earlier of one year after the closing of the Merger and the day immediately prior to the first annual meeting of stockholders of AAG (provided that such meeting will not occur prior to May 1, 2014), (ii) W. Douglas Parker, formerly chief executive officer of US Airways, Inc., who serves as chief executive officer of AAG and will serve as chairman of AAG following the end of Mr. Horton’s term, (iii) two independent directors designated by AMR, Alberto Ibargüen and Ray M. Robinson, (iv) three independent directors designated by US Airways Group, Matthew J. Hart, Richard C. Kraemer, and Denise M. O’Leary, and (v) five independent directors, James F. Albaugh, Jeffrey D. Benjamin, John T. Cahill (lead independent director), Michael J. Embler, and Richard P. Schifter, who were designated by a search committee consisting of representatives of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of the Debtors and certain representatives of creditors signatory to support agreements with AMR.Further, on the Effective Date, Mr. Horton (formerly president and chief executive officer), Daniel P. Garton (formerly executive vice president), Isabella D. Goren (formerly senior vice president and chief financial officer), Gary F. Kennedy (formerly senior vice president, general counsel, and chief compliance officer) and James B. Ream (formerly senior vice president of operations) ceased to be executive officers of AAG and American and W. Douglas Parker (chief executive officer of AAG, American, and US Airways Group), J. Scott Kirby (president), Derek J. Kerr (executive vice president and chief financial officer), Robert D. Isom, Jr. (chief operating officer and chief executive officer of US Airways), Elise R. Eberwein (executive vice president - people and communications) and Stephen L. Johnson (executive vice president-corporate affairs) were elected as the executive officers of AAG, American, US Airways Group and US Airways, except as otherwise noted.On the Effective Date and pursuant to the Plan and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, AAG’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws were amended and restated in their entirety, and an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 6(the Certificate of Incorporation) and a Certificate of Designations with respect to the AAG Series A Preferred Stock was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware immediately prior to the closing of the Merger. Upon issuance of the shares pursuant to the Plan and the Merger Agreement, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with Secretary of State of the State of Delaware solely to change its name to American Airlines Group Inc. Thereafter, the Company filed a Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which integrated the Certificate of Incorporation (including the Certificate of Designations) and the Certificate of Amendment, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.The Merger was intended to qualify, for federal income tax purposes, as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.The Merger has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with AAG treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. US Airways Group’s identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their estimated fair values as of the Effective Date. Goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the Merger over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually.See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \"AAG Year in Review\", Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \"AAG Results of Operations\", Note 2 and Note 4 to AAG\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8A and Note 2 to American\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8B for further information regarding the Chapter 11 Cases and the Merger.Airline OperationsAs noted above, AAG is a holding company whose primary business activity is the operation of two major network carriers through its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries: American and, as of December 9, 2013, US Airways. As of December 31, 2013, American, together with American Eagle and the third-party regional carriers that provide regional feed to American, served more than 270 communities in more than 50 countries using a combined network fleet of 903 aircraft. American is a founding member of oneworld® alliance and is one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world, providing a wide range of freight and mail services to shippers throughout its system onboard its passenger fleet. American had approximately 87 million passengers boarding its mainline flights in 2013.US Airways Group is a holding company whose wholly-owned subsidiaries include US Airways, Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (Piedmont) and PSA Airlines, Inc. (PSA). As of December 31, 2013, those carriers and the third-party regional carriers that provide regional feed to US Airways served more than 207 airports in more than 20 countries using a combined network fleet of 621 aircraft. Following the Merger, AAG began moving toward operating under the single brand name of \"American Airlines\" through its mainline operations, American and US Airways. Until a single operating certificate is issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the operational integration is complete, American and US Airways will continue to operate as separate airlines. This process is expected to take 18-24 months. Through its operating subsidiaries, including the operating subsidiaries of US Airways Group, AAG is the largest airline in the world as measured by revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and available seat miles (ASMs). The Company has primary hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. As of December 31, 2013, the combined airline, together with its third-party regional carriers operated nearly 6,700 daily flights to 339 destinations in 54 countries. As of December 31, 2013, American and US Airways operated 965 mainline jets. American continues to be provided with regional feed by American Eagle and third-party regional carriers and US Airways continues to be provided with regional feed by Piedmont, PSA and third-party regional carriers. As of December 31, 2013, the Company\\'s regional subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers that provide it with regional feed operated approximately 519 regional jets and approximately 40 turboprops.See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \"Results of Operations\" for a discussion of AAG’s and American’s operating results and operating performance. See Note 15 to AAG\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 14 to American\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our operating segments and operating revenue in principal geographic areas.Regional OperationsCertain air carriers, including our wholly-owned regional carriers, American Eagle, Piedmont and PSA, and third-party regional carriers, have arrangements with us to provide regional feed under the trade name \"American Eagle\" or \"US Airways Express.\" As of December 31, 2013, 15 regional aircraft were also provided by a third party operating under the \"American Connection\" brand, an arrangement that we expect to end during 2014. American Eagle and US Airways Express carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on feeder traffic from these regional carriers, which carry passengers to our hubs from low-density markets that are uneconomical for us to serve with large jets. In addition, regional carriers offer 7complementary service in our existing mainline markets by operating flights during off-peak periods between mainline flights. During 2013, approximately 22 million passengers boarded our regional, air carriers\\' planes, approximately 43% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. Of these passengers, approximately 18 million were enplaned by our wholly owned regional carriers, approximately 4 million were enplaned by third-party regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements and less than 1 million were enplaned by carriers operating under prorate agreements, as described below. The American Eagle and US Airways Express arrangements are principally in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, mail and freight revenues, go to us. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees and passenger liability insurance, will be reimbursed 100% by us. We control marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. A very small number of regional aircraft are operated for us under prorate agreements, under which the regional carriers receive a prorated share of ticket revenue and pay certain service fees to us. The prorate carriers are responsible for all costs incurred operating the applicable aircraft. All American Eagle and US Airways Express carriers have logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to our mainline operations. CargoOur cargo division is one of the largest air cargo operations in the world, with facilities and interline connections available across the globe. Other revenuesOther revenues include revenue from the marketing services related to the sale of mileage credits in the AAdvantage and Dividend Miles programs as discussed below under \"Frequent Flyer Program\", membership fees and related revenue from our Admirals Club operations, our US Airways Club operations, and other miscellaneous service revenue, including administrative service charges and baggage handling fees.The U.S. Airline IndustryIn 2013, the U.S. airline industry experienced year-over-year growth in passenger revenues driven by strong demand for air travel. In its most recent data available, Airlines for America, the trade association for U.S. airlines, reported that annual U.S. industry passenger revenues and yields increased 3.8% and 2.0%, respectively, as compared to 2012. With respect to international versus domestic performance, Airlines for America reported that the Atlantic and Latin America markets outperformed domestic markets in year-over-year growth in passenger revenues while the Pacific market experienced year-over-year declines in passenger revenues. Throughout 2013, jet fuel prices continued to follow the price of Brent crude oil more closely than the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. On average, fuel costs were down slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012. The Brent crude oil average daily spot price was $109 per barrel in 2013 which is slightly lower than the average daily spot price in 2012 of $112 per barrel. However, on a daily basis, prices continued to be volatile. Throughout 2013, daily spot prices fluctuated between a high of $119 per barrel in February to a low of $97 per barrel in April and closed the year at $110 per barrel on December 31, 2013. While the U.S. airline industry is currently benefiting from a favorable revenue environment and moderating fuel price increases as described above, uncertainty exists regarding the economic conditions driving these factors. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.\"CompetitionThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Domestically, any U.S. airline deemed fit by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its possessions, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations and other facilities (Slots). Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target promotions and frequent flyer initiatives. On most of our domestic non-stop routes, we currently face competing service from at least one, and sometimes more than one, domestic airline, including: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin America. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition, we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines operating point-to-point service on such routes. 8We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation.On all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other airlines. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slack travel periods, when they begin service to new cities or when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow and maximize revenue per ASM and to establish, increase or preserve market share. Discount and promotional fares are generally non-refundable and may be subject to various restrictions such as minimum stay requirements, advance ticketing, limited seating and change fees. We have often elected to match discount or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. Most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market. Our ability to compete on the basis of price is limited by our fixed costs and depends on our ability to manage effectively our operating costs. Some of our competitors have greater financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than we do. In addition, low fare, low-cost carriers compete in many of the markets in which we operate and competition from these carriers is increasing. These low cost carriers generally have lower cost structures than American and US Airways.In addition to price competition, airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle and US Airways Express regional carriers increase the number of markets the Company serves by flying to lower demand markets and providing connections at our hubs. Many of the Company’s competitors also own or have marketing agreements with regional airlines which provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times), availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to passengers, frequent flyer programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products, markets served and other services. We compete with both major network airlines and low-cost airlines throughout our network.In addition to our extensive domestic service, we provide international service to Canada, Mexico, Europe, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Asia. Revenues from foreign operations (flights serving international destinations) were approximately 40% of American’s total operating revenues and approximately 24% of US Airways’ total operating revenues for 2013. In providing international air transportation, we compete with foreign investor-owned airlines, foreign state-owned airlines, and U.S. airlines that have been granted authority to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations.Marketing and Alliance Agreements with Other AirlinesIn general, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets beyond the nonstop city pair have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers\\' rights to carry passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. To improve access to each other\\'s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers - including American and US Airways - have established marketing relationships with other airlines and rail companies. American currently has marketing relationships with Air Berlin, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cape Air, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, EL AL, Etihad Airways, Fiji Airways, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hainan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Jet Airways, JetStar Airways, LAN (includes LAN Airlines, LAN Argentina, LAN Colombia, LAN Ecuador and LAN Peru), Malaysia Airlines, Niki Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Seaborne Airlines, TAM Airlines, and WestJet.American is also a founding member of the oneworld alliance, which includes AirBerlin, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LAN Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, and S7 Airlines. TAM Airlines and SriLankan Airlines are scheduled to join the alliance in the first half of 2014. The oneworld alliance links the networks of the member carriers to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers\\' frequent flyer programs and access to the carriers\\' airport lounge facilities. Together, oneworld members and members-elect serve 981 destinations with over 14,000 daily flights to 151 countries.American is party to antitrust-immunized cooperation agreements with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, and Royal Jordanian. Over the last three years, American has also established joint business agreements (JBAs) with British Airways, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Qantas and Finnair that enable the carriers to cooperate on flights between particular destinations, and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced frequent flyer program reciprocity, and cooperation in other areas. American and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into these JBAs. In addition, in December 2012, American signed codeshare agreements with Sao Paulo-based TAM Airlines and Bogota-based LAN Colombia. Generally, under a codeshare arrangement, one carrier places its designator code and sells ticket on flights of another carrier. Once approved in Brazil and Colombia, respectively, these new codeshare relationships will provide expanded opportunities for American to serve new markets in Brazil and Colombia and for TAM Airlines and LAN Colombia to serve new markets in the U.S.US Airways is currently a member of the Star Alliance®, which offers similar member benefits as those discussed above for the oneworld alliance, and will transition to oneworld on March 31, 2014. As part of this transition, codeshare and frequent 9flyer reciprocity between US Airways and many members of the Star Alliance will be ending on March 30, 2014. Some of the largest airlines that will be phased out at that time include United Airlines, Lufthansa, Swiss, Brussels Airlines, and All Nippon Airways, while others will be phased out in the following months. We are in negotiations with International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, concerning the terms by which flights operated by US Airways will be added to our existing transatlantic joint business. We have thus far been unable to reach agreement with IAG and are uncertain if we will be able to reach an agreement. US Airways’ entry into the JBA and cooperation with other carriers is subject to compliance with all DOT regulations and applicable orders as well as obtaining required DOT approvals. US Airways is expected to enter into codeshare cooperation with selected oneworld member airlines and frequent flyer reciprocity with all other members. US Airways is also expected to enter into marketing relationships with selected other airlines that are currently party to marketing agreements with American.Industry Regulation and Airport AccessGeneralOur airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation. However, DOT and the FAA still exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers. DOT maintains jurisdiction over the approval of domestic and international codeshare agreements, international route authorities, and consumer protection and competition matters, such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. The FAA regulates flying operations, primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance, and other operational and safety areas. Pursuant to these regulations, our airline subsidiaries have FAA-approved maintenance programs for each type of aircraft they operate. The programs provide for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from periodic routine inspections to major overhauls. FAA requirements cover, among other things, retirement and maintenance of older aircraft, safety measures, collision avoidance systems, airborne windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement, other environmental concerns, fuel tank inerting, crew scheduling and aircraft operations. We are also progressing toward the completion of numerous airworthiness directives, a number of which require us to perform significant maintenance work and to incur additional expenses. Based on the current implementation schedule, we expect to be in full compliance with the applicable requirements within the required time periods. Our failure to timely comply with these requirements has in the past and could in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. The FAA also operates the air traffic control (ATC) system in the United States.Additionally, the FAA recently implemented rules on pilot flight and duty times, and finalized rules on minimum requirements for all pilots operating commercial aircraft. Both rules have increased our costs and reduced staffing flexibility, particularly during irregular operations. We are also working with the FAA on integrating US Airways and American into a single operating certificate under the American operations specifications.Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the \"ticket tax,\" on domestic and international air transportation. Airlines collect the ticket tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation, and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although these taxes are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. See \"Industry Regulation and Airport Access - Security,\" below for a discussion of passenger fees.Most major U.S. airports impose a passenger facility charge (PFC). The ability of airports to increase this charge (and the ability of airlines to contest such increases) is restricted by federal legislation, DOT regulations and judicial decisions. With certain exceptions, air carriers pass these charges on to passengers. However, our ability to pass through the total amount of the PFC to our customers is subject to various factors, including market conditions and competitive factors. The current cap on the PFC is $4.50 per passenger, but the industry has faced repeated efforts in Congress to raise the cap to a higher level including in the last session of Congress.DOT consumer rules that took effect in 2010 require procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, including additional reporting requirements for airlines, that have increased the cost of airline operations and reduced revenues. The DOT has been aggressively investigating alleged violations of these rules. In addition, the DOT finalized a second set of rules that further regulate airline interactions with passengers through the reservations process, at the airport and on board the aircraft. These rules require airlines to display all fares in an \"all in\" basis, with the price of the air travel and all taxes and government imposed fees rolled into the displayed fare. Enhanced disclosure of ancillary fees such as baggage fees is also required. Other rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international carriers.We anticipate a third set of consumer rules to be issued by the DOT in 2014 and the DOT continues its efforts to further regulate airlines through increased data reporting requirements, expansion of the Air Carrier Access Act, and greater oversight 10of the methods airlines use to describe and sell air transportation and other products and services. Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to our operation. In this environment, no assurance can be given that compliance with these new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight from the DOJ, the FAA or other regulatory bodies will not have a material adverse effect on our business.Among its regulatory responsibilities, DOT also enforces equal access to air transportation for disabled passengers. Recently, a number of carriers, including American and US Airways, have entered into consent orders with DOT over their handling of disabled passengers. DOT has been aggressive in prosecuting disability violations and seeks large penalties. We expect to see continued DOT emphasis in this area through both regulation and enforcement. DOT and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and CBAs. In addition, as a result of heightened levels of concern regarding data privacy, we are subject to an increasing number of domestic and foreign laws regarding the privacy and security of passenger and employee data.International International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. Our operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or governmental authorities, such as the European Union (EU), and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral and multilateral agreements among the U.S. and various foreign governments of countries we serve are periodically subject to renegotiation. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, Slots or other assets located abroad, or otherwise adversely affect our international operations. The open skies agreement between the U.S. and Brazil, which was signed in 2010 and takes full effect in 2015, has resulted in increased competition in the U.S./Brazil market. In addition, at some foreign airports, an air carrier needs Slots and other facilities before the air carrier can introduce new service or increase existing service. The availability of such Slots is not assured and our inability to obtain and retain needed Slots and facilities could therefore inhibit our efforts to compete in certain international markets. Further, pursuant to the Merger clearance process in the EU, we are required to make available to other carriers certain Slots at London Heathrow. See \"Industry Regulation and Airport Access - Airport Access and Operations,\" below.Security The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the Aviation Security Act) was enacted in November 2001. Under the Aviation Security Act, substantially all aspects of civil aviation security screening were federalized, and a new Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the DOT was created. The TSA was then transferred to the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Aviation Security Act, among other matters, mandates improved flight deck security; carriage at no charge of federal air marshals; enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors; enhanced security training; fingerprint-based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports pursuant to regulations issued in connection with the Aviation Security Act; and the provision of certain passenger data to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Funding for the TSA is provided by a combination of air carrier fees, passenger fees and taxpayer monies. A \"passenger security fee,\" which is collected by air carriers from their passengers, is currently set at a rate of $2.50 per flight segment but not more than $10 per round trip. However, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 increased the passenger security fee to $5.60 per one-way trip effective on July 1, 2014. An air carrier fee, or Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee (ASIF), has also been imposed with an annual cap equivalent to the amount that an individual air carrier paid in calendar year 2000 for the screening of passengers and property. The fee was repealed by federal legislation and the repeal will go into effect on October 1, 2014. Implementation of and compliance with the requirements of the Aviation Security Act have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs for us and our passengers and have resulted and will likely continue to result in service disruptions and delays. As a result of competitive pressure, we and other airlines may be unable to recover all of these additional security costs from passengers through increased fares. In addition, we cannot forecast what new security and safety requirements may be imposed in the future or the costs or financial impact of complying with any such requirements.11Airline Fares Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve. While air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions, fare overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets.Airport Access and OperationsOperations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports we serve are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of Slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each Slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period.In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of Slots, Slot exemptions, operating authorizations, or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at Reagan National in Washington, D.C., LaGuardia and JFK in New York City, and Newark. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of Slots or analogous regulatory authorities. Similarly, our operations at Frankfurt, London Heathrow, Paris, Tokyo Narita and certain other international airports are regulated by local Slot coordinators pursuant to the International Air Transport Association’s Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines (WSG) and applicable local law. We currently have sufficient Slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights, and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are often sought after by other airlines, and are subject to changes in governmental policies. In connection with the settlement of antitrust litigation brought by the DOJ and certain states, we entered into settlement agreements that provide for certain asset divestitures. In the agreement with the United States government, among other things, we agreed to divest and not reacquire for ten years certain rights and assets consisting of 52 Slot pairs at Washington Reagan National Airport and 17 Slot pairs at LaGuardia, in each case together with associated gates and related ground facilities necessary to operate those Slot pairs, and two gates at each of Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International Airport. The agreement with the plaintiff states requires our airlines, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, to maintain certain hub operations in a manner generally consistent with historical operations and to continue to provide scheduled daily service to certain specified communities, both for limited periods of time. In addition, we entered into a related settlement with the DOT related to small community service from Washington Reagan National Airport. Further, as a consequence of the Merger clearance process in the EU, we are required to make available one pair of London Heathrow Slots for use by another carrier between London and Philadelphia, which the acquiring carrier can deploy on another Heathrow city pair after operating the Slots on London-Philadelphia for a period of not less than three consecutive years, and, along with our JBA partners, we are required to make available for an initial period of up to seven years one pair of Heathrow Slots for service between London and Miami that may be operated via an intermediate point.Amendments to the Wright Amendment have reduced geographic restrictions on operations at Dallas Love Field (DAL) and in October 2014, will eliminate all such domestic non-stop geographic restrictions on operations there. Southwest has already announced plans to serve new markets throughout the continental United States from DAL in October 2014. Although we held two gates at DAL, we did not operate from there in 2013 and instead operated solely at Dallas Fort Worth. An element of our settlement of the antitrust litigation brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and certain states relating to the Merger included our divestiture of the two gates we held at DAL. The DOT allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems, provided such procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. Certain locales, including Boston, Washington D.C., Chicago, San Diego and San Francisco, among others, have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of these operations. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs, and these restrictions could limit the ability of our airline subsidiaries to expand their operations at the affected airports. Authorities at other airports may adopt similar noise regulations. See \"Industry Regulation and Airport Access - Environmental Matters,\" below.Civil Reserve Air FleetWe are a participant in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, which is a voluntary program administered by the U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command. The General Services Administration of the U.S. Government requires that airlines participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program in order to receive U.S. Government business. We are reimbursed at compensatory rates if aircraft are activated under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program or when participating in Department of 12Defense business. If a substantial number of our aircraft are activated for operation under the CRAF program at a time of war or other national emergency, our business operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In January 2014, the U.S. Air Force proposed a radical restructuring of the CRAF program to take effect in October 2015. We do not support the new proposals as they could adversely affect our business and, together with other industry participants, we are working with the Air Force to address our concerns.Environmental Matters The airline industry is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund Act). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.The ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The ANCA generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, our operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.Many aspects of the Company\\'s operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, in particular, may result in the imposition of additional international and domestic legislation or regulation. For example, the EU has established the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in the EU. The EU adopted a directive under which each EU member state is required to extend the ETS to aviation operations. This directive would have required us, beginning in 2012, in order to operate flights to and from airports in the European Economic Area (EEA), including flights between the U.S. and EU member states, to annually submit emission allowances equal to our total carbon dioxide emissions from those flights. While a certain portion of those allowances are granted to us at no cost, we may potentially need to also purchase allowances in order to cover our emissions total in a given year. However, in an effort to allow ICAO time to propose an alternate scheme to manage global aviation emissions, in April 2013 the EU suspended for one year the ETS\\' application to flights entering and departing the EEA, limiting its application, for flights flown in 2012, to intra-EEA flights only. In October 2013, the ICAO Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the development through ICAO of a global, market-based scheme for aviation emissions, to be implemented in 2020. Subsequently, the EU has proposed amending the EU ETS so that the monitoring, reporting and submission of allowances for emissions from flights flown in 2013 would continue to be limited to only intra-EEA flights. For flights flown from 2014 to 2020, the scope of coverage under the amendment would include intra-EEA flights and the portion of aviation emissions of flights to and from EU member states that take place in European regional airspace. The EU anticipates approval of this amendment in April 2014. The U.S. enacted legislation in November 2012 which encourages the DOT to seek an international solution through ICAO and that will allow the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the ETS. While these measures create some uncertainty as to the extent to which we will be required to participate in the ETS going forward, it is nevertheless increasingly likely that in the future we will be required to participate in some form of international arrangement governing aircraft emissions. In addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation on climate change. Although Congress has not passed comprehensive climate change legislation, several states have adopted mechanisms to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Even without further federal legislation, the EPA may act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In 2009, the EPA issued its final Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases, which became effective in January 2010. This regulatory finding sets the foundation for potential future EPA greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act. Depending on the scope of such regulation, certain of our facilities and operations may be subject to additional operating and other permit requirements, potentially resulting in increased operating costs.The environmental laws to which we are subject include those related to responsibility for potential soil and groundwater contamination. We are conducting investigation and remediation activities to address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and maintenance bases. We anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. Our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of all PRPs; we anticipate that any future payments of costs at such sites will not have a material impact on our operations.13Future Regulatory Developments Future regulatory developments and actions could affect operations and increase operating costs for the airline industry, including our airline subsidiaries. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate Slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations,\" \"Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages\" and \"We are subject to many forms of environmental regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result\" for additional information.Employees and Labor RelationsThe airline business is labor intensive. In 2013, salaries, wages, and benefits were one of our largest expenses and represented approximately 22% of our operating expenses. The table below presents our approximate number of active full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2013.

Under the RLA, the National Mediation Board (NMB) is responsible for determining which union, if any, is designated to represent employees. In an airline merger, when different unions represent the employees at the merging carrier, a union may file an application with the NMB to represent the combined group of post-merger employees. The application is reviewed by the NMB which considers whether the operations of the merging carriers have been sufficiently integrated to constitute a single transportation system. After the integration process is found to have created a single transportation system, the NMB then conducts an investigation to determine which union, if any, is to be the representative of the post-merger employees. That union then negotiates a joint collective bargaining agreement (JCBA) covering the combined group of post-merger employees. While the passenger service employees at mainline American are not currently represented by any labor organization, the passenger service employees of mainline US Airways are represented by the Airline Employees Customer Service Association, CWA-IBT (CWA-IBT). When and if the CWA-IBT files a single transportation system application with the NMB, the union is expected to attempt to organize the passenger service employees of both mainline airlines. In the meantime, the US Airways passenger service employees will continue to be represented by the CWA-IBT, and the American passenger service employees will remain unrepresented for labor relations purposes. Most of the other mainline American ground employees are represented by the Transport Workers Union (TWU) and are covered by existing CBAs. Although those agreements will not become amendable until 2018, the TWU is required under the agreements to file a single transportation system application in order to represent the combined groups of mainline US Airways and mainline American employees. For the fleet service employees, the mechanic and related employees and the stores employees, the TWU may share post-merger representation rights with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). After the NMB has determined that a single transportation system exists and has certified a post-merger representative of the combined employee groups, the process for negotiating new JCBA covering the combined employee groups will commence. That process can take many months or even several years to complete.Under an agreement reached with the American mainline and the US Airways mainline pilots and a tentative agreement with the American and US Airways mainline flight attendants, a different approach will be used by us to reach JCBAs. The two pilot groups have agreed that, once a post-merger representative has been designated by the NMB, there will be a thirty-day negotiations period, and, if no agreement is reached, a panel of arbitrators will set the remaining terms of the JCBAs that will become amendable on December 31, 2018. The economic terms of the pilot JCBA established by the arbitration panel must conform with the contract that was reached with the two pilot groups. If the tentative agreement with the American mainline and US Airways mainline flight attendants is approved, negotiations over the terms of a JCBA will be conducted for up to 240 days. If no agreement can be reached, a panel of arbitrators will establish the unresolved terms of the JCBA, which is to be set based on economics comparable to those for flight attendants at other legacy airlines.The merger will have no impact on the CBAs that cover the employees of our wholly-owned subsidiary airlines which are not being merged (American Eagle, Piedmont and PSA). For those employees, the RLA provides that CBAs do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date.When a RLA CBA becomes amendable, if either party to the agreement wishes to modify its terms, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed under the RLA and as agreed by the parties. Under the RLA, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement is reached, either party may request the NMB to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months and even for several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare under the RLA at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to binding arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, an initial 30-day \"cooling off\" period commences. Following the conclusion of that 30-day \"cooling off\" period, if no agreement has been reached, \"self-help\" (as described below) can begin unless a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) is established. A PEB examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and (if no resolution is reached) is followed by another \"cooling off\" period of 30 days. At the end of a \"cooling off\" period (unless an agreement is reached, a PEB is established, or action is taken by Congress), the labor organization may exercise \"self-help,\" such as a strike, and the airline may resort to its own \"self-help,\" including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.The NMB is currently mediating negotiations with the IAM covering the mainline US Airways fleet service employees, the mechanic and related employees, and the store employees, and with the AFA covering the Piedmont flight attendants.For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.\"16Aircraft FuelOur operations and financial results are significantly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel. Based on our 2014 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that as of December 31, 2013, a $1 per barrel increase in the price of crude oil would increase our 2014 annual fuel expense by $104 million (excluding the effect of our hedges), and by $87 million (taking into account such hedges). The following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs, including taxes, for American, it\\'s third-party regional carriers and American Eagle, for 2011 through 2013. AAG\\'s consolidated fuel requirements in 2014 are expected to increase significantly to approximately 4.4 billion gallons as a result of a full year of US Airways operations.Year Gallons Consumed(in millions) Average CostPer Gallon Total Cost(in millions) Percent of Total Operating Expenses2011 2,756 $3.01 $8,304 33.2%2012 2,723 $3.20 $8,717 35.3%2013 2,806 $3.09 $8,959 35.3% Total fuel expenses for American Eagle and American\\'s third-party regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $946 million, respectively.In order to provide a measure of control over price and supply, we trade and ship fuel and maintain fuel storage facilities to support our flight operations. Prior to the Effective Date, we from time to time entered into hedging contracts, which consist primarily of call options, collars (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold put option) and call spreads (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold call option). Heating oil, jet fuel and crude oil are the primary underlying commodities in the hedge portfolio. Depending on movements in the price of fuel, our fuel hedging can result in gains or losses on its fuel hedges. For more discussion see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.\"As of January 2014, we had hedges covering approximately 19% of estimated consolidated AAG (including the estimated fuel requirements of US Airways) 2014 fuel requirements. The consumption hedged for 2014 is capped at an average price of approximately $2.91 per gallon of jet fuel. One percent of our estimated 2014 fuel requirement is hedged using call spreads with protection capped at an average price of approximately $3.18 per gallon of jet fuel. Eighteen percent of our estimated 2014 fuel requirement is hedged using collars with an average floor price of approximately $2.62 per gallon of jet fuel. The cap and floor prices exclude taxes and transportation costs. We have not entered into any fuel hedges since the Effective Date and our current policy is not to do so.See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7(A). Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Note 10 to AAG\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8A and Note 9 to American\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8B.Fuel prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years. We cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.\"Insurance We maintain insurance of the types that we believe are customary in the airline industry, including insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage, and all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft. Principal coverage includes liability for injury to members of the public, including passengers, damage to property of AAG, its subsidiaries and others, and loss of or damage to flight equipment, whether on the ground or in flight. We also maintain other types of insurance such as workers’ compensation and employer’s liability, with limits and deductibles that we believe are standard within the industry.Since September 11, 2001, we and other airlines have been unable to obtain coverage for liability to persons other than employees and passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events, which is called war risk coverage, at reasonable rates from the commercial insurance market. We, therefore, purchased our war risk coverage through a special program administered by the FAA, as have most other U.S. airlines. This program, which currently expires September 30, 2014, 17has been extended numerous times in the past. If this program were not to be extended, we would likely face a material increase in the cost of war risk coverage, and because of competitive pressures in the industry, our ability to pass this additional cost to passengers may be limited. In addition, we have obtained third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance through a special program administered by the FAA, resulting in lower premiums than if we had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market. If the federal insurance program terminates, we would likely face a material increase in the cost of war risk insurance. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact our operations and financial results.\"In addition, insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in general following September 11, 2001. While the price of commercial insurance has declined since the period immediately after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, if commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to the Company or significantly increase its cost, the Company would be materially adversely affected.Customer ServiceWe are committed to consistently deliver safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our operation. Our 2013 operating performance was negatively impacted by more severe summer weather conditions as compared to 2012. We reported the following operating statistics to the DOT for American\\'s mainline operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: 2013 2012 Better (Worse)On-time performance (a)77.6% 76.9% 0.7 ptsCompletion factor (b)98.2% 98.2% —Mishandled baggage (c)3.02 2.92 (3.4)%Customer complaints (d)1.99 1.80 (10.6)%(a) Percentage of reported flight operations arriving on time as defined by the DOT.(b) Percentage of scheduled flight operations completed.(c) Rate of mishandled baggage reports per 1,000 passengers.(d) Rate of customer complaints filed with the DOT per 100,000 enplanements.Frequent Flyer Programs American established AAdvantage® to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage. We believe that the AAdvantage program is one of our competitive strengths. AAdvantage benefits from a growing base of approximately 74 million members with desirable demographics who have demonstrated a strong willingness to collect AAdvantage miles over other loyalty program incentives and are generally disposed to adjusting their purchasing behavior in order to earn additional AAdvantage miles. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, the American Eagle carriers, the third-party regional carriers and other participating airlines or by using services of other participants in the AAdvantage program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, the American Eagle carriers or other participating airlines, or for other awards. Once a member accrues sufficient mileage for an award, the member may book award travel. Most travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. A member\\'s mileage credit does not expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 18 months.American sells mileage credits and related services to other participants in the AAdvantage program. There are over 1,000 program participants, including a leading credit card issuer (Citibank), hotels, car rental companies and other products and services companies in the AAdvantage program. We believe that program participants benefit from the sustained purchasing behavior of AAdvantage members, which translates into a recurring stream of revenues for AAdvantage. Under our agreements with AAdvantage members and program participants, we reserve the right to change the AAdvantage program at any time without notice, and may end the program with six months notice. As of December 31, 2013, AAdvantage had approximately 74 million total members, and 622.3 billion outstanding award miles. During 2013, AAdvantage issued approximately 202.8 billion miles, of which approximately 64% were sold to program participants. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for more information on AAdvantage.US Airways offers a similar frequent flyer program under the Dividend Miles brand that allows participants to earn mileage credits for each paid flight segment on US Airways and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Participants flying in first class or US Airways\\' international business class (Envoy class) may receive additional mileage credits. Participants can also receive mileage credits through special promotions that US Airways periodically offers and may also earn mileage credits by utilizing certain credit cards and purchasing services from non-airline partners such as hotels and rental car agencies. US 18Airways sells mileage credits to credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies and others that participate in the Dividend Miles program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel awards on US Airways or other participating airlines.US Airways and the other participating airline partners limit the number of seats per flight that are available for redemption by award recipients by using various inventory management techniques. Award travel is generally not permitted on blackout dates, which correspond to certain holiday periods or peak travel dates. We charge various fees for issuing awards dependent upon destination and booking method and for issuing awards within 21 days of the travel date. We reserve the right to terminate Dividend Miles or portions of the program at any time. Program rules, partners, special offers, blackout dates, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change. Effective January 7, 2014, AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members can earn and redeem miles when traveling across either airline\\'s network. All travel on eligible tickets on both airlines will count toward qualification for elite status in the customer\\'s program of choice. Elite members of each airline can enjoy select reciprocal benefits of both the AAdvantage and Dividend Miles programs, including First and Business Class check-in, priority security and priority boarding, complimentary access to Preferred Seats, priority baggage delivery, and checked bags at no charge, consistent with the current baggage policies for each carrier.The US Airways Dividend Miles program will transition to the AAdvantage frequent flyer program as soon as commercially feasible.Ticket DistributionPassengers can book tickets for travel on American or US Airways through several distribution channels including their direct websites (www.aa.com and www.usairways.com), our reservations centers and third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents and online travel agents (e.g., Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity). To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"We rely on third party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.\"Seasonality and Other Factors Due to the greater demand for air and leisure travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. General economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease, and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Accordingly, the results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year.Unaudited quarterly financial data for the two-year period ended December 31, 2013 is included in Note 16 to AAG\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 15 to American\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.Available Information The SEC allows AAG and American to incorporate information by reference into this Form 10-K.

We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business.Risk Factors Relating to the Company and Industry-Related RisksWe could experience significant operating losses in the future.For a number of reasons, including those addressed in these risk factors, we might fail to achieve or maintain profitability and might experience significant losses. In particular, the condition of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices, the state of travel demand and intense competition in the airline industry have had and will continue to have an impact on our operating results, and may increase the risk that we will experience losses.Downturns in economic conditions adversely affect our business.Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending, airline industry revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel and changes in booking practices, both of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our revenues. In addition, during challenging economic times, actions by our competitors to increase their revenues can have an adverse impact on our revenues. See \"The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic\" below. Certain labor agreements to which we are a party limit our ability to reduce the number of aircraft in operation, and the utilization of such aircraft, below certain levels. As a result, we may not be able to optimize the number of aircraft in operation in response to a decrease in passenger demand for air travel.Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continued to be volatile in 2013.Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase in the price of fuel can have a material adverse aggregate effect on our operating results and liquidity. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares, impose fuel surcharges or otherwise increase revenues sufficiently to offset fuel price increases.Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, we cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future.We have a large number of older aircraft in our fleet, and these aircraft are not as fuel efficient as more recent models of aircraft, including those we have on order. We intend to continue to execute our fleet renewal plans to, among other things, improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet, and we are dependent on a limited number of major aircraft manufacturers to deliver aircraft on schedule. If we experience delays in delivery of the more fuel efficient aircraft that we have on order, we will be adversely affected. Our aviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide meaningful price protection against increases in fuel costs. Prior to the closing of the Merger, we sought to manage the risk of fuel price increases by using derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particular level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our derivative contracts. To the extent we use derivative contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if prices decline significantly, such derivative contracts may limit our ability to benefit from lower fuel costs in the future. Also, a rapid decline in the projected price of fuel at a time when we have fuel hedging contracts in place could adversely impact our short-term liquidity, because 25hedge counterparties could require that we post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit. See also the discussion in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - \"AAG Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions - Aircraft Fuel\" and \"American Airlines Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions - Aircraft Fuel.\"In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and regulations promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) introduce new requirements for centralized clearing for over-the-counter derivatives. This may include our fuel derivative contracts. Our board of directors has approved our election of the CFTC’s end-user exemption, which permits us as a non-financial end user of derivatives to hedge commercial risk and be exempt from the CFTC mandatory clearing requirements. However, depending on the final regulations adopted by the CFTC and other regulators, our derivative contract counterparties may be subject to regulatory requirements and resulting new practices that may raise their costs. Those increased costs may in turn be passed on to us, resulting in increased transaction costs to execute derivative contracts and lower credit thresholds to post collateral. We have not entered into any fuel hedges since the Effective Date and our current policy is not to do so. Assuming we continue to pursue this policy, once our existing hedge contracts expire or otherwise terminate, we will be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.Our competitors include other major domestic airlines and foreign, regional and new entrant airlines, as well as joint ventures formed by some of these airlines, many of which have more financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than ours, as well as other forms of transportation, including rail and private automobiles. In many of our markets we compete with at least one low-cost air carrier. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. These factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses, as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may institute pricing structures intended to achieve near-term survival rather than long-term viability.Low-cost carriers have a profound impact on industry revenues. Using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from larger, more established airlines. Some low-cost carriers, which have cost structures lower than ours, have better recent financial performance and have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of aircraft for delivery in the next few years. These low-cost carriers are expected to continue to increase their market share through growth and, potentially, consolidation, and could continue to have an impact on our overall performance. For example, amendments to the Wright Amendment have reduced geographic restrictions on operations by Southwest Airlines and other carriers at DAL and will eliminate all domestic non-stop geographic restrictions on operations there in October 2014. This has increased low-cost carrier competition for our operations at Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW). In addition, we expect that the two gates at DAL that we divested as part of our settlement of antitrust litigation related to the Merger will be allocated to low-cost carriers. The actions of the low-cost carriers, including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.Certain airline alliances have been, or may in the future be, granted immunity from antitrust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to effectively compete may be hindered.We have implemented a JBA with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, and antitrust-immunized cooperation with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair and Royal Jordanian. We are in negotiations with IAG concerning the terms by which flights operated by US Airways will be added to our existing transatlantic joint business. We have thus far been unable to reach agreement with IAG and are uncertain if we will be able to reach an agreement. Failure to reach an agreement could have a material adverse effect on the JBA or cause its dissolution, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. In addition, we have implemented an antitrust-immunized JBA with Japan Airlines and a JBA with Qantas. No assurances can be given as to any other arrangements that may ultimately be implemented or any benefits that we may derive from such arrangements.Additional mergers and other forms of industry consolidation, including antitrust immunity grants, may take place and may not involve us as a participant. Depending on which carriers combine and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other carriers in connection with such combinations, our competitive position relative to the post-combination carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. In addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or antitrust immunity grants, their route networks will grow, and that growth will result in greater overlap with our network, which in turn could result in lower overall market share and revenues for us. Such consolidation is not limited to the U.S., but could include further consolidation among international carriers in Europe and elsewhere.26We may be unable to integrate operations successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Merger.The Merger involves the combination of two companies that operated as independent public companies prior to the Merger, and each of which operated its own international network airline. Historically, the integration of separate airlines has often proven to be more time consuming and to require more resources than initially estimated. We must devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices, cultures and operations. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:•the inability to successfully combine our businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the Merger; •the challenge of integrating complex systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, aircraft fleets, networks, and other assets in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies; •the effects of divestitures and other operational commitments in connection with the settlement of the litigation brought by the DOJ and certain states prior to the closing of the Merger;•the challenge of forming and maintaining an effective and cohesive management team;•the diversion of the attention of our management and other key employees; •the challenge of integrating workforces while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality customer service and running an efficient operation; •the risks relating to integrating various computer, communications and other technology systems, including designing and implementing an integrated customer reservations system, that will be necessary to operate American and US Airways as a single airline and to achieve cost synergies by eliminating redundancies in the businesses;•the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing business; •the branding or rebranding initiatives may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers; and•the potential unknown liabilities, liabilities that are significantly larger than we currently anticipate and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the Merger, including costs in excess of the cash transition costs that we currently anticipate. We have submitted to the FAA a transition plan for merging the day-to-day operations of American and US Airways under a single operating certificate. The issuance of a single operating certificate will occur when the FAA agrees that we have achieved a level of integration that can be safely managed under one certificate. While the parties currently believe that such approval can be obtained within two years from the closing of the Merger, the actual time required and cost incurred to receive this approval cannot be predicted. Any delay in the grant of such approval or increase in costs beyond those presently expected could have a material adverse effect on the completion date of our integration plan and receipt of the benefits expected from that plan.See \"We may face challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems\" below.Accordingly, we may not be able to realize the contemplated benefits of the Merger fully, or at all, or it may take longer and cost more to realize such benefits than expected.Our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could adversely affect our business and liquidity.We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a substantial portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, they:•limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, to withstand operating risks that are customary in the industry, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, integration costs, and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained; •require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;•make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and catastrophic external events; •contain restrictive covenants that could:▪limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends; and ▪significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of 27opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines; and •limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.Our business plan contemplates significant investments in modernizing our fleet and integrating the American and US Airways businesses. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan, and, as a result, we estimate that, based on our commitments as of December 31, 2013, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2014-2018 would be approximately $19.5 billion of which $16.3 billion represents commitments by American. We also currently anticipate cash transition costs to integrate our businesses following the Merger to be approximately $1.2 billion, and these costs could exceed our expectations. Accordingly, we will need substantial financing or other capital resources. In addition, as of the date of this report, we had not secured financing commitments for some of the aircraft that we have on order, and we cannot be assured of the availability or cost of that financing. In particular, we do not have financing commitments for the following aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered through 2016: 16 Airbus 320 family aircraft, 10 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft and 18 Boeing 787 aircraft. In addition, we do not have financing commitments in place for the majority of aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered in 2017 and beyond. The number of aircraft for which we do not have financing may change as we exercise purchase options or otherwise change our purchase and delivery schedules. If we are unable to arrange financing for such aircraft at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase such aircraft or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft with the aircraft manufacturers. Depending on numerous factors, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital at the time we seek capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may only be available on onerous terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Increased costs of financing, a reduction in the availability of financing and fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, the availability and cost of credit, energy costs and geopolitical issues, combined with continued changes in business activity levels and consumer confidence, increased unemployment and volatile oil prices, have contributed to unprecedented levels of volatility in the capital and credit markets. As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit have in the recent past been and may in the future be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. These changes in the domestic and global financial markets may increase our costs of financing and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing needed for the acquisition of aircraft that we have contractual commitments to purchase and for other types of financings we may seek in order to refinance debt maturities, raise capital or fund other types of obligations. Any downgrades to our credit rating may likewise increase the cost and reduce the availability of financing.Further, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate for deposits of U.S. dollars (LIBOR). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions, general interest rates, rates set by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities and other of our floating rate debt, and accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period may fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \"AAG Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions - Interest\" and \"American Airlines Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions - Interest.\"Our high level of fixed obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and causes our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, pension costs, aircraft leases and financings, aircraft purchase commitments, leases and developments of airport and other facilities and other cash obligations. We also have certain guaranteed costs associated with our regional operations. 28As a result of the substantial fixed costs associated with these obligations:•a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater percentage decrease in earnings; •we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund all of these fixed obligations if our revenues decline or costs increase; and •we may have to use our working capital to fund these fixed obligations instead of funding general corporate requirements, including capital expenditures. These obligations also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.We have significant pension and other post-employment benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our pension funding obligations are significant. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. Currently, our minimum funding obligation for our pension plans is subject to temporary favorable rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Upon the expiration of those rules, our funding obligations are likely to increase materially. In addition, we may have significant obligations for other post-employment benefits depending on the outcome of an adversary proceeding related to retiree medical and life insurance obligations filed in the Chapter 11 cases.Any failure to comply with the covenants contained in our financing arrangements may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The terms of our 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility and the Credit Facilities require us to ensure that AAG and its restricted subsidiaries maintain consolidated unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities in an aggregate amount not less than $2.0 billion, and the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility also requires us and the other obligors thereunder to hold not less than $750 million (subject to partial reductions upon certain reductions in the outstanding amount of the loan) of that amount in accounts subject to control agreements.Our ability to comply with these liquidity covenants while paying the fixed costs associated with our contractual obligations and our other expenses, including significant pension and other post-employment funding obligations and cash transition costs associated with the Merger, will depend on our operating performance and cash flow, which are seasonal, as well as factors including fuel costs and general economic and political conditions. In addition, our credit facilities and certain other financing arrangements include covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.The factors affecting our liquidity (and our ability to comply with related liquidity and other covenants) will remain subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. Any breach of our liquidity and other covenants or failure to timely pay our obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including the acceleration of our indebtedness, the withholding of credit card proceeds by our credit card processors and the exercise of remedies by our creditors and lessors. In such a situation, we may not be able to fulfill our contractual obligations, repay the accelerated indebtedness, make required lease payments or otherwise cover our fixed costs.If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, the failure of American to maintain certain levels of liquidity) to hold an amount of our cash (a \"holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that company, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. We are not currently required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. An increase in the current holdback balances to higher percentages up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales could materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other entities to impose less favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition.29The historical consolidated financial information contained in this report is not directly comparable to our financial information for prior or future periods.A number of factors render our historical consolidated financial information not directly comparable to our financial information for prior or future periods, including:•because the Merger was completed on December 9, 2013, AAG\\'s consolidated results of operations include the results of US Airways Group and its subsidiaries only for 23 days of 2013;•the Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with AAG as the acquiring entity, resulting in an adjustment to the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of US Airways Group compared to its historical carrying values;•during the course of our Chapter 11 Cases and in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11 and the effectiveness of the Plan, we recorded material expenses, charges, costs and other accounting entries related to our restructuring process, many of which generally had not been incurred in the past and are not expected to be incurred in the future; and•certain prior accounting presentations, including the manner in which we report our regional operations, have been changed and historical results restated to conform to the current presentation.Due to these and other factors largely related to the Merger and the Plan, investors are cautioned as to the limitations of our historical financial statements and urged to review carefully Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain \"amendable dates\" rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board (NMB).If no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day \"cooling off\" period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day \"cooling off\" period. At the end of a \"cooling off\" period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise \"self-help,\" such as a strike, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are currently in negotiations with the IAM with respect to US Airways mechanics, stock clerks and related employees, and fleet service employees, and the AFA with respect to Piedmont flight attendants. None of these unions presently may lawfully engage in concerted refusals to work, such as strikes, slow-downs, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. See Part I, Item 1 Business-\"Employees and Labor Relations.\"The inability to maintain labor costs at competitive levels would harm our financial performance.Currently, we believe our labor costs are competitive relative to the other large network carriers. However, we cannot provide assurance that labor costs going forward will remain competitive because some of our agreements are amendable now and others may become amendable, competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs or we may agree to higher-cost provisions in our current or future labor negotiations. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 73% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions. Some of our unions have brought and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration, including related to wages. Unions may also bring court actions and may seek to compel us to engage in bargaining processes where we believe we have no such obligation. If successful, there is a risk these judicial or arbitral avenues could create material additional costs that we did not anticipate.Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.We operate principally through hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Substantially all of our flights either originate in or fly into one of these locations. 30A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs resulting from ATC delays, weather conditions, natural disasters, growth constraints, relations with third-party service providers, failure of computer systems, facility disruptions, labor relations, power supplies, fuel supplies, terrorist activities or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate Slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.In order to operate our existing and proposed flight schedule and, where appropriate, add service along new or existing routes, we must be able to maintain and/or obtain adequate gates, ticketing facilities, operations areas, and office space. As airports around the world become more congested, we will not always be able to ensure that our plans for new service can be implemented in a commercially viable manner, given operating constraints at airports throughout our network, including due to inadequate facilities at desirable airports. Further, our operating costs at airports at which we operate, including our hubs, may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that we may be required to fund, directly or indirectly. In some circumstances, such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without our approval.In addition, operations at four major domestic airports, certain smaller domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through the use of Slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each Slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period and may have other operational restrictions as well. In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of Slot or Slot exemptions at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and three New York City airports: Newark, JFK and LaGuardia. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of Slots or similar regulatory authority. Similarly, our operations at international airports in Frankfurt, London Heathrow, Paris and other airports outside the U.S. are regulated by local Slot authorities pursuant to the International Air Transport Association’s Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We cannot provide any assurance that regulatory changes regarding the allocation of Slots or similar regulatory authority will not have a material adverse impact on our operations. For example, the FAA is planning a new rulemaking in 2014 to modify the current rules limiting flight operations at New York City’s JFK and LaGuardia airports.In connection with the settlement of litigation relating to the Merger brought by the DOJ and certain states, we entered into settlement agreements that provide for certain asset divestitures. In the agreement with the United States government, among other things, we agreed to divest and not reacquire for ten years certain rights and assets consisting of 52 Slot pairs at Washington Reagan National Airport, and 17 Slot pairs at LaGuardia, in each case together with and associated gates and related ground facilities necessary to operate those Slot pairs, and two gates at each of Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International Airport. The agreement with the plaintiff states requires our airlines, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, to maintain certain hub operations in a manner generally consistent with historical operations and to continue to provide scheduled daily service to certain specified communities, both for limited periods of time. In addition, we entered into a related settlement with the DOT related to small community service from Washington Reagan National Airport. Further, as a consequence of the Merger clearance process in the EU, we are required to make available one pair of London Heathrow Slots for use by another carrier between London and Philadelphia, which the acquiring carrier can deploy on another Heathrow city pair after operating the Slots on London-Philadelphia for a period of not less than three consecutive years, and, along with our JBA partners, we are required to make available for an initial period of up to seven years one pair of Heathrow Slots for service between London and Miami that may be operated via an intermediate point.Any limitation on our ability to acquire or maintain adequate gates, ticketing facilities, operations areas, Slots (where applicable), or office space could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If we incur problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.A significant portion of our regional operations are conducted by third-party operators on our behalf, primarily under capacity purchase agreements. Due to our reliance on third parties to provide these essential services, we are subject to the risks of disruptions to their operations, which may result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this report, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions, and other risk factors, such as a bankruptcy restructuring of any of the regional operators. We may also experience disruption to our regional operations if we terminate the capacity purchase agreement with one or more of our current operators and transition the services to another provider. As our regional segment provides revenues to us directly and indirectly (by providing flow traffic to our hubs), any significant disruption to our regional operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.31In addition, our reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of our operations may result in our relative inability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. We have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology and services, regional operations, aircraft maintenance, ground services and facilities, reservations and baggage handling. Similar agreements may be entered into in any new markets we decide to serve. These agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party service provider. We are also at risk should one of these service providers cease operations, and there is no guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis with comparably priced providers. Volatility in fuel prices, disruptions to capital markets and adverse economic conditions in general have subjected certain of these third-party regional carriers to significant financial pressures, which have led to several bankruptcies among these carriers. Any material problems with the efficiency and timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.We rely on third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems, or GDSs (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents and online travel agents, or OTAs (e.g., Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity), to distribute a significant portion of our airline tickets, and we expect in the future to continue to rely on these channels and hope to expand their ability to distribute and collect revenues for ancillary products (e.g., fees for selective seating). These distribution channels are more expensive and at present have less functionality in respect of ancillary product offerings than those we operate ourselves, such as our call centers and our website. Certain of these distribution channels also effectively restrict the manner in which we distribute our products generally. To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and DOT, the FAA, the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security have issued a number of directives and other regulations, that affect the airline industry. These requirements impose substantial costs on us and restrict the ways we may conduct our business.For example, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. Our failure to timely comply with these requirements has in the past and may in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. In addition, the FAA recently issued its final regulations governing pilot rest periods and work hours for all airlines certificated under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The rule, which became effective on January 4, 2014, impacts the required amount and timing of rest periods for pilots between work assignments and modifies duty and rest requirements based on the time of day, number of scheduled segments, flight types, time zones, and other factors. These regulations, or other regulations, could have a material adverse effect on us and the industry.Recent DOT consumer rules require new procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, further regulate airline interactions with passengers through the reservations process, at the airport, and on board the aircraft, and require new disclosures concerning airline fares and ancillary fees such as baggage fees. The DOT has been aggressively investigating alleged violations of these new rules. Other DOT rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international airlines.The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per-ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines.The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct business each may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including:•changes in law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports, or the types of fees that can be charged to passengers;•the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including antitrust or foreign government 32approvals) needed for codesharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines; •restrictions on competitive practices (for example, court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an airline’s ability to respond to a competitor); •the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations that impact customer service standards (for example, a \"passenger bill of rights\"); •restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of Slots at airports or the auction or reallocation of Slot rights currently held by us; and •the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions. Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to airline operations and, in some cases, may reduce the demand for air travel. There can be no assurance that our compliance with new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us.In April 2013, the FAA announced the imposition of furloughs that resulted in reduced staffing, including among air traffic controllers, in connection with its implementation of budget reductions related to the federal government’s response to the so-called \"sequester\" of government funding. These furloughs have been suspended as a result of Congressional legislation. However, we cannot predict whether there will be further furloughs or the impact of any such furloughs on our business. Any significant reduction in air traffic capacity at key airports in the U.S. could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also experienced delays in routine non-operational interactions with the FAA as a result of the government shut-down in 2013, and we may experience delays again in the event of any future government shut-down.In addition, the ATC system is not successfully managing the growing demand for U.S. air travel. Air traffic controllers rely on outdated technologies that routinely overwhelm the system and compel airlines to fly inefficient, indirect routes. On February 14, 2012, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 was signed. The law provides funding for the FAA to rebuild its ATC system, including switching from radar to a GPS-based system. It is uncertain when any improvements to the ATC system will take effect. Failure to update the ATC system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements that may be imposed on airlines of a modernized ATC system may have a material adverse effect on our business. The ability of U.S. airlines to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the U.S. and foreign governments may be amended from time to time and appropriate Slots or facilities may not be made available. We currently operate on a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of airlines permitted to operate on the route, the capacity of the airlines providing services on the route, or the number of airlines allowed access to particular airports. If an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes, such an event could have a material adverse impact on us and could result in the impairment of material amounts of our related tangible and intangible assets. In addition, competition from revenue-sharing joint ventures, JBAs, and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of our business and assets on the open skies routes. For example, the open skies air services agreement between the U.S. and the EU, which took effect in March 2008, provides airlines from the U.S. and EU member states open access to each other’s markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly from the U.S. to any airport in the EU, including London’s Heathrow Airport. As a result of the agreement, we face increased competition in these markets, including Heathrow Airport. In addition, the open skies agreement between the U.S. and Brazil, which was signed in 2010 and takes full effect in 2015, has resulted in increased competition in the U.S./Brazil market.The airline industry is heavily taxed.The airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue. The U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries. These fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights, and various U.S. fees and taxes also are assessed on international flights. For example, as permitted by federal legislation, most major U.S. airports impose a passenger facility charge per passenger on us. In addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us, various fees and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent years. Moreover, we are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the \"ticket tax,\" on domestic and international air transportation. We collect the excise tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation (such as a per-ticket tax on passengers to fund the TSA, which fee is scheduled to increase effective July 1, 2014), and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although these taxes are not operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. There are continuing efforts in Congress and in other countries to raise different portions of the various taxes, fees, and charges imposed on airlines and their passengers. Increases in such taxes, fees and charges could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under DOT regulations, all governmental taxes and fees must be included in the prices we quote or advertise to our 33customers. Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the customer. Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel, and thus our revenues. For example, in January 2014, Congress restructured the September 11 security fee, which will increase the fee on some customers.Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.We have implemented several new measures designed to increase revenue and offset costs. These measures include charging separately for services that had previously been included within the price of a ticket and increasing other pre-existing fees. We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on, we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional initiatives. We cannot assure you that these new measures or any future initiatives will be successful in increasing our revenues. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives creates logistical challenges that could harm the operational performance of our airline. Also, the new and increased fees might reduce the demand for air travel on our airline or across the industry in general, particularly if weakened economic conditions continue to make our customers more sensitive to increased travel costs or provide a significant competitive advantage to other carriers that determine not to institute similar charges.The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns.Acts of terrorism or fear of such attacks, including elevated national threat warnings, wars or other military conflicts, may depress air travel, particularly on international routes, and cause declines in revenues and increases in costs. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and continuing terrorist threats and attempted attacks materially impacted and continue to impact air travel. Increased security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks and other such measures as may be introduced in the future generate higher operating costs for airlines. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals on board flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to U.S. Customs and enhanced background checks. A concurrent increase in airport security charges and procedures, such as restrictions on carry-on baggage, has also had and may continue to have a disproportionate impact on short-haul travel, which constitutes a significant portion of our flying and revenue.We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.We operate a global business with operations outside of the U.S. from which American derived approximately 40% of its operating revenues and US Airways derived approximately 24% of its operating revenues in 2013, as measured and reported to the DOT. Our current international activities and prospects have been and in the future could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls or other restrictions on repatriation of funds, currency and political risks (including changes in exchange rates and currency devaluations, which are more likely in countries with exchange controls such as Venezuela and Argentina), environmental regulation, increases in taxes and fees and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or Slots.In particular, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, and exchange controls and other restrictions on the repatriation of funds, have significantly affected and may continue to significantly affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the U.S. in local currency. For example, the business environment in Venezuela has been challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluation, high inflation and governmental restrictions, including currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $710 million of our unrestricted cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars, valued at a weighted average rate of 6.04 bolivars to the dollar. The period of time to exchange those funds into dollars and repatriate them has been increasing and is presently more than a year. On January 23, 2014, the Venezuelan government 34issued a regulation to implement a new system for determining the exchange rate based on the result of limited periodic sales of dollars known as Sicad auctions (currently 11.80 to the dollar based on the February 21, 2014 Sicad auction) for repatriation of income from future ticket sales, and introduced new procedures for approval of conversion and repatriation of local currency. The government also enacted a new law effective February 19, 2014 that authorizes additional methods of exchanging Venezuelan bolivars at rates other than the controlled base rate of 6.3 to the dollar or the existing Sicad auction rate, but the regulations necessary to implement the law are still pending and it is not clear at this point whether or how the new methods may impact the pending balances of Venezuelan bolivars held by airlines. We are working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. Further, the current, devalued rates may have an ongoing adverse effect on our reported results if we are unable to fully adjust prices on flights to and from Venezuela, of which there can be no assurance. More generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by the Company and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to many forms of environmental regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result.We are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. Compliance with all environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties.The EPA has proposed changes to underground storage tank regulations that could affect certain airport fuel hydrant systems. Airport systems that fall within threshold requirements would need to be modified in order to comply with applicable regulations. Additionally, the EPA has proposed the draft 2013 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Industrial Activities. This permit would impose new limitations on certain discharges along with mandatory best management practices. Concurrently, California has proposed the State Final Draft Industrial General Permit for stormwater discharges. This permit employs the use of benchmark values to trigger response actions when exceeding those limits and eliminates group monitoring. These permits have not been finalized, and cost estimates have not been defined, but American and US Airways along with other airlines would share a portion of these costs at applicable airports. In addition to the proposed EPA and state regulations, several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of de-icing fluid to the environment, often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport de-icing facilities. Such efforts are likely to impose additional costs and restrictions on airlines using those airports. We do not believe, however, that such environmental developments will have a material impact on our capital expenditures or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations, operating costs or competitive position.We are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations, including those that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to us. We have liability for investigation and remediation costs at various sites, although such costs are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.We have various leases and agreements with respect to real property, tanks and pipelines with airports and other operators. Under these leases and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor or operator against environmental liabilities associated with the real property or operations described under the agreement, even if we are not the party responsible for the initial event that caused the environmental damage. We also participate in leases with other airlines in fuel consortiums and fuel committees at airports, where such indemnities are generally joint and several among the participating airlines.There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the EU has established the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in the EU. The EU adopted a directive under which each EU member state is required to extend the ETS to aviation operations. This directive would have required us, beginning in 2012, to annually submit emission allowances in order to operate flights to and from airports in the European Economic Area (EEA), including flights between the U.S. and EU member states. However, in an effort to allow ICAO time to propose an alternate scheme to manage global aviation emissions, in April 2013 the EU suspended for one year the ETS\\' application to flights entering and departing the EEA, limiting its application, for flights flown in 2012, to intra-EEA flights only. In October 2013, the ICAO Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the development through ICAO of a global, market-based scheme for aviation emissions, to be implemented in 2020. Subsequently, the EU has proposed amending the EU ETS so 35that the monitoring, reporting and submission of allowances for emissions from flights flown in 2013 would continue to be limited to only intra-EEA flights. For flights flown from 2014 to 2020, the scope of coverage under the amendment would include intra-EEA flights and the portion of aviation emissions of flights to and from EU member states that take place in European regional airspace. The U.S. enacted legislation in November 2012 which encourages the DOT to seek an international solution through ICAO and that will allow the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the ETS. Ultimately, the scope and application of ETS or other emissions trading schemes to our operations, now or in the near future, remains uncertain. We do not anticipate any significant emissions allowance expenditures in 2014. Beyond 2014, compliance with the ETS or similar emissions-related requirements could significantly increase our operating costs. Further, the potential impact of ETS or other emissions-related requirements on our costs will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including baseline emissions, the price of emission allowances and the number of future flights subject to ETS or other emissions-related requirements. These costs have not been completely defined and could fluctuate. Similarly, within the U.S., there is an increasing trend toward regulating greenhouse gas emissions directly under the Clean Air Act. While the EPA\\'s recent regulatory activity in this area has focused on industries other than aviation, it is possible that future EPA regulations, or new legislation, could impact airlines. Several states are also considering initiatives to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emissions inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the U.S. at the federal and state levels, are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs will be in the U.S., the EU or in other areas in which we do business. However, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs.Governmental authorities in several U.S. and foreign cities are also considering, or have already implemented, aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews and limitations on daytime take-offs and landings. We have been able to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, but our operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on technology and automated systems to operate our business and achieve low operating costs. These technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation systems, flight operations systems, financial planning, management and accounting systems, telecommunications systems, website, maintenance systems and check-in kiosks. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver flight information, as well as issue electronic tickets and process critical financial information in a timely manner. Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets. We depend on our reservation system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party service provider, to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. If our automated systems are not functioning or if our third-party service providers were to fail to adequately provide technical support, system maintenance or timely software upgrades for any one of our key existing systems, we could experience service disruptions or delays, which could harm our business and result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues. In the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operations or fails to perform as promised, replacement services may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all, and any transition time to a new system may be significant. Our automated systems cannot be completely protected against other events that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, data theft, equipment and software failures, computer viruses or telecommunications failures. Substantial or sustained system failures could cause service delays or failures and result in our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. We cannot assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans are adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. Disruption in or changes to these systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We face challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems.Among the principal risks of integrating our businesses and operations are the risks relating to integrating various computer, communications and other technology systems, including designing and implementing an integrated customer reservations system, that will be necessary to operate US Airways and American as a single airline and to achieve cost synergies by eliminating redundancies in the businesses. The integration of these systems in a number of prior airline mergers has taken longer, been more disruptive and cost more than originally forecast. The implementation process to integrate these various systems will involve a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 36New systems will replace multiple legacy systems and the related implementation will be a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware, software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business and financial processes.As with any large project, there will be many factors that may materially affect the schedule, cost and execution of the integration of our computer, communications and other technology systems. These factors include, among others: problems during the design, implementation and testing phases; systems delays and/or malfunctions; the risk that suppliers and contractors will not perform as required under their contracts; the diversion of management attention from daily operations to the project; reworks due to unanticipated changes in business processes; challenges in simultaneously activating new systems throughout our global network; difficulty in training employees in the operations of new systems; the risk of security breach or disruption; and other unexpected events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans will be adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. Disruptions in or changes to these systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Ongoing data security compliance requirements could increase our costs, and any significant data breach could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business requires the appropriate and secure utilization of customer and other sensitive information. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities (including cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses and the like), discovery of new vulnerabilities or attempts to exploit existing vulnerabilities in our systems, other data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access and store sensitive information. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Furthermore, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security in the U.S. and abroad (particularly in the EU), including requirements for varying levels of customer notification in the event of a data breach.In addition, many of our commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that we must meet. In particular, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by the credit card companies, to comply with their highest level of data security standards. While we continue our efforts to meet these standards, new and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs.Failure to comply with the Payment Card Industry Standards or other privacy and data use and security requirements of our partners or related laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject may expose us to claims for contract breach, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to address these issues appropriately could also give rise to additional legal risks, which, in turn, could increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur further related costs and expenses.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving any of our aircraft or the aircraft of our regional or codeshare operators.If one of our aircraft, an aircraft that is operated under our brand by one of our regional operators or an aircraft that is operated by an airline with which we have a marketing alliance or codeshare relationship were to be involved in an accident, we could be exposed to significant tort liability. The insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate. In the event that our insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate, an aircraft that is operated under our brand by one of our regional operators or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of our business depends on, among other things, the ability to operate an optimum number and type of aircraft. In many cases, the aircraft we intend to operate are not yet in our fleet, but we have contractual commitments to purchase or lease them. If for any reason we were unable to accept or secure deliveries of new aircraft on contractually scheduled delivery dates, this could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to integrate newly purchased aircraft into our fleet as planned might require us to seek extensions of the terms for some leased aircraft or 37otherwise delay the exit of certain aircraft from our fleet. Such unanticipated extensions or delays may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them, resulting in increased maintenance costs. If new aircraft orders are not filled on a timely basis, we could face higher operating costs than planned. In addition, if the aircraft we receive do not meet expected performance or quality standards, including with respect to fuel efficiency and reliability, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts.We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and many aircraft and engine parts. As a result, we are vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft, parts and engines, including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the suppliers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft.Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality.Our business, results of operations and financial condition has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:•actual or potential changes in international, national, regional, and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks, or political instability;•changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns, or demographic trends;•changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations, and other factors;•actual or potential disruptions to the ATC systems, including as a result of \"sequestration\" or any other interruption in government funding; •increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental measures; •outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and •weather and natural disasters. In particular, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, or any other influenza-type illness, if it were to persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel behavior. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.A higher than normal number of pilot retirements and a potential shortage of pilots could adversely affect us.We currently have a higher than normal number of pilots eligible for retirement. Among other things, the extension of pilot careers facilitated by the FAA’s 2007 modification of the mandatory retirement age from age 60 to age 65 has now been fully implemented, resulting in large numbers of pilots in the industry approaching the revised mandatory retirement age. If pilot retirements were to exceed normal levels in the future, it may adversely affect us. The FAA also recently issued regulations that increase the flight experience required for pilots working for airlines certificated under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. These and other factors could contribute to a shortage of qualified pilots, which could adversely affect us.Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact our operations and financial results.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers. Accordingly, our insurance costs increased significantly, and our ability to continue to obtain insurance even at current prices remains uncertain. In addition, we have obtained third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance through a special program administered by the FAA, resulting in lower premiums than if we had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market. The program has been extended, with the same conditions and premiums, until September 30, 2014. If the federal insurance program terminates, we would likely face a material increase in the cost of war risk insurance. The failure of one or more of our insurers could result in a lack of coverage for a period of time. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the claims paying ability of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. Because of competitive pressures in our industry, our ability to pass additional insurance costs to passengers is limited. As a result, further increases in insurance costs or reductions in available insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial results.38Several lawsuits were filed in connection with the Merger and remain pending, and these lawsuits could have a material adverse impact on our business.US Airways Group, as well as the members of US Airways Group’s board of directors, were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a purported class of US Airways Group’s stockholders challenging the Merger and seeking a declaration that the Merger Agreement is unenforceable, an injunction against the Merger (or rescission in the event it has been consummated), imposition of a constructive trust, an award of fees and costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees, and other relief. US Airways Group, US Airways, AMR and American were also named as defendants in a private antitrust lawsuit. The complaint alleges that the effect of the Merger may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. The relief sought in the complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or divestiture. In January 2014, the complaint was amended to add a claim for money damages and to request injunctive relief requiring the carriers to hold separate their assets. Such private lawsuits could result in an obligation to pay damages or terms, conditions, requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions that would impose additional material costs on or materially limit our revenues, or materially limit some of the synergies and other benefits we anticipate following the Merger. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings - \"Merger Class Action\" below.Our ability to utilize our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards may be limited.Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction in any taxable year for NOLs carried over from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards). As of December 31, 2013, we had available NOL Carryforwards of approximately $10.6 billion for regular federal income tax purposes which will expire, if unused, beginning in 1/1/2022, and approximately $4.7 billion for state income tax purposes which will expire, if unused, between 1/1/2014 and 12/31/2033. The amount of NOL Carryforwards for state income tax purposes that will expire, if unused, in 2014 is $106 million. Our NOL Carryforwards are subject to adjustment on audit by the Internal Revenue Service and the respective state taxing authorities.A corporation\\'s ability to deduct its federal NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an \"ownership change\" as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). We experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. While we anticipate taking advantage of certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that would permit approximately $9.0 billion of our federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382, there can be no assurance that these special rules will apply to the ownership change we experienced upon our emergence from bankruptcy, including that we may ultimately elect not to apply them. If the special rules do not apply, our ability to utilize such federal NOL Carryforwards may be subject to limitation. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways Group and its subsidiaries) are subject to limitation under Section 382 as a result of the Merger; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.Notwithstanding the foregoing, an ownership change subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards, our Certificate of Incorporation contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial shareholders. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur, in which case our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes could be severely limited or effectively eliminated.Our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards also will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. The NOL Carryforwards may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them.The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in AAG recording a significant amount of goodwill, which amount is tested for impairment at least annually. In addition, AAG and American may never realize the full value of their respective intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing them to record material impairment charges. In accordance with applicable acquisition accounting rules, AAG recorded goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet to the extent the US Airways Group acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of US Airway Group’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually. Also, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, AAG and American will be required to test their respective indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have 39occurred. In addition, AAG and American are required to test certain of their other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Future impairment of goodwill or other assets could be recorded in results of operations as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment could include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions; (ii) higher prices for jet fuel; (iii) lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand; (iv) a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments; and (v) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities, actual or threatened war, labor actions by employees, or further industry regulation. There can be no assurance that a material impairment charge of goodwill or tangible or intangible assets will be avoided. The value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by us or other airlines. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Relating to AAG\\'s Common StockThe price of our common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:•AAG\\'s operating and financial results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;•changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;•material announcements by us or our competitors;•movements in fuel prices;•new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;•general and industry-specific economic conditions; •the success or failure of AAG\\'s integration efforts;•changes in our key personnel;•the conversion of AAG Series A Preferred Stock issued pursuant to AAG\\'s plan of reorganization;•distributions of shares of our common stock pursuant to our plan of reorganization, including upon the conversion of AAL Preferred Stock and distributions from the disputed claims reserve established under the plan of reorganization upon the resolution of the underlying claims;•public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or issuances of our common stock upon the exercise or conversion of convertible securities, options, warrants, RSUs, SARs, or similar rights;•increases or decreases in reported holdings by insiders or other significant stockholders;•fluctuations in trading volume; and•changes in market values of airline companies as well as general market conditions.Certain provisions of AAG\\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws) make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial.Certain provisions of AAG\\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following:•advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders’ meetings;•the ability of our board of directors to fill vacancies on the board; •a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent; •a prohibition against stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders; •a requirement that holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors approve any amendment of our Bylaws submitted to stockholders for approval; and •super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation. These provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize the value of the interests of our stockholders. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable our board of directors to prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts 40to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. Interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is approved by the board of directors prior to the investment under Section 203.AAG\\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests.AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include certain provisions that limit voting and ownership and disposition of our equity interests, including AAG Common Stock, AAG Series A Preferred Stock and convertible notes. See Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters - \"Ownership Restrictions.\" These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of our common stock and other equity interests to vote such interests and adversely affect the ability of persons to acquire shares of our common stock and other equity interests.In order to protect AAG\\'s NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes, AAG\\'s Certificate of Incorporation includes certain limitations on acquisitions and dispositions of AAG\\'s common stock, which may limit the liquidity of our common stock.To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards and certain other tax attributes for federal income tax purposes, AAG\\'s Certificate of Incorporation contains certain restrictions on the acquisition and disposition of AAG\\'s common stock by substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG\\'s common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of AAG\\'s common stock. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an \"ownership change\" (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) from occurring, no assurance can be given that an ownership change will not occur even with these restrictions in place. See AAG\\'s Restated Certificate of Incorporation which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto.41ITEM 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSThe Company had no unresolved Securities and Exchange Commission staff comments at December 31, 2013.ITEM 2.PROPERTIESFlight EquipmentAs of December 31, 2013, American and US Airways operated a mainline fleet of 627 and 343 aircraft, respectively.

Our main operational facilities are associated with our hubs. At those locations and in other cities we serve, we maintain administrative offices, terminal, catering, cargo, training facilities, maintenance facilities and other facilities, in each case as necessary to support our operations in the particular city.We lease, or have built as leasehold improvements on leased property, most of our airport and terminal facilities in the U.S. and overseas, US Airways\\' corporate office building in Tempe, Arizona, our training facilities in Fort Worth, Texas, our principal overhaul and maintenance base in Tulsa, Oklahoma, our regional reservation offices, and local ticket and administration offices throughout the system. Our US Airways Operations Control Center is located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in a facility leased from the Allegheny County Airport Authority.We own our corporate headquarters building in Fort Worth, Texas. For information concerning the estimated lives and residual values for owned ground properties, lease terms and amortization relating to ground properties under capital leases, and acquisitions of ground properties, see Note 5 and Note 8 to AAG\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 4 and Note 7 to American\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.Terminal Construction ProjectsWe use public airports for our flight operations under lease or use arrangements with the municipalities or governmental agencies that own or control them and lease certain other ground equipment for use at such facilities. From time to time, airports undertake projects to improve or construct new facilities, which are typically funded through proceeds from special or general purpose bond offerings made by the respective airport governmental entity. Our airport lease and operating agreements typically provide that any costs for these new or improved airport facilities are passed through to us in the form of higher occupancy costs based on our relative percentage of occupancy at the airport. In certain circumstances, we agree to manage these airport projects.44American has entered into agreements with the Tulsa Municipal Airport Trust; the Alliance Airport Authority, Fort Worth, Texas; the New York City Industrial Development Agency; and the Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago O’Hare, Newark, San Juan, and Los Angeles airport authorities pursuant to which such entities issued special facility revenue bonds, the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the cost of constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring equipment which are leased by us. Prior to the Chapter 11 Cases, we entered into agreements with certain airport authorities pursuant to which such entities issued special facility revenue bonds, the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the cost of constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring equipment leased by the Company. The special facility revenue bonds are non-recourse to the issuer. Pursuant to the Plan, claims relating to special facility revenue bonds in connection with Alliance Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport (certain bond issuances only), Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Chicago O’Hare, Newark Airport, and Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico were treated as general unsecured claims. ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSChapter 11 Cases. As previously disclosed, on the Petition Date, November 29, 2011, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order approving and confirming the Debtors\\' Plan. On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group, with US Airways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG. From the Petition Date through the Effective Date, pursuant to automatic stay provisions under the Bankruptcy Code and orders granted by the Bankruptcy Court, all actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors generally were stayed. Following the Effective Date, actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of liabilities preceding the Petition Date, generally have been permanently enjoined. Any unresolved claims will continue to be subject to the claims reconciliation process under the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court. However, certain pending litigation related to pre-petition liabilities may proceed in courts other than the Bankruptcy Court to the extent the parties to such litigation have obtained relief from the permanent injunction. Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan has established a disputed claim reserve to hold shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock and AAG Common Stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders that ultimately become allowed Single-Dip general unsecured claimholders after emergence. The shares provided for under the Plan are determined based upon a disputed claim reserve amount of approximately $755 million. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of the remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to AAG but rather will be distributed by priority first, if necessary, to satisfy unsecured claims or labor-related obligations, and then to former AMR shareholders as of the Effective Date. AAG is not required to distribute additional shares above the 756 million shares contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay all allowed unsecured claims. However, resolution of disputed claims could have a material effect on Single-Dip creditor recoveries under the Plan and the amount of additional share distributions, if any, that are made to former AMR shareholders as the total number of shares of AAG Common Stock that remain available for distribution upon resolution of disputed claims is limited pursuant to the Plan.There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a determination that certain non-pension, post-employee benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be terminated without liability to American. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet ruled on this matter and we cannot predict whether American will receive relief from any of these obligations.Government Antitrust Actions. On August 13, 2013, the U.S. government, along with the States of Arizona, Florida, Tennessee and Texas, the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the District of Columbia (collectively, the plaintiff states), filed a complaint against US Airways Group and AMR in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the proposed Merger would substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and sought to permanently enjoin the transaction. On September 5, 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding the State of Michigan as a plaintiff. On October 1, 2013, the State of Texas entered into an agreement with US Airways Group and AMR that resolved that state’s objections to the Merger, and its claims were dismissed with prejudice on October 7, 2013. On November 11, 2013, US Airways and American entered into agreements with the U.S. government and the plaintiff states resolving all claims in the litigation. The agreement with the U.S. government requires the carriers to divest assets at certain airports and remains subject to public comment and court approval. In the agreement with the United States government, among other things, we agreed to divest and not reacquire for ten years certain rights and assets consisting of 52 Slot pairs at Washington Reagan National Airport, and 17 Slot pairs at LaGuardia, in each case together with and associated gates and related ground facilities necessary to operate those Slot pairs, and two gates at each of Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International 45Airport. The agreement with the plaintiff states, which was entered by the court on November 12, 2013, requires our airlines, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, to maintain certain hub operations in a manner generally consistent with historical operations and to continue to provide scheduled daily service to certain specified communities, both for limited periods of time. In addition, we entered into a related settlement with the DOT related to small community service from Washington Reagan National AirportMerger Class Action. On March 1, 2013, a complaint captioned Plumbers & Steamfitters Local Union No. 248 Pension Fund v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., No. CV2013-051605, was filed as a putative class action on behalf of the stockholders of US Airways Group in the Superior Court for Maricopa County, Arizona. On July 3, 2013, an amended complaint, captioned Dennis Palkon, et al. v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., No. CV2013-051605, was filed with the same court. The amended complaint names as defendants US Airways Group and the members of its board of directors, and alleges that the directors failed to maximize the value of US Airways Group in connection with the Merger and that US Airways Group aided and abetted those breaches of fiduciary duty. The relief sought in the amended complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or rescission in the event it has been consummated. The court in the above-referenced action denied the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order that had sought to enjoin the US Airways Group Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The above-referenced action was stayed pending the outcome of the antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. government and various states on August 13, 2013 (described above). This stay has now been lifted and a motion to dismiss this action filed by US Airways Group is pending before the court. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations. Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint names as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, and alleges that the effect of the Merger may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. The relief sought in the complaint includes an injunction against the Merger, or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants, and on October 2, 2013, dismissed the initial California action. The Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On January 10, 2014, the Plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add a claim for money damages and to request injunctive relief requiring the carriers to hold separate their assets. Trial is set for June 2014. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations. US Airways Sabre Matter. On April 21, 2011, US Airways Inc. filed an antitrust lawsuit against Sabre Holdings Corporation, Sabre Inc. and Sabre Travel International Limited (collectively, Sabre) in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit, as amended to date, alleges, among other things, that Sabre has engaged in anticompetitive practices to preserve its market power by restricting our ability to distribute our products to our customers. The lawsuit also alleges that these actions have permitted Sabre to charge supracompetitive booking fees and to use technologies that are not as robust and as efficient as alternatives in a competitive market. The lawsuit seeks both injunctive relief and money damages. Sabre filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the court denied in part and granted in part in September 2011 allowing two of the four counts in the complaint to proceed. We intend to pursue our claims against Sabre vigorously, but there can be no assurance of the outcome of this litigation.General. The Company and its subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within the control of the Company. Therefore, although the Company will vigorously defend itself in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on the Company are uncertain.ITEM 4.MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURESNot Applicable.46PART II ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ITEM 5.MARKET FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP\\'S COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESPursuant to the Plan and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, effective December 9, 2013, all existing shares of AMR Corporation common stock (OTCQB: AAMRQ) were canceled and ceased trading on the OTCQB market. The newly authorized and issued common stock of AAG began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) on December 9, 2013 under the symbol \"AAL.\" There is no trading market for the common stock of American, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG.As of February 21, 2014, the closing price of AAG Common Stock on NASDAQ was $36.17. As of February 21, 2014, there were 13,277 holders of record of the AAG Common Stock.In the past three years, no cash or other dividends have been declared on the AAG Common Stock. Under the provisions of certain debt agreements our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock is restricted. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable limitations under Delaware law, and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could adversely affect our business and liquidity\" and \"Any failure to comply with the covenants contained in our financing arrangements may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition,\" Part II, Item 7.

If non-citizens nonetheless at any time own and/or control more than the voting cap amount, the voting rights of the equity securities in excess of the voting cap amount shall be automatically suspended in accordance with the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Voting rights of equity securities, if any, owned (beneficially or of record) by non-citizens shall be suspended in reverse chronological order based upon the date of registration in the foreign stock record. Further, if at any time a transfer of equity securities to a non-citizen would result in non-citizens owning more than the absolute cap amount, such transfer shall be void and of no effect, in accordance with provisions of AAG\\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. In the event that we determine that the equity securities registered on the foreign stock record or the stock records of the Company exceed the absolute cap amount, sufficient shares shall be removed from the foreign stock record and the stock records of the Company so that the number of shares entered therein does not exceed the absolute cap amount. Shares of equity securities shall be removed from the foreign stock record and the stock records of the Company in reverse chronological order based on the date of registration in the foreign stock record and the stock records of the Company (subject to Article XIII, Section 6 of our Bylaws, which provides special rules applicable to equity securities issued upon effectiveness of our plan of reorganization and consummation of the Merger). Certificates for AAG\\'s equity securities must bear a legend set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation stating that such equity securities are subject to the foregoing restrictions. Under our Bylaws, it is the duty of each stockholder who is a non-citizen to register his, her or its equity securities on our foreign stock record. In addition, our Bylaws provide that in the event that non-citizens shall own (beneficially or of record) or have voting control over any equity securities, the voting rights of such persons shall be subject to automatic suspension to the extent required 47to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable provisions of law and regulations relating to ownership or control of a U.S. air carrier. See AAG’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are filed at Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2 hereto.In addition, to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards and certain other tax attributes for federal income tax purposes, our Certificate of Incorporation contains certain restrictions on the acquisition and disposition of our common stock by substantial stockholders (generally holders of more than 4.75%). See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"AAG\\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions limiting voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests\", and \"In order to protect our NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes, our Certificate of Incorporation includes certain limitations on acquisitions and dispositions of our common stock, which may limit the liquidity of our common stock.\"48ITEM 6.SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATASelected Consolidated Financial Data of AAGThe selected consolidated financial data presented below under the captions \"Consolidated Statements of Operations data\" and \"Consolidated Balance Sheet data\" for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 are derived from AAG\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

BUSINESS AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October 1982. AMR\\x92s operations fall almost entirely in the airline industry. AMR\\x92s principal subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc. (American), was founded in 1934. On April 9, 2001, American (through a wholly owned subsidiary, TWA Airlines LLC (TWA LLC)) purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), the eighth largest U.S. carrier at the time of the transaction. American is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2005, American provided scheduled jet service to approximately 150 destinations throughout North America, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and Asia. American is also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world, providing a wide range of freight and mail services to shippers throughout its system. In addition, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR, owns two regional airlines which do business as \\x93American Eagle\\x94 \\x97 American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (Executive) (collectively, the American Eagle® carriers). American also contracts with three independently owned regional airlines, which do business as the \\x93American Connection\\x94 (the American Connection® carriers). The American Eagle carriers and the American Connection carriers provide connecting service from eight of American\\x92s high-traffic cities to smaller markets throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. American Beacon Advisors, Inc. (American Beacon), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR, is responsible for the investment and oversight of assets of AMR\\x92s U.S. employee benefit plans, as well as AMR\\x92s short-term investments. It also serves as the investment manager of the American Beacon Funds, a family of mutual funds with both institutional and retail shareholders, and provides customized fixed income portfolio management services. As of December 31, 2005, American Beacon was responsible for the management of approximately $42.7 billion in assets, including direct management of approximately $18.8 billion in short-term fixed income investments. Recent Events The Company incurred an $861 million net loss in 2005 compared to a net loss of $761 million in 2004. The Company\\x92s results were impacted by the continuing increase in fuel prices and certain other costs, somewhat offset by an improvement in revenues and productivity improvements and other cost reductions resulting from progress under the Turnaround Plan. The average price per gallon of fuel increased 33.9 cents from 2003 to 2004 and 51.9 cents from 2004 to 2005. These price increases negatively impacted fuel expense by $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Continuing high fuel prices, additional increases in the price of fuel, and/or disruptions in the supply of fuel would further adversely affect the Company\\x92s financial condition and its results of operations. In order to fund its losses and limited capital spending during 2005 and to bolster its liquidity, the Company completed several financing transactions during the year. \\x95 American re-marketed $198 million of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Facility Improvement Corporation Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2000A, due May 1, 2029. \\x95 The New York City Industrial Development Agency issued $800 million of special facility revenue bonds on behalf of American, and $491 million of bond proceeds was paid to American to reimburse prior construction costs. \\x95 American sold and leased back 89 spare engines for net proceeds of $133 million. 1 Table of Contents \\x95 American purchased certain obligations due October 2006 with a face value of $261 million at par value from an institutional investor. In conjunction with the purchase, American borrowed an additional $245 million under an existing mortgage agreement with a final maturity in December 2012 from the same investor. \\x95 AMR issued 13 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $223 million. \\x95 AMR Eagle borrowed approximately $319 million (net of discount), under various debt agreements, related to the purchase of regional jet aircraft. The Company\\x92s ability to become profitable and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely beyond the Company\\x92s control. Some of the risk factors that affect the Company\\x92s business and financial results are discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A. As the Company seeks to improve its financial condition, it must continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce its costs. Although the Company has a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and revenue challenges, the ultimate success of these initiatives is not known at this time and cannot be assured. It will be very difficult, absent continued restructuring of its operations, for the Company to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, or to become profitable, if the overall industry revenue environment does not continue to improve and fuel prices remain at historically high levels for an extended period. Competition Domestic Air Transportation The domestic airline industry is fiercely competitive. Currently, any U.S. air carrier deemed fit by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its possessions. Most major air carriers have developed hub-and-spoke systems and schedule patterns in an effort to maximize the revenue potential of their service. American operates five hubs: Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago O\\x92Hare, Miami, St. Louis and San Juan, Puerto Rico. United Air Lines (United) also has a hub operation at Chicago O\\x92Hare. Delta Air Lines (Delta) previously operated a hub at DFW. In January 2005, however, Delta ceased hub operations at DFW. The American Eagle® carriers increase the number of markets the Company serves by providing connections at American\\x92s hubs and certain other major airports \\x97 Boston, Los Angeles, Raleigh/Durham and New York\\x92s LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports. The American Connection® carriers provide connecting service to American through St. Louis. American\\x92s competitors also own or have marketing agreements with regional carriers which provide similar services at their major hubs and other locations. On most of its domestic non-stop routes, the Company faces competing service from at least one, and sometimes more than one, domestic airline including: AirTran Airways, Alaska Airlines, ATA Airlines, Continental Airlines (Continental), Delta, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Northwest Airlines (Northwest), Southwest Airlines (Southwest), United, US Airways and their affiliated regional carriers. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition, the Company faces competition on some of its routes from carriers operating point-to-point service on such routes. The Company also competes with all-cargo and charter carriers and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation. On all of its routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other airlines. The Company must also compete with carriers that have recently reorganized or are reorganizing, including under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. It is possible that one or more other competitors may seek to reorganize in or out of Chapter 11. Successful reorganizations present the Company with competitors with significantly lower operating costs derived from renegotiated labor, supply and financing contracts. International Air Transportation In addition to its extensive domestic service, the Company provides international service to the Caribbean, Canada, Latin America, Europe and Asia. The Company\\x92s operating revenues from foreign operations were approximately 36 percent of the Company\\x92s total operating revenues in 2005, and 35 and 27 percent of the Company\\x92s total operating revenues in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additional information about the Company\\x92s foreign operations is included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. 2 Table of Contents In providing international air transportation, the Company competes with foreign investor-owned carriers, foreign state-owned carriers and U.S. airlines that have been granted authority to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations. The major U.S. air carriers have some advantage over foreign competitors in their ability to generate traffic from their extensive domestic route systems. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers\\x92 rights to carry passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. To improve access to each other\\x92s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers - including American \\x97 have established marketing relationships with other airlines and rail companies. American currently has marketing relationships with Aer Lingus, Air Pacific, Air Sahara, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern Airlines, Deutsche Bahn, EL AL, EVA Air, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Lan Airlines, Mexicana, Qantas Airways, SN Brussels, SNCF, Swiss International Air Lines, the TAM Group and Turkish Airlines. In the coming years, the Company expects to develop these programs further and to evaluate new alliances with other carriers. American is also a founding member of the oneworld alliance, which includes Aer Lingus, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Lan Airlines, Iberia, and Qantas. In addition, oneworld has extended invitations to Japan Airlines, Malev and Royal Jordanian. The oneworld alliance links the networks of the member carriers to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers\\x92 frequent flyer programs and access to the carriers\\x92 airport lounge facilities. Several of American\\x92s major competitors are members of marketing/operational alliances that enjoy antitrust immunity. American and British Airways, the largest members of the oneworld alliance, are restricted in their relationship because they lack antitrust immunity. They are, therefore, at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other alliances that have antitrust immunity. Price Competition The airline industry is characterized by substantial and intense price competition. Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company\\x92s financial results because the Company is generally required to match competitors\\x92 fares because failing to match would provide even less revenue because of customers\\x92 price sensitivity. During recent years, a number of low-cost carriers (LCCs) have entered the domestic market. Several major airlines, including the Company, have implemented efforts to lower their costs since lower cost structures enable airlines to offer lower fares. In addition, several air carriers have recently reorganized or are reorganizing, including under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, including United, Delta, US Airways and Northwest Airlines. Reorganization will allow these carriers to decrease operating costs. In the past, lower cost structures have generally resulted in fare reductions. If fare reductions are not offset by increases in passenger traffic, changes in the mix of traffic that improve yields (passenger revenue per passenger mile) and/or cost reductions, the Company\\x92s operating results will be negatively impacted. Distribution Systems The growing use of electronic ticket distribution systems provides the Company with an opportunity to lower its distribution costs. However, the continuous increase in pricing transparency resulting from the use of the Internet has enabled cost-conscious customers to more easily obtain the lowest fare on any given route. The Company continues to expand the capabilities of its Internet website \\x97 AA.com \\x97 and the use of electronic ticketing throughout the Company\\x92s network. In addition, the Company has marketing agreements with various Internet travel services. The Company anticipates additional reductions of distribution costs as it renegotiates certain agreements with global distribution system providers in 2006. The Company will continue to explore distribution cost reduction opportunities with traditional distribution channels and providers of alternative distribution technologies. 3 Table of Contents Although the majority of the tickets for travel on American and the American Eagle® carriers continue to be sold by travel agents, American no longer pays base commissions on tickets issued by travel agents in the United States, Puerto Rico, certain countries in Latin America, Canada, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Belgium. In addition, American has been actively pursuing reducing base commissions for other international points of sale. American continues, however, to pay certain incentive commissions to travel agents in connection with special revenue programs. American believes that other carriers also pay certain incentive commissions in connection with their own special revenue programs. Accordingly, airlines compete not only with respect to the price of the tickets sold, but also with respect to the amount of special revenue program commissions that may be paid. The Company also establishes incentive programs with corporate customers to increase revenues. The Company believes that its network breadth and local market presence in key cities allow it to have some advantages with corporate customers over other competitors. Regulation General The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation. However, the DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) still exercise certain regulatory authority over air carriers. The DOT maintains jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements, international route authorities and certain consumer protection and competition matters, such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. The FAA regulates flying operations generally, including establishing personnel, aircraft and certain security standards. As part of that oversight, the FAA has implemented a number of requirements that the Company has incorporated and is incorporating into its maintenance programs. The Company is progressing toward the completion of over 100 airworthiness directives including ATR Alpha thermal blanket replacements, enhanced ground proximity warning systems, McDonnell Douglas MD-80 main landing gear piston improvements, Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 pylon improvements, Boeing 737 elevator and rudder improvements and Airbus A300 structural improvements. Based on its current implementation schedule, the Company expects to be in compliance with the applicable requirements within the required time periods. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board certain regulatory functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements. International International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. The Company\\x92s operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or governmental authorities (such as the European Union), and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and various foreign governments of countries served by the Company are periodically subject to renegotiation. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, or otherwise adversely affect the Company\\x92s international operations. In addition, at some foreign airports, an air carrier needs slots (landing and take-off authorizations) before the air carrier can introduce new service or increase existing service. The availability of such slots is not assured and the inability of the Company to obtain and retain needed slots could therefore inhibit its efforts to compete in certain international markets. 4 Table of Contents The Company is one of four carriers that have exclusive rights to fly routes between London Heathrow airport and the United States. The United States government and the European Union are currently evaluating the possibility of allowing a greater number of carriers to fly these routes. To the extent additional carriers are granted the right to fly between Heathrow and the United States in the future, and are able to obtain the necessary slots and terminal facilities, the Company could suffer an adverse financial impact. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. Security In November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was enacted in the United States. The ATSA created a new government agency, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security and is responsible for aviation security. The ATSA mandates that the TSA provide for the screening of all passengers and property, including U.S. mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft. The ATSA also provides for increased security in flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights. Effective February 1, 2002, the ATSA imposed a $2.50 per enplanement security service fee ($5 one-way maximum fee), which is being collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures. Additionally, air carriers are annually required to submit to the government an amount equal to what the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000. President Bush has sought to increase both of these fees under spending proposals for the Department of Homeland Security. American and other carriers have announced their opposition to these proposals as there is no assurance that any increase in fees could be passed on to customers. Airline Fares Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which the Company serves. While air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions, fare overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets. Airport Access The FAA has designated New York John F. Kennedy (JFK), New York LaGuardia (LaGuardia), and Washington Reagan airports as high-density traffic airports. The high-density rule limits the number of Instrument Flight Rule operations \\x97 take-offs and landings \\x97 permitted per hour and requires that a slot support each operation. In April 2000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (Air 21 Act) was enacted. It will eliminate slot restrictions at JFK and LaGuardia airports in 2007. The Company expects that the elimination of these slot restrictions could create operational challenges, but does not expect the elimination of these slot restrictions to have a material adverse impact on the Company. Currently, the FAA permits the purchasing, selling, leasing or transferring of slots, except those slots designated as international, essential air service or Air 21 Act slots (certain slots at JFK, LaGuardia, and Washington Reagan airports). Trading of any domestic slot is permitted subject to certain parameters. Some foreign airports, including London Heathrow, a major European destination for American, also have slot allocations. Most foreign authorities do not officially recognize the purchasing, selling or leasing of slots. In addition, the Wright Amendment authorizes certain flight operations at Dallas Love Field within limited geographic areas. Southwest is actively lobbying to expand the authorization and, in November 2005, legislation was passed that added the State of Missouri to the areas that may be served to and from Love Field. The Company subsequently announced that it plans to provide service at Love Field in order to protect market share. The Company vigorously opposes any further expansion of the geographic service areas of Love Field because such expansion could have an adverse financial impact on the Company. Although the Company is constrained by slots, it currently has sufficient slot authorizations to operate its existing flights. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain slots in the future to expand its operations or change its schedules because, among other factors, slot allocations are subject to changes in government policies. 5 Table of Contents Environmental Matters The Company is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on the Company include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund Act). Certain operations of the Company are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on the Company\\x92s operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements. The ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The ANCA generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft. While the Company has had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, the Company\\x92s operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread. American has been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for contamination at the former Operating Industries, Inc. Landfill in Monterrey Park, CA (OII). American\\x92s alleged volumetric contributions at OII are small when compared with those of other PRPs. American is participating with a number of other PRPs in a Steering Committee that has conducted extensive negotiations with the EPA and state officials in recent years. Members of the Steering Committee, including American, have entered into a series of partial consent decrees with EPA and the State of California which address specific aspects of investigation and cleanup at OII. To date, American has paid approximately $1 million toward its share of cleanup costs under those consent decrees. Together with a number of other small-volume PRPs at OII, American seeks a settlement that will enable it to resolve all of its remaining past and present liabilities at OII in exchange for a one-time, lump-sum settlement payment. The amount of American\\x92s potential contribution towards such a settlement is not yet known, but American expects that its payment will be immaterial. American also has been named as a PRP for contamination at the Double Eagle Superfund Site in Oklahoma City, OK (Double Eagle). American\\x92s alleged volumetric contributions are small when compared with those of other PRPs. American is participating with a number of other PRPs at Double Eagle in a Joint Defense Group that is actively conducting settlement negotiations with the EPA and state officials. The group is seeking a settlement on behalf of its members that will enable American to resolve its past and present liabilities at Double Eagle in exchange for a one-time, lump-sum settlement payment. American expects that its payment will be immaterial. American, along with most other tenants at the San Francisco International Airport (SFIA), has been ordered by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board to engage in various studies of potential environmental contamination at the airport and to undertake remedial measures, if necessary. In 1997, the SFIA pursued a cost recovery action in the U.S. District Court of Northern California against certain airport tenants to recover past and future costs associated with historic airport contamination. American entered an initial settlement for accrued past costs in 2000 for $850,000. In 2004, American resolved its liability for all remaining past and future costs. Based on SFIA\\x92s cost projections, the value of American\\x92s second settlement is approximately $4 million payable over a 30 year period. Miami-Dade County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating various environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery methods. American and AMR Eagle have been named PRPs for the contamination at MIA. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 6 Table of Contents In 1999, American was ordered by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) to conduct remediation of environmental contamination located at Terminals 8 and 9 at JFK. American is seeking to recover a portion of the JFK remediation costs from previous users of the Terminals 8 and 9 premises. In 2004, American entered a Consent Order with NYSDEC for the remediation of a JFK off-terminal hangar facility. American expects that the projected costs associated with the JFK remediations will be immaterial. In 1996, American and Executive, along with other tenants at the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU) were notified by the SJU Port Authority that it considered them potentially responsible for environmental contamination at the airport. In 2003, the SJU Port Authority requested that American, among other airport tenants, fund an ongoing subsurface investigation and site assessment. American denied liability for the related costs. No further action has been taken against American or Executive. American Eagle has been notified of its potential liability under New York law at an inactive hazardous waste site in Poughkeepsie, New York. Pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent entered into with NYSDEC, American Eagle is implementing a final remedy to address contamination at the site. The costs of this final remedy are immaterial. The Company does not expect these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material adverse impact on the Company. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Labor The airline business is labor intensive. Wages, salaries and benefits represented approximately 32 percent of the Company\\x92s consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005. The average full-time equivalent number of employees of the Company\\x92s subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 88,400. The majority of these employees are represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Relations with such labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under this act, the collective bargaining agreements among the Company\\x92s subsidiaries and these organizations generally do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (NMB) to appoint a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day \\x93cooling off\\x94 period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties\\x92 positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another \\x93cooling off\\x94 period of 30 days. At the end of a \\x93cooling off\\x94 period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to \\x93self-help\\x94, including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. In April 2003, American reached agreements with its three major unions \\x97 the Allied Pilots Association (the APA), the Transport Workers Union of America (AFL-CIO) (the TWU) and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (the APFA) (the Labor Agreements). The Labor Agreements substantially reduced the labor costs associated with the employees represented by the unions. In conjunction with the Labor Agreements, American implemented various changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-unionized personnel, including officers and other management (the Management Reductions). While the parties may begin contract discussions in 2006 under the Labor Agreements, the agreements do not become amendable until 2008. 7 Table of Contents The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents American Eagle pilots, reached agreement with American Eagle effective September 1, 1997, to have all of the pilots of the American Eagle® carriers covered by a single contract. This agreement lasts until October 31, 2013. The agreement provides to the parties the right to seek limited changes in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. If the parties are unable to agree on the limited changes, the agreement provides that any issues would be resolved by interest arbitration, without the exercise of self-help (such as a strike). ALPA and American Eagle negotiated a tentative agreement in 2000, but that agreement failed in ratification. Thereafter, the parties participated in interest arbitration. The interest arbitration panel determined the limited changes that should be made and these changes were appropriately effected. In 2004, the parties successfully negotiated limited changes that became effective on January 1, 2005. The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), which represents the flight attendants of the American Eagle carriers, reached agreement with American Eagle effective March 2, 1998, to have all flight attendants of the American Eagle carriers covered by a single contract. The agreement became amendable on September 2, 2001. The parties agreed to commence negotiations in March 2001. Thereafter, the mediation assistance of the NMB was requested and mediation commenced in November 2003. The parties reached an agreement that was ratified by the membership in October 2005. The new agreement is amendable on October 27, 2009; however, the parties have agreed that contract openers may be exchanged 90 days prior to that date. The other union employees at the American Eagle carriers are covered by separate agreements with the TWU, which were effective April 28, 1998, and were amendable April 28, 2003. American Eagle and the TWU reached agreements with respect to the TWU-represented work groups at various times in late 2004 and early 2005. The new agreements are amendable beginning with dates ranging from October 1, 2007 to January 26, 2008; however, the parties have agreed that contract openers may be exchanged at least 60 days prior to October 1, 2007. Fuel The Company\\x92s operations and financial results are significantly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel. The Company\\x92s fuel costs and consumption for the years 2003 through 2005 were: Average Percent of Gallons Cost Per AMR\\x92s Consumed Total Cost Gallon Operating Year (in millions) (in millions) (in cents) Expenses 2003 3,161 $ 2,772 87.7 15.2 2004 3,264 3,969 121.6 21.1 2005 3,237 5,615 173.5 27.0 The impact of fuel price changes on the Company and its competitors depends on various factors, including hedging strategies. The Company has a fuel hedging program in which it enters into jet fuel, heating oil and crude oil hedging contracts to dampen the impact of the volatility of jet fuel prices. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company\\x92s fuel hedging program reduced the Company\\x92s fuel expense by approximately $64 million, $99 million and $149 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had hedged, with option contracts, including collars, approximately 17 percent of its estimated 2006 fuel requirements and insignificant amounts of its estimated fuel requirements thereafter. The consumption hedged for 2006 is capped at an average price of approximately $60 per barrel of crude oil. A deterioration of the Company\\x92s financial position could negatively affect the Company\\x92s ability to hedge fuel in the future. See the Risk Factors under Item 1A for additional information regarding fuel. Additional information regarding the Company\\x92s fuel program is also included in Item 7(A) \\x96 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents Frequent Flyer Program American established the AAdvantage frequent flyer program (AAdvantage) to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage. The Company believes that the AAdvantage program is one of its competitive strengths. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American or American Eagle, or by using services of other program participants, including bank credit card issuers, hotels, car rental companies and other retail companies. American sells mileage credits and related services to the other companies participating in the program. American reserves the right to change the AAdvantage program at any time without notice and may end the program with six months notice. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle or other participating airlines, or for other travel industry awards. Once a member accrues sufficient mileage for an award, the member may book award travel. Most travel awards are subject to capacity controlled seating. Mileage credit does not expire, provided a customer has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 36 months. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates under Item 7 for more information on AAdvantage. Other Matters Seasonality and Other Factors The Company\\x92s results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year, since the air transportation business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Higher demand for air travel has traditionally resulted in more favorable operating and financial results for the second and third quarters of the year than for the first and fourth quarters. Fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Unaudited quarterly financial data for the two-year period ended December 31, 2005 is included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the results of operations in the air transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic conditions. No material part of the business of AMR and its subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. Consequently, the loss of the Company\\x92s largest few customers would not have a materially adverse effect upon the Company. Insurance The Company carries insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft. As a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (the Terrorist Attacks), aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in general. The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines until August 31, 2006 covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. In addition, the Secretary of Transportation may extend the policy until December 31, 2006, at his discretion. However, there is no assurance that it will be extended. If the U.S. government does not extend the policy beyond August 31, 2006, the Company will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower scope from commercial insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is not available at commercially reasonable rates, the Company would be adversely affected. While the price of commercial insurance has declined since the premium increases immediately after the Terrorist Attacks, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to the Company, or significantly increase its cost, the Company would be adversely affected. 9 Table of Contents Other Government Matters In time of war or during a national emergency or defense oriented situation, American and other air carriers can be required to provide airlift services to the Air Mobility Command under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program. In the event the Company has to provide a substantial number of aircraft and crew to the Air Mobility Command, its operations could be adversely impacted. The Company currently receives compensation for participating in the program, even though it is not providing airlift services to the U.S. Government at this time. Available Information The Company makes its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 available free of charge under the Investor Relations page on its website, www.aa.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Company\\x92s code of ethics, which applies to all employees of the Company, including the Company\\x92s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Controller, is posted under the Investor Relations page on its website, www.aa.com. The Company intends to disclose any amendments to the code of ethics, or waivers of the code of ethics on behalf of the CEO, CFO or Controller, under the Investor Relations page on the Company\\x92s website, www.aa.com. The charters for the AMR Board of Directors\\x92 standing committees (the Audit, Compensation, Diversity and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees) as well as the Board of Directors\\x92 Governance Policies (the Governance Policies) are likewise available on the Company\\x92s website, www.aa.com. Upon request, copies of the charters or the Governance Policies are available at no cost. Information on the Company\\x92s website is not incorporated into or a part of this Report. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our ability to become profitable and our ability to continue to fund our obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond our control. Some of the factors that may have a negative impact on us are described below: As a result of significant losses in recent years, our financial condition has been materially weakened. We have incurred significant losses in recent years: $861 million in 2005, $761 million in 2004, $1.2 billion in 2003, $3.5 billion in 2002 and $1.8 billion in 2001. As a result, our financial condition has been materially weakened, and we remain vulnerable both to unexpected events (such as additional terrorist attacks or a sudden spike in jet fuel prices) and to general declines in the operating environment (such as that resulting from a recession or significant increased competition). Our initiatives to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce our costs may not be adequate or successful. As we seek to improve our financial condition, we must continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and to significantly reduce our costs. Although we have a number of initiatives underway to address our cost and revenue challenges, a number of these initiatives involve significant changes to our business which we may be unable to implement. The adequacy and ultimate success of our initiatives to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce our costs are not known at this time and cannot be assured. Moreover, whether our initiatives will be adequate or successful depends in large measure on factors beyond our control, notably the overall industry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry capacity growth, and fuel prices. It will be very difficult, absent continued restructuring of our operations, for us to continue to fund our obligations on an ongoing basis, or to become profitable, if the overall industry revenue environment does not continue to improve and fuel prices remain at historically high levels for an extended period. Our business is affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, and our results of operations tend to be volatile. Our business, and that of the rest of the airline industry, is affected by many changing economic and other conditions largely outside of our control, including among others: \\x95 actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation and higher interest rates, war, terrorist attacks or political instability; \\x95 changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic trends; \\x95 actual or potential disruptions to the air traffic control system; \\x95 increases in costs of safety, security and environmental measures; \\x95 outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; or \\x95 weather and natural disasters. As a result, our results of operations tend to be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, many of the factors that can have a material impact on our business and our results of operations are beyond our control. 11 Table of Contents Our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could adversely affect our business and liquidity. We have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness and obligations to make future payments on aircraft equipment and property leases. We may incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and lease obligations in the future. We also have substantial, and increasing, pension funding obligations. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, they could: \\x95 limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes, or adversely affect the terms on which such financing could be obtained; \\x95 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes; \\x95 make us more vulnerable to economic downturns; \\x95 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions; or \\x95 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. We may be unable to comply with our financial covenants. American has a fully drawn $788 million Credit Facility, which consists of a $540 million Revolving Facility with a final maturity on June 17, 2009 and a $248 million Term Loan Facility with a final maturity on December 17, 2010. The Credit Facility contains a liquidity covenant and a ratio of cash flow to fixed charges covenant. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2005 and expect to be able to continue to comply with these covenants for the period ending March 31, 2006. However, given the historically high price of fuel and the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, it is difficult to assess whether we will, in fact, be able to continue to comply with these covenants, and there are no assurances that we will be able to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the Credit Facility which - - if we did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default \\x97 - could result in a default under a significant amount of our other debt and lease obligations, and otherwise adversely affect our business. We are being adversely affected by increases in fuel prices, and we would be adversely affected by disruptions in the supply of fuel. Our results are very significantly affected by the price and availability of jet fuel. Fuel prices increased significantly in 2005 and remain high. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, we may not be able to pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares. In fact, recent history would indicate that we have limited ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel. If fuel prices decline in the future, increased fare competition and lower revenues may offset any potential benefit of lower fuel prices. While we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability, dependency on foreign imports of crude oil, limited refining capacity and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel. If there is an outbreak of hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere or a reduction in refining capacity (due to weather events, for example), there could be reductions in the supply of jet fuel and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel. Major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases in its cost, or a continuation of current high prices for a significant period of time, would adversely affect our business. While we seek to manage the price risk of fuel costs by using derivative contracts, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particular level of protection against increased fuel costs. In addition, a deterioration of our financial position could negatively affect our ability to enter into derivative contracts in the future. 12 Table of Contents The airline industry is fiercely competitive and fares are at historically low levels. Service over almost all of our routes is highly competitive and fares remain at historically low levels. We face vigorous, and in some cases, increasing competition from major domestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign air carriers, LCCs, and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation. We also face increasing and significant competition from marketing/operational alliances formed by our competitors. In addition, the competitive landscape we face would be altered substantially by industry consolidation, including merger, equity investment and joint venture transactions. The percentage of routes on which we compete with carriers having substantially lower operating costs than ours has grown significantly over the past decade, and we now compete with LCCs on 75 percent of our domestic network. Certain alliances have been granted immunity from anti-trust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to effectively compete may be hindered. Pricing decisions are significantly affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we must generally match competitors\\x92 fares, since failing to match would result in even less revenue. More recently, we have faced increased competition from carriers with simplified fare structures, which are generally preferred by travelers. Any fare reduction or fare simplification initiative may not be offset by increases in passenger traffic, a reduction in costs or changes in the mix of traffic that would improve yields. Moreover, decisions by our competitors that increase \\x96 or reduce \\x96 overall industry capacity, or capacity dedicated to a particular domestic or foreign region, market or route, can have a material impact on related fare levels. We compete with reorganized and reorganizing carriers, which may result in competitive disadvantages for us or fare discounting. We must compete with air carriers that have recently reorganized or are reorganizing, including under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, including United, the second largest U.S. air carrier, Delta, the third largest U.S. air carrier and Northwest, the fourth largest U.S. air carrier. It is possible that other competitors may seek to reorganize in or out of Chapter 11. With the Chapter 11 filings of Delta and Northwest, two out of the four largest U.S. air carriers are now operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, with United just having emerged from Chapter 11. We cannot reliably predict the outcome of these proceedings or the consequences of such a large portion of the airline industry\\x92s capacity being provided by bankrupt or recently reorganized air carriers. Successful reorganizations by other carriers present us with competitors with significantly lower operating costs and a stronger financial position derived from renegotiated labor, supply, and financing contracts, which could lead to fare reductions. These competitive pressures may limit our ability to adequately price our services, may require us to further reduce our operating costs, and could have a material adverse impact on us. Our reduced pricing power adversely affects our ability to achieve adequate pricing, especially with respect to business travel. Our passenger yield remains depressed by historical standards. We believe this depressed passenger yield is due in large part to a corresponding decline in our pricing power. Our reduced pricing power is the product of several factors including: greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers (particularly business travelers); pricing transparency resulting from the use of the Internet; greater competition from LCCs and from carriers that have recently reorganized or are reorganizing including under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; other carriers being well hedged against rising fuel costs and able to better absorb the current high jet fuel prices; and, more recently, fare simplification efforts by certain carriers. We believe that our reduced pricing power will persist indefinitely and possibly permanently. 13 Table of Contents We need to raise additional funds to maintain sufficient liquidity, but we may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. To maintain sufficient liquidity as we continue to implement our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, and because we have significant debt, lease, pension and other obligations in the next several years, we will need continued access to additional funding. Our ability to obtain future financing has been reduced because we have fewer unencumbered assets available than in years past. A very large majority of our aircraft assets (including virtually all of the aircraft eligible for the benefits of Section 1110 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) have been encumbered. Also, the market value of our aircraft assets has declined in recent years and those assets may not maintain their current market value. Since the Terrorist Attacks, our credit ratings have been lowered to significantly below investment grade. These reductions have increased our borrowing costs and otherwise adversely affected borrowing terms, and limited borrowing options. Additional reductions in our credit ratings could further increase borrowing or other costs and further restrict the availability of future financing. A number of other factors, including our recent financial results, our substantial indebtedness, the difficult revenue environment we face, our reduced credit ratings, high fuel prices, and the financial difficulties experienced in the airline industry, adversely affect the availability and terms of financing for us. As a result, there can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain our operations over the long term. Our business strategy may change. We evaluate our assets on an ongoing basis with a view to maximizing their value to us and determining which are core to our operations. We also regularly evaluate our business strategy. We may change our business strategy in the future and may not pursue our current goals. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which can result in increases in our costs, limits on our operating flexibility and competitive disadvantages. Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Many of these requirements result in significant costs. For example, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft, and compliance with those requirements drives significant expenditures. In addition, the ability of U.S. carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the United States and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, or because appropriate slots or facilities are not made available. Moreover, additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been enacted from time to time that have significantly increased the costs of airline operations, reduced the demand for air travel or restricted the way we can conduct our business. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which became law in 2001, mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airlines. Similar laws or regulations or other governmental actions in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results. 14 Table of Contents Our results of operations may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies having jurisdiction over our operations, including: \\x95 changes in the law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports; \\x95 the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed for codesharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines; \\x95 restrictions on competitive practices (for example court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an airline\\x92s ability to respond to a competitor); \\x95 the adoption of regulations that impact customer service standards (for example new passenger security standards); or \\x95 the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions. In November 2005, the United States and the European Union reached a tentative air services agreement that would provide airlines from the United States and E.U. member states open access to each other\\x92s markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly beyond the United States and both within and beyond the E.U. The tentative agreement is subject to approval by the E.U. Transport Council of Ministers. Under the agreement, every U.S. and E.U. airline would be authorized to operate between airports in the United States and London\\x92s Heathrow Airport. Only three airlines besides American are currently allowed to provide that service and Heathrow routes have historically been among our most profitable. The agreement, if approved, would result in our facing increased competition in serving Heathrow if additional carriers are able to obtain necessary slots and terminal facilities. We currently serve the Dallas/Fort Worth area solely from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Southwest Airlines is actively seeking repeal of the Wright Amendment, which is a law that authorizes flight operations at Dallas Love Field within limited geographic areas. In November 2005, legislation was passed that added the State of Missouri to the areas that may be served to and from Love Field, and we subsequently announced that we plan to provide service at Love Field in order to protect market share. Splitting our Dallas/Fort Worth operations between DFW and Love Field impairs the efficiency and profitability of our hub operations at DFW, and further expansion of the authorized geographic service areas could have an adverse financial impact on us. We could be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks. The increased threat of U.S. military involvement in overseas operations has, on occasion, had an adverse impact on our business, financial position (including access to capital markets) and results of operations, and on the airline industry in general. Furthermore, during 2003, the war in Iraq had a significant adverse impact on international and domestic revenues and future bookings. The continuing conflict in Iraq, or other conflicts or events in the Middle East or elsewhere, may result in similar adverse impacts. The Terrorist Attacks had a material adverse impact on us. The occurrence of another terrorist attack (whether domestic or international and whether against us or another entity) could again have a material adverse impact on us. Our international operations could be adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control. Our current international activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such as reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls, currency and political risks, taxation and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots. 15 Table of Contents We could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior. In 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which primarily had an adverse impact on our Asia operations. More recently, there have been concerns about a potential outbreak of avian flu. If there were another outbreak of a disease (such as SARS or avian flu) that affects travel behavior, it could have a material adverse impact on us. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relations with any unionized or other employee work group. Our operations could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with any labor union representing our employees. In addition, any dispute we have with, or any disruption by, an employee work group (outside the confines of a collective bargaining agreement) could adversely impact us. Moreover, one of the fundamental tenets of our strategic Turnaround Plan is increased union and employee involvement in our operations. To the extent we are unable to maintain satisfactory relations with any unionized or other employee work group, our ability to execute our strategic plans would be adversely affected. Our insurance costs have increased substantially and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have an adverse impact on us. We carry insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to our aircraft. As a result of the Terrorist Attacks, aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in general. The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines until August 31, 2006, covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. In addition, the Secretary of Transportation may extend the policy until December 31, 2006, at his discretion. However, there is no assurance that it will be extended. If the U.S. government does not extend the policy beyond August 31, 2006, we will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower scope from commercial insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is not available at commercially reasonable rates, we would be adversely affected. While the price of commercial insurance has declined since the premium increase immediately after the Terrorist Attacks, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to us, or significantly increase its cost, we would be adversely affected. We may be unable to retain key management personnel. Since the Terrorist Attacks, several of our key management employees have elected to retire early or leave for more financially favorable opportunities at other companies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key management employees. Any inability to retain our key management employees, or attract and retain additional qualified management employees, could have a negative impact on us. We could be adversely affected by a failure or disruption of our computer, communications or other technology systems. We are increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business. The computer and communications systems on which we rely could be disrupted due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment failures, software failures and computer viruses and hackers. We have taken certain steps to help reduce the risk of some (but not all) of these potential disruptions. There can be no assurance, however, that the measures we have taken are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions or failures of these systems. Any substantial or repeated failure of these systems could impact our operations and customer service, result in the loss of important data, loss of revenues, increased costs and generally harm our business. Moreover, a catastrophic failure of certain of our vital systems (which we believe is a remote possibility) could limit our ability to operate our flights for an indefinite period of time, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and our business. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.

Of these 27 aircraft, 13 are owned by the Company, six are accounted for as capital leases and eight are accounted for as operating leases. American has leased its Boeing 777-200 not operated by the Company to The Boeing Company for a period of up to twelve months beginning in December 2005. AMR Eagle has leased its 10 owned Embraer 145s not operated by the Company to Trans States Airlines, Inc.

Ground Properties The Company leases, or has built as leasehold improvements on leased property: most of its airport and terminal facilities; its training facilities in Fort Worth, Texas; its principal overhaul and maintenance bases at Tulsa International Airport (Tulsa, Oklahoma), Kansas City International Airport (Kansas City, Missouri) and Alliance Airport (Fort Worth, Texas); its headquarters building in Fort Worth, Texas; its regional reservation offices; and local ticket and administration offices throughout the system. American has entered into agreements with the Tulsa Municipal Airport Trust; the Alliance Airport Authority, Fort Worth, Texas; the New York City Industrial Development Agency; and the Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago O\\x92Hare, Newark, San Juan, and Los Angeles airport authorities to provide funds for constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring equipment which are or will be leased to the Company. The Company also uses public airports for its flight operations under lease or use arrangements with the municipalities or governmental agencies owning or controlling them and leases certain other ground equipment for use at its facilities.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On July 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in November 1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR, American, AMR Eagle, Airlines Reporting Corporation, and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division (Westways World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp., et al.). The lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos to American for violations of American\\x92s fare rules (by customers of the agencies): (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American and AMR Eagle and the plaintiffs; (2) constitutes unjust enrichment; and (3) violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). On July 9, 2003, the court certified a class that included all travel agencies who have been or will be required to pay money to American for debit memos for fare rules violations from July 26, 1995 to the present. The plaintiffs sought to enjoin American from enforcing the pricing rules in question and to recover the amounts paid for debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys\\x92 fees and costs. On February 24, 2005, the court decertified the class. The claims against Airlines Reporting Corporation have been dismissed, and in September 2005, the Court granted Summary Judgment in favor of the Company and all other defendants. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision could impose restrictions on the Company\\x92s relationships with travel agencies, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Between April 3, 2003 and June 5, 2003, three lawsuits were filed by travel agents some of whom opted out of a prior class action (now dismissed) to pursue their claims individually against American, other airline defendants, and in one case against certain airline defendants and Orbitz LLC. (Tam Travel et. al., v. Delta Air Lines et. al., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California \\x96 San Francisco (51 individual agencies), Paula Fausky d/b/a Timeless Travel v. American Airlines, et. al, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio Eastern Division (29 agencies) and Swope Travel et al. v. Orbitz et. al. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division (6 agencies)). Collectively, these lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief alleging that the certain airline defendants and Orbitz LLC: (i) conspired to prevent travel agents from acting as effective competitors in the distribution of airline tickets to passengers in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act; (ii) conspired to monopolize the distribution of common carrier air travel between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; and that (iii) between 1995 and the present, the airline defendants conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. These cases have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. American is vigorously defending these lawsuits. A final adverse court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on the Company\\x92s distribution practices would have a material adverse impact on the Company. On August 19, 2002, a class action lawsuit seeking monetary damages was filed, and on May 7, 2003, an amended complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Power Travel International, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., et al.) against American, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Northwest Airlines, alleging that American and the other defendants breached their contracts with the agency and were unjustly enriched when these carriers at various times reduced their base commissions to zero. The as yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies accredited by the Airlines Reporting Corporation \\x93whose base commissions on airline tickets were unilaterally reduced to zero by\\x94 the defendants. The claims against Delta Air Lines have been dismissed, and the case is stayed as to United Airlines and Northwest Airlines since they filed for bankruptcy. American is vigorously defending the lawsuit. Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision awarding substantial money damages or forcing the Company to pay agency commissions would have an adverse impact on the Company. 20 Table of Contents Miami-Dade County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating various environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery methods. American and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) for the contamination at MIA. During the second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover its past and future cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo Services, Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit Court). The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit. In addition to the 17 defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and contributors to the contamination. The case is currently stayed while the parties pursue an alternative dispute resolution process. The County has proposed draft allocation models for remedial costs for the Terminal and Tank Farm areas of MIA. While it is anticipated that American and AMR Eagle will be allocated equitable shares of remedial costs, the Company does not expect the allocated amounts to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Four cases (each being a purported class action) have been filed against American arising from the disclosure of passenger name records by a vendor of American. The cases are: Kimmell v. AMR, et al. (U. S. District Court, Texas), Baldwin v. AMR, et al. (U. S. District Court, Texas), Rosenberg v. AMR, et al. (U. S. District Court, New York) and Anapolsky v. AMR, et al. (U.S. District Court, New York). The Kimmell suit was filed in April 2004. The Baldwin and Rosenberg cases were filed in May 2004. The Anapolsky suit was filed in September 2004. The suits allege various causes of action, including but not limited to, violations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract and violation of alleged common law rights of privacy. In each case plaintiffs seek statutory damages of $1000 per passenger, plus additional unspecified monetary damages. The Court dismissed the cases but allowed leave to amend, and the plaintiffs in the Kimmell and Rosenberg cases filed amended complaints on June 24, 2005. The Company is vigorously defending these suits and believes the suits are without merit. However, a final adverse court decision awarding substantial money damages would have a material adverse impact on the Company. American is defending two lawsuits, filed as class actions but not certified as such, arising from allegedly improper failure to refund certain governmental taxes and fees collected by the Company upon the sale of nonrefundable tickets when such tickets are not used for travel. In Harrington v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., et al., (filed November 24, 2004 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts), the plaintiffs seek unspecified actual damages (trebled), declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys\\x92 fees. The suits assert various causes of action, including breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment against American and numerous other airline defendants. Additionally, the same attorneys representing the Harrington plaintiffs have filed a qui tam suit entitled Teitelbaum v. Alaska Airlines, et al. American was notified it is a defendant in this case in December 2005. This case, also pending in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asserts essentially the same claims (but also asserts that the United States has been damaged) and requests essentially the same relief on behalf of the United States. The Company is vigorously defending the suits and believes them to be without merit. However, a final adverse court decision requiring the Company to refund collected taxes and/or fees could have a material adverse impact on the Company. On March 11, 2004, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against AMR, American, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation, and American Eagle in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (IAP Intermodal, L.L.C. v. AMR Corp., et al.). The case was consolidated with eight similar lawsuits filed against a number of other unaffiliated airlines, including Continental, Northwest, British Airways, Air France, Pinnacle Airlines, Korean Air and Singapore Airlines (as well as various regional affiliates of the foregoing). The plaintiff alleges that the airline defendants infringe three patents, each of which relates to a system of scheduling vehicles based on freight and passenger transportation requests received from remote computer terminals. The plaintiff is seeking past and future royalties of over $30 billion dollars, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys\\x92 fees. On September 7, 2005, the court issued a memorandum opinion that interpreted disputed terms in the patents. The plaintiff dismissed its claims without prejudice to its right to appeal the September 7, 2005 opinion, and the plaintiff is pursuing such an appeal. Although the Company believes that the plaintiff\\x92s claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the lawsuit, a final adverse court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing material restrictions on existing scheduling practices would have a material adverse impact on the Company. 21 Table of Contents On July 12, 2004, a consolidated class action complaint, that was subsequently amended on November 30, 2004, was filed against American and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the Union which represents the Company\\x92s flight attendants (Ann M. Marcoux, et al., v. American Airlines Inc., et al. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York). While a class has not yet been certified, the lawsuit seeks on behalf of all of American\\x92s flight attendants or various subclasses to set aside, and to obtain damages allegedly resulting from, the April 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreement referred to as the Restructuring Participation Agreement (RPA). The RPA was one of three labor agreements the Company successfully reached with its unions in order to avoid filing for bankruptcy in 2003. In a related case (Sherry Cooper, et al. v. TWA Airlines, LLC, et al., also in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York), the court denied a preliminary injunction against implementation of the RPA on June 30, 2003. The Marcoux suit alleges various claims against the Union and American relating to the RPA and the ratification vote on the RPA by individual Union members, including: violation of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and the APFA\\x92s Constitution and By-laws, violation by the Union of its duty of fair representation to its members, violation by the Company of provisions of the Railway Labor Act through improper coercion of flight attendants into voting or changing their vote for ratification, and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). Although the Company believes the case against it is without merit and both the Company and the Union are vigorously defending the lawsuit, a final adverse court decision invalidating the RPA and awarding substantial money damages would have a material adverse impact on the Company. On February 14, 2006, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the \\x93DOJ\\x94) served the Company with a grand jury subpoena as part of an ongoing investigation into possible criminal violations of the antitrust laws by certain domestic and foreign air cargo carriers. At this time, the Company does not believe it is a target of the DOJ investigation. On February 22, 2006, the Company received a letter from the Swiss Competition Commission (the \\x93Commission\\x94) informing the Company that the Commission is investigating whether the Company and certain other cargo carriers entered into agreements relating to fuel surcharges, security surcharges, war risk surcharges, and customs clearance surcharges. The Company intends to cooperate fully with these investigations. In the event that these investigations uncover violations of the U.S. antitrust laws or the competition laws of some other jurisdiction, such findings and related legal proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Two purported class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company and certain foreign and domestic air carriers alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. antitrust laws by illegally conspiring to set prices and surcharges on cargo shipments (Animal Land, Inc. v. Air Canada et al., filed February 17, 2006, and Adams v. British Airways, et al, filed February 22, 2006, both of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York). Plaintiffs are seeking trebled money damages and injunctive relief. American will vigorously defend these lawsuits; however, any adverse judgment could have a material adverse impact on the Company. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT\\x92S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Information The discussions under Business, Risk Factors, Properties and Legal Proceedings and the following discussions under Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk contain various forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which represent the Company\\x92s expectations or beliefs concerning future events. When used in this document and in documents incorporated herein by reference, the words \\x93expects,\\x94 \\x93plans,\\x94 \\x93anticipates,\\x94 \\x93indicates,\\x94 \\x93believes,\\x94 \\x93forecast,\\x94 \\x93guidance,\\x94 \\x93outlook,\\x94 \\x93may,\\x94 \\x93will,\\x94 \\x93should,\\x94 and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the Company\\x92s expectations concerning operations and financial conditions, including changes in capacity, revenues, and costs, future financing plans and needs, overall economic conditions, plans and objectives for future operations, and the impact on the Company of its results of operations in recent years and the sufficiency of its financial resources to absorb that impact. Other forward-looking statements include statements which do not relate solely to historical facts, such as, without limitation, statements which discuss the possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information available to the Company on the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. The Risk Factors listed in Item 1A, in addition to other possible factors not listed, could cause the Company\\x92s actual results to differ materially from historical results and from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Overview The Company has incurred very large operating and net losses during the past five years, as shown in the following table: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Operating loss $ (93 ) $ (144 ) $ (844 ) $ (3,330 ) $ (2,470 ) Net loss (861 ) (761 ) (1,228 ) (3,511 ) (1,762 ) These losses reflect, among other things, a substantial decrease in the Company\\x92s revenues in 2001 and 2002. This revenue decrease was primarily driven by (i) a steep fall-off in the demand for air travel, particularly business travel, primarily caused by weakness in the U.S. economy, (ii) reduced pricing power, resulting mainly from greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers (especially business travelers), increasing competition from LCCs, and the use of the Internet and (iii) the aftermath of the Terrorist Attacks, which accelerated and exacerbated the trend of decreased demand and reduced industry revenues. Subsequent to 2002, passenger traffic significantly improved, reflecting a general economic improvement. In 2005, mainline passenger load factor increased 3.8 points year-over-year to 78.6 percent. In addition, mainline passenger revenue yield began rebounding in 2005 and increased 4.0 percent year-over-year. However, passenger revenue yield remains depressed by historical standards. The Company believes this depressed passenger yield is the result of its reduced pricing power resulting from the factors listed in clause (ii) above, and other factors, which the Company believes will persist indefinitely and possibly permanently. 26 Table of Contents The Company\\x92s 2004 and 2005 financial results were also adversely affected by significant increases in the price of jet fuel. The average price per gallon of fuel increased 33.9 cents from 2003 to 2004 and 51.9 cents from 2004 to 2005. These price increases negatively impacted fuel expense by $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Continuing high fuel prices, additional increases in the price of fuel, and/or disruptions in the supply of fuel, would further adversely affect the Company\\x92s financial condition and its results of operations. In response to the challenges faced by the Company, during the past five years the Company has implemented several restructuring and other initiatives: \\x95 Following the Terrorist Attacks, the Company reduced its operating schedule by approximately 20 percent and reduced its workforce by approximately 20,000 jobs. \\x95 In 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its annual costs by $2 billion. These initiatives involved: (i) scheduling efficiencies, (ii) fleet simplification, (iii) streamlined customer interaction, (iv) distribution modifications, (v) in-flight product changes, (vi) operational changes and (vii) headquarters/administration efficiencies. As a result of these initiatives, the Company reduced an estimated 7,000 jobs by March 2003. \\x95 In February 2003, American asked its employees for approximately $1.8 billion in annual savings through a combination of changes in wages, benefits and work rules. In April 2003, American reached agreements with its three unions (the Labor Agreements) and also implemented various changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-unionized personnel, including officers and other management (the Management Reductions). The Labor Agreements and Management Reductions resulted in an estimated $1.8 billion in annual savings and included a workforce reduction of approximately 9,300 jobs. In addition, the Company and American reached concessionary agreements with certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers (collectively, the Vendors, and the agreements, the Vendor Agreements), resulting in an estimated $200 million in annual cost savings. Generally, under the terms of these Vendor Agreements, the Company or American received the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods and services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect to certain of its aircraft. \\x95 Subsequent to the April 2003 Labor Agreements and Management Reductions, the Company announced the Turnaround Plan. The Turnaround Plan is the Company\\x92s strategic framework for returning to sustained profitability and emphasizes: (i) lower costs, (ii) an increased focus on what customers\\x92 truly value and are prepared to pay for, (iii) increased union and employee involvement in the operation of the Company and (iv) the need for a more sound balance sheet and financial structure. \\x95 Subsequent to the announcement of the Turnaround Plan, the Company has worked with its unions and employees to identify and implement additional initiatives designed to increase efficiencies and revenues and reduce costs. These initiatives included: (i) the return of under-used gate space and the consolidation of terminal space, (ii) the de-peaking of its hub at Miami, the reduction in the size of its St. Louis hub and the simplification of its domestic operations, (iii) the acceleration of the retirement of certain aircraft and the cancellation or deferral of aircraft deliveries, (iv) the improvement of aircraft utilization across its fleet and an increase in seating density on certain fleet types, (v) the sale of certain non-core assets, (vi) the expansion of its international network, where the Company believes that higher revenue generating opportunities currently exist, (vii) the implementation of an on-board food purchase program and new fees for ticketing and baggage services, (viii) lower distribution costs, (ix) the implementation of fuel conservation initiatives, (x) the increase in third-party maintenance contracts obtained by the Company\\x92s Maintenance and Engineering group, (xi) upgrading of flight navigation systems to provide more direct routings and (xii) numerous other initiatives. \\x95 As part of its effort to build greater employee involvement, the Company has sought to make its labor unions and its employees its business partners in working for continuous improvement under the Turnaround Plan. Among other things, the senior management of the Company meets regularly with union officials to discuss the Company\\x92s financial results as well as the competitive landscape. These discussions include (i) the Company\\x92s own cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiatives, (ii) a review of initiatives, in-place or contemplated, at other airlines and the impact of those initiatives on the Company\\x92s competitive position, and (iii) benchmarking the Company\\x92s revenues and costs against what would be considered \\x93best in class\\x94 (the Company\\x92s Performance Leadership Initiative). 27 Table of Contents These initiatives have significantly improved the Company\\x92s cost structure and resulted in the Company achieving what the Company believes to be the lowest unit costs of the traditional carriers in 2004. However, a significant number of the Company\\x92s competitors have recently reorganized or are reorganizing, including under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, including Delta, United, US Airways and Northwest. These competitors are significantly reducing their cost structures through bankruptcy, resulting in the Company\\x92s cost structure once again becoming less competitive. The Company\\x92s ability to become profitable and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely beyond the Company\\x92s control. Some of the risk factors that affect the Company\\x92s business and financial results are discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A. As the Company seeks to improve its financial condition, it must continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce its costs. Although the Company has a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and revenue challenges, the ultimate success of these initiatives is not known at this time and cannot be assured. It will be very difficult, absent continued restructuring of its operations, for the Company to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, or to become profitable, if the overall industry revenue environment does not continue to improve and fuel prices remain at historically high levels for an extended period. 28 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Assets At December 31, 2005, the Company had $3.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and $510 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Significant Indebtedness and Future Financing Substantial indebtedness is a significant risk to the Company as discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A. During 2003, 2004 and 2005, in addition to refinancing its Credit Facility and certain debt with an institutional investor (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company raised an aggregate of approximately $4.5 billion of financing to fund capital commitments (mainly for aircraft and ground properties) and operating losses and to bolster its liquidity. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company believes that it should have sufficient liquidity to fund its operations for the foreseeable future, including repayment of debt and capital leases, capital expenditures and other contractual obligations. However, to maintain sufficient liquidity as the Company continues to implement its restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, and because the Company has significant debt, lease and other obligations in the next several years, as well as substantial pension funding obligations (refer to Contractual Obligations in this Item 7), the Company will need access to additional funding. The Company\\x92s possible financing sources primarily include: (i) a limited amount of additional secured aircraft debt (a very large majority of the Company\\x92s owned aircraft, including virtually all of the Company\\x92s Section 1110-eligible aircraft, are encumbered) or sale-leaseback transactions involving owned aircraft, (ii) debt secured by new aircraft deliveries, (iii) debt secured by other assets, (iv) securitization of future operating receipts, (v) the sale or monetization of certain assets, (vi) unsecured debt and (vii) equity and/or equity-like securities. However, the availability and level of these financing sources cannot be assured, particularly in light of the Company\\x92s and American\\x92s recent financial results, substantial indebtedness, reduced credit ratings, high fuel prices, historically weak revenues and the financial difficulties being experienced in the airline industry. The inability of the Company to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on the ability of the Company to sustain its operations over the long-term. Credit Ratings AMR\\x92s and American\\x92s credit ratings are significantly below investment grade. Additional reductions in AMR\\x92s or American\\x92s credit ratings could further increase its borrowing or other costs and further restrict the availability of future financing. Credit Facility Covenants American has a credit facility consisting of a fully drawn $540 million senior secured revolving credit facility, with a final maturity on June 17, 2009, and a fully drawn $248 million term loan facility, with a final maturity on December 17, 2010 (the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility, respectively, and collectively, the Credit Facility). American\\x92s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by AMR. 29 Table of Contents The Credit Facility contains a covenant (the Liquidity Covenant) requiring American to maintain, as defined, unrestricted cash, unencumbered short term investments and amounts available for drawing under committed revolving credit facilities of not less than $1.25 billion for each quarterly period through the remaining life of the credit facility. American was in compliance with the Liquidity Covenant as of December 31, 2005 and expects to be able to continue to comply with this covenant. In addition, the Credit Facility contains a covenant (the EBITDAR Covenant) requiring AMR to maintain a ratio of cash flow (defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense (less capitalized interest), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals, adjusted for certain gains or losses and non-cash items) to fixed charges (comprising interest expense (less capitalized interest) and rentals). AMR was in compliance with the EBITDAR covenant as of December 31, 2005 and expects to be able to continue to comply with this covenant for the period ending March 31, 2006. However, given the historically high price of fuel and the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, it is difficult to assess whether AMR and American will, in fact, be able to continue to comply with the Liquidity Covenant and, in particular, the EBITDAR Covenant, and there are no assurances that AMR and American will be able to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the Credit Facility which - - if the Company did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default - - could result in a default under a significant amount of the Company\\x92s other debt and lease obligations and otherwise adversely affect the Company. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for the required ratios at each measurement date through the life of the Credit Facility. Cash Flow Activity The Company, or its subsidiaries, recorded the following debt (1) during the year ended December 31, 2005 (in millions): JFK Facilities Sublease Revenue Bonds, net (2) $ 491 Sale and leaseback of spare engines 133 Re-marketing of DFW-FIC Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2000A, maturing 2029 198 Various debt agreements related to the purchase of regional jet aircraft, net 319 $ 1,141 (1) The table does not include a transaction in which American purchased certain obligations due October 2006 with a face value of $261 million at par value from an institutional investor. In conjunction with the purchase, American borrowed an additional $245 million under an existing mortgage agreement with a final maturity in December 2012 from the same investor. (2) Amount shown is net of $207 million the Company will receive to fund future capital spending at JFK, $77 million held by a trustee for future debt service on the bonds and a discount of $25 million. See Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the debt issuances listed above. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company issued and sold 13 million shares of its common stock. The Company realized $223 million from the equity sale. 30 Table of Contents The Company\\x92s cash flow from operating activities improved in 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.0 billion, an increase of $307 million over 2004, due primarily to an improved revenue environment. Capital expenditures during 2005 were $681 million and primarily included the acquisition of 20 Embraer 145 aircraft and the cost of improvements at JFK. A portion of the improvements at JFK were reimbursed to the Company through a financing transaction discussed further above and in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. During 2004, the Company sold its remaining interest in Orbitz, resulting in total proceeds of $185 million and a gain of $146 million. Working Capital AMR (principally American) historically operates with a working capital deficit, as do most other airline companies. In addition, the Company has historically relied heavily on external financing to fund capital expenditures. More recently, the Company has also relied on external financing to fund operating losses. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements American has determined that it holds a significant variable interest in, but is not the primary beneficiary of, certain trusts that are the lessors under 84 of its aircraft operating leases. These leases contain a fixed price purchase option, which allows American to purchase the aircraft at a predetermined price on a specified date. However, American does not guarantee the residual value of the aircraft. As of December 31, 2005, future lease payments required under these leases totaled $2.6 billion. Certain special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased by American and accounted for as operating leases. Approximately $1.9 billion of these bonds (with total future payments of approximately $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2005) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both. Approximately $523 million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to repurchase the bonds at various times: $28 million in 2006, $100 million in 2007, $218 million in 2008, $112 million in 2014 and $65 million in 2015. Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce existing rent leveling accruals or be considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments. Approximately $198 million of special facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions were successfully remarketed in 2005. They were acquired by American in 2003 under a mandatory tender provision. Thus, the receipt by American of the proceeds from the remarketing in July 2005 resulted in an increase to Other liabilities and deferred credits where the tendered bonds had been classified pending their use to offset certain future operating lease obligations. In addition, the Company has other operating leases, primarily for aircraft and airport facilities, with total future lease payments of $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2005. Entering into aircraft leases allows the Company to obtain aircraft without immediate cash outflows. 31 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Company\\x92s obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Payments Due by Year(s) Ended December 31, 2007 2009 and and 2011 and Contractual Obligations Total 2006 2008 2010 Beyond Operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations 1 $ 12,217 $ 1,065 $ 2,012 $ 1,687 $ 7,453 Firm aircraft commitments 2 2,895 102 \\x97 \\x97 2,793 Capacity purchase agreements 3 237 90 129 18 \\x97 Long-term debt 4 20,644 1,924 3,472 4,108 11,140 Capital lease obligations 1,804 263 432 315 794 Other purchase obligations 5 1,563 376 420 307 460 Other long-term liabilities 6,7 2,234 196 407 433 1,198 Total obligations and commitments $ 41,594 $ 4,016 $ 6,872 $ 6,868 $ 23,838 1 Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities - which are supported by operating leases executed by American \\x97 are guaranteed by AMR and/or American. The special facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions discussed above are included in this table under their ultimate maturity date rather than their mandatory tender provision date. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 2 As of December 31, 2005, the Company had commitments to acquire two Boeing 777-200ERs in 2006; and an aggregate of 47 Boeing 737-800s and seven Boeing 777-200ERs in 2013 through 2016. The Company has pre-arranged backstop financing available for the aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2006. 3 The table reflects minimum required payments under capacity purchase contracts between American and two regional airlines, Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua) and Trans States Airlines Inc. If the Company terminates its contract with Chautauqua without cause, Chautauqua has the right to put its 15 Embraer aircraft to the Company. If this were to happen, the Company would take possession of the aircraft and become liable for lease obligations totaling approximately $21 million per year with lease expirations in 2018 and 2019. These lease obligations are not included in the table above. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 4 Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest. Interest on variable rate debt was estimated based on the current rate at December 31, 2005. 32 Table of Contents 5 Includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services, primarily construction related costs at JFK and information technology related support. Substantially all of our construction costs at JFK will be reimbursed through a fund established from a previous financing transaction. The Company has made estimates as to the timing of certain payments primarily for construction related costs. The actual timing of payments may vary from these estimates. Substantially all of the Company\\x92s purchase orders issued for other purchases in the ordinary course of business contain a 30-day cancellation clause that allows the Company to cancel an order with 30 days notice. 6 Includes expected other postretirement benefit payments through 2015. 7 Excludes a $2.3 billion accident liability, related to the Terrorist Attacks and flight 587, recorded in Other liabilities and deferred credits, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. This liability is offset in its entirety by a receivable, recorded in Other assets, which the Company expects to receive from insurance carriers as claims are resolved. Pension Obligations In addition to the commitments summarized above, the Company is required to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company\\x92s estimated 2006 contributions to its defined benefit pension plans are approximately $250 million. This estimate reflects the provisions of the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004. (The effect of the Pension Funding Equity Act was to defer to later years a portion of the minimum required contributions that would otherwise have been due for the 2004 and 2005 plan years.) Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Company\\x92s defined benefit plans are underfunded as of December 31, 2005 by $3.2 billion based on the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) and by $2.3 billion based on the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) (refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company\\x92s funded status at December 31, 2005 under the relevant ERISA funding standard is similar to its funded status using the ABO methodology. Due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to its defined benefit pension plans, such as interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns, and, in particular, the impact of proposed legislation currently pending the reconciliation process of the U.S. Congress, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate its future required contributions beyond 2006. However, absent significant legislative relief or significant favorable changes in market conditions, or both, the Company could be required to fund in 2007 a majority of the underfunded balance under the relevant ERISA funding standard. Even with significant legislative relief (including proposed airline-specific relief), the Company\\x92s 2007 required minimum contributions are expected to be higher than the Company\\x92s 2006 contributions. Results of Operations The Company incurred an $861 million net loss in 2005 compared to a net loss of $761 million in 2004. The Company\\x92s 2005 results were impacted by the continuing increase in fuel prices and certain other costs, offset by an improvement in revenues, a $108 million decrease in depreciation expense related to a change in the depreciable lives of certain aircraft types described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, and productivity improvements and other cost reductions resulting from progress under the Turnaround Plan. The Company\\x92s 2005 results were also impacted by a $155 million aircraft charge, a $73 million facility charge, an $80 million charge for the termination of a contract, a $37 million gain related to the resolution of a debt restructuring and a $22 million credit for the reversal of an insurance reserve. All of these amounts are included in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, except for a portion of the facility charge which is included in Other rentals and landing fees. Also included in the 2005 results was a $69 million fuel tax credit. Of this amount, $55 million is included in Aircraft fuel expense and $14 million is included in Interest income in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company\\x92s 2004 results include a $146 million gain on the sale of the Company\\x92s remaining investment in Orbitz that is included in Miscellaneous, net in the consolidated statement of operations and net restructuring charges of $11 million included in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the Company did not record a tax benefit associated with its 2005 or 2004 losses. 33 Table of Contents Revenues 2005 Compared to 2004 The Company\\x92s revenues increased approximately $2.1 billion, or 11.1 percent, to $20.7 billion in 2005 compared to 2004. American\\x92s passenger revenues increased by 10.6 percent, or $1.6 billion, on a capacity (available seat mile) (ASM) increase of 1.2 percent. American\\x92s passenger load factor increased 3.8 points to 78.6 percent and passenger revenue yield per passenger mile increased 4.0 percent to 12.01 cents. This resulted in an increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) of 9.3 percent to 9.43 cents. In 2005, American derived approximately 65 percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 35 percent from international operations. Following is additional information regarding American\\x92s domestic and international RASM and capacity: Year Ended December 31, 2005 RASM Y-O-Y ASMs Y-O-Y (cents) Change (billions) Change DOT Domestic 9.37 10.6 % 115 (2.3 )% International 9.56 6.6 61 8.6 DOT Latin America 9.48 7.9 30 6.0 DOT Atlantic 10.08 9.0 24 6.7 DOT Pacific 8.12 (7.7 ) 7 30.1 The Company\\x92s Regional Affiliates include two wholly owned subsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (collectively, AMR Eagle), and two independent carriers with which American has capacity purchase agreements, Trans States Airlines, Inc. (Trans States) and Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua). Regional Affiliates\\x92 passenger revenues, which are based on industry standard proration agreements for flights connecting to American flights, increased $272 million, or 14.5 percent, to $2.1 billion as a result of increased capacity and load factors. Regional Affiliates\\x92 traffic increased 22.8 percent to 8.9 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs), while capacity increased 17.3 percent to 12.7 billion ASMs, resulting in a 3.2 point increase in passenger load factor to 70.4 percent. Cargo revenues decreased 0.5 percent, or $3 million, primarily due to a 0.5 percent decrease in cargo revenue yield per ton mile. However, the cargo division saw a $49 million increase in fuel surcharges and other service fees. These amounts are included in Other revenues which are discussed below. Other revenues increased 18.3 percent, or $205 million, to $1.3 billion due in part to increased cargo fuel surcharges, increased third-party maintenance contracts obtained by the Company\\x92s maintenance and engineering group and increases in certain passenger fees. 34 Table of Contents 2004 Compared to 2003 The Company\\x92s revenues increased approximately $1.2 billion, or 6.9 percent, to $18.6 billion in 2004 compared to 2003. American\\x92s passenger revenues increased by 4.8 percent, or $689 million, on a capacity (available seat mile) (ASM) increase of 5.3 percent. American\\x92s passenger load factor increased 2.0 points to 74.8 percent while passenger revenue yield per passenger mile decreased by 3.1 percent to 11.54 cents. This resulted in a decrease in passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) of 0.5 percent to 8.63 cents. In 2004, American derived approximately 66 percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 34 percent from international operations. Following is additional information regarding American\\x92s domestic and international RASM and capacity: Year Ended December 31, 2004 RASM Y-O-Y ASMs Y-O-Y (cents) Change (billions) Change DOT Domestic 8.47 (2.1 )% 118 1.1 % International 8.97 2.8 56 15.4 DOT Latin America 8.78 (3.3 ) 28 18.6 DOT Atlantic 9.25 8.4 23 9.1 DOT Pacific 8.79 14.9 5 27.7 Regional Affiliates\\x92 passenger revenues, which are based on industry standard proration agreements for flights connecting to American flights, increased $357 million, or 23.5 percent, to $1.9 billion as a result of increased capacity and load factors. Regional Affiliates\\x92 traffic increased 32.0 percent to 7.3 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs), while capacity increased 26.0 percent to 10.8 billion ASMs, resulting in a 3.0 point increase in passenger load factor to 67.2 percent. Cargo revenues increased 12.0 percent, or $67 million, primarily due to a 10.2 percent increase in cargo ton miles. 35 Table of Contents Operating Expenses 2005 Compared to 2004 The Company\\x92s total operating expenses increased 10.7 percent, or $2.0 billion, to $20.8 billion in 2005 compared to 2004. American\\x92s mainline operating expenses per ASM in 2005 increased 7.9 percent compared to 2004 to 10.50 cents. This increase in operating expenses per ASM is due primarily to a 42.1 percent increase in American\\x92s price per gallon of fuel (net of the impact of a fuel tax credit and fuel hedging) in 2005 relative to 2004. Year ended (in millions) December 31, Change Percentage Operating Expenses 2005 from 2004 Change Wages, salaries and benefits $ 6,755 $ 36 0.5 % Aircraft fuel 5,615 1,646 41.5 (a ) Other rentals and landing fees 1,262 75 6.3 Depreciation and amortization 1,164 (128 ) (9.9 ) (b ) Commissions, booking fees and credit card expense 1,113 6 0.5 Maintenance, materials and repairs 989 18 1.9 Aircraft rentals 591 (18 ) (3.0 ) Food service 507 (51 ) (9.1 ) Other operating expenses 2,809 432 18.2 (c ) Total operating expenses $ 20,805 $ 2,016 10.7 % (a) Aircraft fuel expense increased primarily due to a 42.1 percent increase in American\\x92s price per gallon of fuel (including the benefit of a $55 million fuel excise tax refund received in March 2005 and the impact of fuel hedging) offset by a 2.2 percent decrease in American\\x92s fuel consumption. (b) Effective January 1, 2005, in order to more accurately reflect the expected useful lives of its aircraft, the Company changed its estimate of the depreciable lives of its Boeing 737-800, Boeing 757-200 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft from 25 to 30 years. As a result of this change, Depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by approximately $108 million during the year and the per share net loss was $0.65 less than it otherwise would have been. (c) Other operating expenses increased due to a $155 million charge for the retirement of 27 MD-80 aircraft, facilities charges of $56 million as part of the Company\\x92s restructuring initiatives and an $80 million charge for the termination of an airport construction contract. These charges were somewhat offset by a $37 million gain related to the resolution of a debt restructuring and a $22 million credit for the reversal of an insurance reserve. The account was also impacted by an increase in communications charges of $53 million year-over-year due to increased international flying and higher rates. 36 Table of Contents 2004 Compared to 2003 The Company\\x92s total operating expenses increased 2.8 percent, or $505 million, to $18.8 billion in 2004 compared to 2003. American\\x92s mainline operating expenses per ASM in 2004 decreased 4.1 percent compared to 2003 to 9.73 cents. This decrease in operating expenses per ASM is due primarily to American\\x92s cost savings initiatives and occurred despite the benefit in 2003 of the receipt of a grant from the U.S. government and a 38.5 percent increase in American\\x92s price per gallon of fuel (net of the impact of fuel hedging) in 2004 relative to 2003.

This decrease was offset to some degree by increased headcount related to capacity increases. (b) Aircraft fuel expense increased due to a 38.7 percent increase in the Company\\x92s price per gallon of fuel (net of the impact of fuel hedging) and a 3.3 percent increase in the Company\\x92s fuel consumption. (c) Maintenance, materials and repairs increased primarily due to increased aircraft utilization, the benefit from retiring aircraft subsiding and increases in contractual rates in certain flight hour agreements for outsourced aircraft engine maintenance. (d) Aircraft rentals decreased primarily due to the removal of leased aircraft from the fleet in the second half of 2003 as part of the Company\\x92s restructuring initiatives and concessionary agreements with certain lessors, which reduced future lease payment amounts and resulted in the conversion of 30 operating leases to capital leases in the second quarter of 2003. (e) Included in this amount are restructuring charges for 2004 which included (i) the reversal of reserves previously established for aircraft return costs of $20 million, facility exit costs of $21 million and employee severance of $11 million, (ii) $21 million in aircraft charges and (iii) $42 million in employee charges. Restructuring charges for 2003 included approximately (i) $341 million in aircraft charges offset by a $20 million credit to adjust prior accruals, (ii) $92 million in employee charges, (iii) $62 million in facility exit costs and a (iv) $68 million gain resulting from a transaction involving 33 of the Company\\x92s Fokker 100 aircraft and related debt. (f) U.S. government grant for 2003 reflects the reimbursement of security service fees from the U.S. government under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) consists of interest income and expense, interest capitalized and miscellaneous \\x97 net. 2005 Compared to 2004 Increases in both short-term investment balances and interest rates caused an increase in Interest income of $83 million, or 125.8 percent, to $149 million. Interest expense increased $86 million, or 9.9 percent, to $957 million primarily as a result of increases in interest rates. Miscellaneous-net for 2004 includes a $146 million gain on the sale of the Company\\x92s remaining interest in Orbitz. 2004 Compared to 2003 Interest income increased $11 million, or 20.0 percent, to $66 million due primarily to increases in short-term investment balances and interest rates. Interest expense increased $168 million, or 23.9 percent, to $871 million resulting primarily from the increase in the Company\\x92s long-term debt coupled with increases in interest rates, and an $84 million reduction in interest expense in 2003 related to the agreement reached with the IRS discussed below. Income Tax Benefit 2005 and 2004 The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with its 2005 and 2004 losses due to the Company providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 2003 The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with its 2003 losses due to the Company providing a valuation allowance. Additionally, in 2003, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995. As a result of this agreement, the Company recorded an $80 million tax benefit to reduce previously accrued income tax liabilities and an $84 million reduction in interest expense to reduce previously accrued interest related to the accrued income tax liabilities. 38 Table of Contents Operating Statistics The following table provides statistical information for American and Regional Affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Outlook The Company currently expects first quarter mainline unit costs to be approximately 10.7 cents. Capacity for American\\x92s mainline jet operations is expected to be essentially flat in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2005. American\\x92s mainline capacity for the full year 2006 is expected to decrease by 1.3 percent, with a decrease in domestic capacity of 4.1 percent and an increase in international capacity of 4.0 percent. Other Information Environmental Matters Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potential liability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites and certain airport locations. At sites where remedial litigation has commenced, potential liability is joint and several. AMR\\x92s alleged volumetric contributions at these sites are minimal compared to others. AMR does not expect these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additional information is included in Item 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Company\\x92s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used by management in the preparation of the Company\\x92s financial statements: accounting for long-lived assets, passenger revenue, frequent flyer program, pensions and other postretirement benefits, income taxes and tax contingencies. 39 Table of Contents Long-lived assets \\x96 The Company has approximately $19 billion of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2005, including approximately $18 billion related to flight equipment and other fixed assets. In addition to the original cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the Company, including estimated useful lives and salvage values. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, \\x93Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\\x94 (SFAS 144), the Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In making these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets; and (ii) estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service and estimated salvage values. A change in the Company\\x92s fleet plan has been the primary indicator that has resulted in an impairment charge in the past. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company permanently grounded and retired 27 McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airframes, 24 of which had previously been in temporary storage. See further discussion of the charge related to the retirement in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Passenger revenue \\x96 Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of Air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors, including the industry\\x92s pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized, including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the Company\\x92s historical experience, and are recognized at the time of departure. The Company\\x92s estimation techniques have been applied consistently from year to year. However, due to changes in the Company\\x92s ticket refund policy and changes in the travel profile of customers, historical trends may not be representative of future results. Frequent flyer program \\x96 American uses the incremental cost method to account for the portion of its frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American or American Eagle. American\\x92s frequent flyer liability is accrued each time a member accumulates sufficient mileage in his or her account to claim the lowest level of free travel award (25,000 miles) and the award is expected to be used for free travel. American includes fuel, food, and reservations/ticketing costs in the calculation of incremental cost. These estimates are generally updated based upon the Company\\x92s 12-month historical average of such costs. American also accrues a frequent flyer liability for the mileage credits that are expected to be used for travel on participating airlines based on historical usage patterns and contractual rates. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, American estimated that approximately ten million free travel awards were expected to be redeemed for free travel on American and American Eagle. In making the estimate of free travel awards, American has excluded mileage in inactive accounts, mileage related to accounts that have not yet reached the lowest level of free travel award, and mileage in active accounts that have reached the lowest level of free travel award but which are not expected to ever be redeemed for free travel on American or participating airlines. The Company\\x92s total liability for future AAdvantage award redemptions for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle or participating airlines as well as unrecognized revenue from selling AAdvantage miles to other companies was approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion (and is recorded as a component of Air traffic liability in the consolidated balance sheets), representing 17.7 percent and 19.6 percent of AMR\\x92s total current liabilities, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Revenue earned from selling AAdvantage miles to other companies is recognized in two components. The first component represents the revenue for air transportation sold and is valued at fair value. This revenue is deferred and recognized over the period the mileage is expected to be used, which is currently estimated to be 28 months. The second revenue component, representing the marketing products sold and administrative costs associated with operating the AAdvantage program, is recognized in the month of sale. The number of free travel awards used for travel on American and American Eagle was 2.6 million in 2005 and 2004, representing approximately 7.2 percent and 7.5 percent of passengers boarded, respectively. The Company believes displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given the Company\\x92s load factors, its ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory, and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total passengers boarded. Changes to the percentage of the amount of revenue deferred, deferred recognition period, percentage of awards expected to be redeemed for travel on participating airlines, cost per mile estimates or the minimum award level accrued could have a significant impact on the Company\\x92s revenues or incremental cost accrual in the year of the change as well as in future years. Pensions and other postretirement benefits \\x96 The Company\\x92s pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. The Company uses certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i) discount rate; (ii) expected return on plan assets; and (iii) expected health care cost trend rate. These assumptions as of December 31 were: 2005 2004 Discount rate 5.75 % 6.00 % Expected return on plan assets 8.75 % 9.00 % Expected health care cost trend rate: Pre-65 individuals Initial 4.5 % 4.5 % Ultimate 4.5 % 4.5 % Post-65 individuals Initial 9.0 % 10.0 % Ultimate (2010) 4.5 % 4.5 % The Company\\x92s discount rate is determined based upon the review of year-end high quality corporate bond rates. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2005 would increase the Company\\x92s pension and postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $662 million and $170 million, respectively, and increase estimated 2006 pension and postretirement benefits expense by $75 million and $9 million, respectively. The expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of the Company\\x92s historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions and the Company\\x92s target asset allocation of 40 percent longer duration corporate bonds, 25 percent U.S. value stocks, 20 percent developed international stocks, five percent emerging markets stocks and bonds and ten percent alternative (private) investments. The expected return on plan assets component of the Company\\x92s net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and the Company\\x92s target asset allocation. The Company monitors its actual asset allocation and believes that its long-term asset allocation will continue to approximate its target allocation. The Company\\x92s historical annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets, calculated using a geometric compounding of monthly returns, is approximately 10.6 percent as of December 31, 2005. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2005 would increase estimated 2006 pension expense by approximately $38 million. 41 Table of Contents The health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of the Company\\x92s historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points would increase estimated 2006 postretirement benefits expense by $40 million. The Company has pension and postretirement benefit unrecognized net actuarial losses as of December 31, 2005, of approximately $2.2 billion and $300 million, respectively. The unrecognized net actuarial losses represent changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation, the postretirement accumulated benefit obligation and plan assets resulting from (i) changes in assumptions and (ii) actual experience differing from assumptions. The amortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss component of the Company\\x92s 2006 pension and postretirement benefit net periodic benefit costs are expected to be approximately $81 million and $1 million, respectively. The Company\\x92s total 2006 pension expense and postretirement expense is currently estimated to be approximately $467 million and $248 million, respectively. The Company records an additional minimum pension liability when its accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the pension plans\\x92 assets in excess of amounts previously accrued for pension costs. As of December 31, 2005, the Company\\x92s additional minimum pension liability was $1.4 billion, up from $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of a decrease in the discount rate. The increase in the Company\\x92s minimum pension liability resulted in a 2005 debit to equity of approximately $379 million. An additional minimum pension liability is recorded as an increase to the pension liability, an increase to other assets (to the extent that a plan has unrecognized prior service costs) and a charge to stockholders\\x92 equity (deficit) as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company\\x92s pension and other postretirement benefits. Income taxes \\x96 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, \\x93Accounting for Income Taxes\\x94. Accordingly, the Company records a deferred tax asset valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers its historical earnings, trends, and outlook for future years in making this determination. The Company had a deferred tax valuation allowance of $1.3 billion and $833 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Tax contingencies \\x96 The Company has reserves for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it nevertheless has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by the Company resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the Company\\x92s potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue. In 2003, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995 and as a result, recorded an $80 million tax benefit to reduce previously accrued income tax liabilities and an $84 million reduction in interest expense to reduce previously accrued interest related to accrued tax liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), \\x93Share-Based Payment\\x94 (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. Prior to SFAS 123(R), companies could elect to account for share-based payments under APB 25 and provide the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123 (described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). SFAS 123(R) is effective January 1, 2006 for AMR. Under SFAS 123(R), compensation expense will be recognized for the portion of outstanding awards as service is provided, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS 123 for pro forma disclosures. The Company expects that the impact of adoption on its first quarter 2006 results will be similar to the amounts disclosed in each quarterly period during 2005. However, subsequent to the first quarter of 2006, the impact of SFAS 123(R) will decrease significantly due to the vesting period ending for stock options issued under the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7(A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions The risk inherent in the Company\\x92s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the Company\\x92s exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information. Aircraft Fuel The Company\\x92s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. In order to provide a measure of control over price and supply, the Company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight operations. The Company also manages the price risk of fuel costs primarily by using jet fuel, heating oil, and crude oil hedging contracts. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the December 31, 2005 and 2004 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected 2006 fuel usage, such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $528 million in 2006, inclusive of the impact of effective fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2005, and assumes the Company\\x92s fuel hedging program remains effective under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, \\x93Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\\x94. Comparatively, based on projected 2005 fuel usage, such an increase would have resulted in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $377 million in 2005, inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2004. The change in market risk is due to the increase in fuel prices. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had hedged, with option contracts, including collars, approximately 17 percent of its estimated 2006 fuel requirements and an insignificant amount of its estimated fuel requirements thereafter. The consumption hedged for 2006 is capped at an average price of approximately $60 per barrel of crude oil. Comparatively, as of December 31, 2004 the Company had hedged, with option contracts, approximately five percent of its estimated 2005 fuel requirements. A deterioration of the Company\\x92s financial position could negatively affect the Company\\x92s ability to hedge fuel in the future. Foreign Currency The Company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. The Company\\x92s largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and various Latin American currencies. The Company does not currently have a foreign currency hedge program related to its foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. The result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2005 and 2004 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $105 million and $93 million for the years ending December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, due to the Company\\x92s foreign-denominated revenues exceeding its foreign-denominated expenses. This sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2006 and 2005 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest The Company\\x92s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash and short-term investments, and its interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments. The Company\\x92s largest exposure with respect to variable-rate debt comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company had variable-rate debt instruments representing approximately 32 percent and 34 percent of its total long-term debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. If the Company\\x92s interest rates average 10 percent more in 2006 than they did at December 31, 2005, the Company\\x92s interest expense would increase by approximately $28 million and interest income from cash and short-term investments would increase by approximately $18 million. In comparison, at December 31, 2004, the Company estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in 2005 than they did at December 31, 2004, the Company\\x92s interest expense would have increased by approximately $21 million and interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased by approximately $7 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the Company\\x92s variable-rate long-term debt and cash and short-term investment balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004. 43 Table of Contents Market risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates, and amounts to approximately $409 million and $418 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair values of the Company\\x92s long-term debt were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the Company\\x92s incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Other The Company holds investments in certain other entities which are subject to market risk. However, the impact of such market risk on earnings is not significant due to the immateriality of the carrying value and the geographically diverse nature of these holdings. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\x92s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AMR Corporation at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Summary of Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2005 and for the three years ended December 31, 2005 include the accounts of AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including (i) its principal subsidiary American Airlines, Inc. (American) and (ii) its regional airline subsidiary, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation and its primary subsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines, Inc., Executive Airlines, Inc. and AMR Leasing Corporation (collectively, AMR Eagle). The consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Reclassifications Certain charges of $11 million and $407 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, resulting from the Terrorist Attacks and our related restructuring activities were previously recorded in Special charges in the consolidated statement of operations. These amounts have been included in Other operating expenses. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments The Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support projected workers\\x92 compensation obligations. Inventories Spare parts, materials and supplies relating to flight equipment are carried at average acquisition cost and are expensed when used in operations. Allowances for obsolescence are provided \\x97 over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines \\x97 for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date aircraft are retired from service. Allowances are also provided for spare parts currently identified as excess and obsolete. These allowances are based on management estimates, which are subject to change. Maintenance and Repair Costs Maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred, except costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms when an obligation exists. Intangible Assets Route acquisition costs and airport operating and gate lease rights represent the purchase price attributable to route authorities (including international airport take-off and landing slots), domestic airport take-off and landing slots and airport gate leasehold rights acquired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets (route acquisition costs) are tested for impairment annually on December 31, rather than amortized, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, \\x93Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\x94 (SFAS 142). Airport operating and gate lease rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years to a zero residual value. Statements of Cash Flows Short-term investments, without regard to remaining maturity at acquisition, are not considered as cash equivalents for purposes of the statements of cash flows. Measurement of Asset Impairments In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, \\x93Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\\x94 (SFAS 144), the Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In making these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets; and (ii) estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service the asset will be used in the Company\\x92s operations and estimated salvage values. 52 Table of Contents 1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued) Equipment and Property The provision for depreciation of operating equipment and property is computed on the straight-line method applied to each unit of property, except that major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are depreciated on a group basis. The depreciable lives used for the principal depreciable asset classifications are: Depreciable Life American jet aircraft and engines 20 \\x97 30 years Other regional aircraft and engines 16 \\x97 20 years Major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies Life of equipment to which applicable Improvements to leased flight equipment Term of lease Buildings and improvements (principally on leased land) 5 \\x97 30 years or term of lease, including estimated renewal options when renewal is economically compelled at key airports Furniture, fixtures and other equipment 3 \\x97 10 years Capitalized software 3 \\x97 10 years Effective January 1, 2005, in order to more accurately reflect the expected useful life of its aircraft, the Company changed its estimate of the depreciable lives of its Boeing 737-800, Boeing 757-200 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft from 25 to 30 years. As a result of this change, Depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by approximately $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Additionally, the per share net loss for the year was $0.65 less than it otherwise would have been. Residual values for aircraft, engines, major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are generally five to ten percent, except when guaranteed by a third party for a different amount. Equipment and property under capital leases are amortized over the term of the leases or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their expected useful lives. Lease terms vary but are generally ten to 25 years for aircraft and seven to 40 years for other leased equipment and property. Regional Affiliates Revenue from ticket sales is generally recognized when service is provided. Regional Affiliates revenues for flights connecting to American flights are allocated based on industry standard proration agreements. Passenger Revenue Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of Air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors, including the complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized, including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the Company\\x92s historical experience, and are recorded at the time of departure. 53 Table of Contents 1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued) Frequent Flyer Program The estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is accrued when such award levels are reached. American also accrues a frequent flyer liability for the mileage credits that are expected to be used for travel on participating airlines based on historical usage patterns and contractual rates. American sells mileage credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent flyer program. The portion of the revenue related to the sale of mileage credits, representing the revenue for air transportation sold, is valued at current market rates and is deferred and amortized over 28 months, which approximates the expected period over which the mileage credits are used. The remaining portion of the revenue, representing the marketing products sold and administrative costs associated with operating the AAdvantage program, is recognized upon sale as a component of passenger revenues, as the related services have been provided. The Company\\x92s total liability for future AAdvantage award redemptions for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle or participating airlines as well as unrecognized revenue from selling AAdvantage miles was approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion (and is recorded as a component of Air traffic liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets) at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Tax Contingencies The Company has reserves for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it nevertheless has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by the Company resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the Company\\x92s potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue. Advertising Costs The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was $144 million, $146 million and $150 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Stock Options The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, \\x93Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\\x94 (APB 25) and related Interpretations. Under APB 25, no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants if the exercise price of the Company\\x92s stock option grants is at or above the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company has adopted the pro forma disclosure features of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, \\x93Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation\\x94 (SFAS 123), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, \\x93Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure\\x94. As required by SFAS 123, pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share have been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and awards granted using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123. The fair value for the stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2005, 2004 and 2003: risk-free interest rates ranging from 2.93% to 3.97%; dividend yields of 0%; expected stock volatility of 55%; and expected life of the options ranging from 3.6 years to 4.0 years. 54 Table of Contents 1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued) The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share amounts if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation (in millions, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net Loss, as reported $ (861 ) $ (761 ) $ (1,228 ) Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss 132 21 20 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based methods for all awards (174 ) (85 ) (79 ) Pro forma net loss $ (903 ) $ (825 ) $ (1,287 ) Basic and diluted loss per share: As reported $ (5.21 ) $ (4.74 ) $ (7.76 ) Pro forma $ (5.46 ) $ (5.14 ) $ (8.13 ) New Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), \\x93Share-Based Payment\\x94 (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. SFAS 123(R) is effective January 1, 2006 for AMR. Under SFAS 123(R), the Company will recognize compensation expense for the portion of outstanding awards as service is provided, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS 123 for pro forma disclosures. In addition, the Company will discontinue recognizing compensation expense over the full vesting period for retirement eligible employees for future stock option grants and will instead recognize the expense immediately. The Company expects that the impact of adoption on its first quarter 2006 results will be similar to the amounts disclosed in each quarterly period during 2005. However, subsequent to the first quarter of 2006, the impact of SFAS 123(R) will decrease significantly due to the vesting period ending for stock options issued under the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan. 55 Table of Contents 2. Restructuring Charges and U.S. Government Grant In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company permanently grounded and retired 27 McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airframes, 24 of which had previously been in temporary storage. The other three aircraft were in-service immediately prior to being retired. Of these 27 aircraft, 13 are owned by the Company, six are accounted for as capital leases and eight are accounted for as operating leases. As a result of the retirement, the Company incurred a charge of $155 million, included in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, to accrue future lease commitments and write-down the aircraft frames to their fair values. In determining the fair values of these aircraft, the Company considered outside third party appraisals and recent transactions involving inventory for the aircraft. In 2003, the Company reached concessionary agreements with certain lessors. Certain of these agreements provided that the Company\\x92s obligations under the related debt would revert to the original terms if certain events occurred prior to December 31, 2005. Because none of these events occurred prior to that date, the Company recognized a gain of $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 that was related to the resolution of a debt restructuring agreed to as part of the concessions. As a result of the Terrorist Attacks, the depressed revenue environment, high fuel prices and the Company\\x92s restructuring activities, the Company recorded a number of charges. The following table summarizes the components of these charges and the remaining accruals for future lease payments, aircraft lease return and other costs, facilities closure costs and employee severance and benefit costs (in millions): Aircraft Facility Employee Charges Exit Costs Charges Other Total Remaining accrual at January 1, 2003 $ 209 $ 17 $ 44 $ \\x97 $ 270 Restructuring charges 341 62 92 (68 ) 427 Adjustments (20 ) \\x97 \\x97 \\x97 (20 ) Non-cash charges (264 ) (17 ) 23 68 (190 ) Payments (69 ) (6 ) (133 ) \\x97 (208 ) Remaining accrual at December 31, 2003 197 56 26 \\x97 279 Restructuring charges 21 \\x97 42 \\x97 63 Adjustments (20 ) (21 ) (11 ) \\x97 (52 ) Non-cash charges (21 ) \\x97 \\x97 \\x97 (21 ) Payments (48 ) (9 ) (21 ) \\x97 (78 ) Remaining accrual at December 31, 2004 129 26 36 \\x97 191 Restructuring charges 155 19 \\x97 (37 ) 137 Adjustments \\x97 (2 ) \\x97 \\x97 (2 ) Non-cash charges (119 ) \\x97 \\x97 37 (82 ) Payments (13 ) (7 ) (36 ) \\x97 (56 ) Remaining accrual at December 31, 2005 $ 152 $ 36 $ \\x97 $ \\x97 $ 188 Cash outlays related to the accruals for aircraft charges and facility exit costs will occur through 2017 and 2018, respectively. U.S. government grant In April 2003, the President signed the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (the Appropriations Act), which included provisions authorizing payment of $2.3 billion to reimburse air carriers for increased security costs in proportion to the amounts each carrier had paid or collected in passenger security and air carrier security fees to the Transportation Security Administration (the Security Fee Reimbursement). The Company\\x92s Security Fee Reimbursement was $358 million (net of payments to independent regional affiliates) and is included in U.S. government grant in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 56 Table of Contents 2. Restructuring Charges and U.S. Government Grant (Continued) Other On September 22, 2001, President Bush signed into law the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Stabilization Act). The Stabilization Act provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all claims, whether compensatory or punitive, arising from the Terrorist Attacks, against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability coverage maintained by the air carrier. Based upon estimates provided by the Company\\x92s insurance providers, the Company recorded a liability of approximately $2.3 billion for claims arising from the Terrorist Attacks, after considering the liability protections provided for by the Stabilization Act. The balance, recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet was $1.9 billion at both December 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company has also recorded a liability of approximately $423 million related to flight 587, which crashed on November 12, 2001. The Company has recorded a receivable for all of these amounts, which the Company expects to recover from its insurance carriers as claims are resolved. These insurance receivables and liabilities are classified as Other assets and Other liabilities and deferred credits, respectively, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and are based on reserves established by the Company\\x92s insurance carriers. These estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available concerning the expected claims. 3. Investments Short-term investments consisted of (in millions): December 31, 2005 2004 Overnight investments and time deposits $ 210 $ 222 Corporate and bank notes 3,340 2,214 U. S. government agency mortgages 74 115 U.

Unrealized gains and losses are reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 57 Table of Contents 3. Investments (Continued) In 2004, the Company sold its remaining interest in Orbitz, a travel planning website, resulting in total proceeds of $185 million and a gain of $146 million, which is included in Miscellaneous-net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. During 2003, the Company sold its interests in Worldspan, a computer reservations company, and Hotwire, a discount travel website. The Company received $180 million in cash and a $39 million promissory note for its interest in Worldspan. It received $84 million in cash, $80 million of which was recognized as a gain, for its interest in Hotwire. In addition, during 2003, the Company sold a portion of its interest in Orbitz in connection with an Orbitz initial public offering and a secondary offering, resulting in total proceeds of $65 million, and a gain of $70 million. Excluded from this gain are certain contingent payments that will be recorded when and if received. The gains on the sale of the Company\\x92s interests in Hotwire and Orbitz are included in Miscellaneous-net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 4. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees As of December 31, 2005, the Company had commitments to acquire two Boeing 777-200ERs in 2006 and an aggregate of 47 Boeing 737-800s and seven Boeing 777-200ERs in 2013 through 2016. Future payments for all aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate $102 million in 2006 and an aggregate of approximately $2.8 billion in 2011 through 2016. The Company has pre-arranged backstop financing available for the aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2006. American has granted Boeing a security interest in American\\x92s purchase deposits with Boeing. These purchase deposits totaled $277 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company has contracts related to facility construction or improvement projects, primarily at airport locations. The contractual obligations related to these projects totaled approximately $236 million as of December 31, 2005. The Company expects to make payments of $176 million and $60 million in 2006 and 2007, respectively. See Footnote 6 for information related to financing of JFK construction costs which are included in these amounts. In addition, the Company has an information technology support related contract that requires minimum annual payments of $152 million through 2013. American has capacity purchase agreements with two regional airlines, Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua) and Trans States Airlines, Inc. (collectively the American Connection® carriers) to provide Embraer EMB-140/145 regional jet services to certain markets under the brand \\x93American Connection\\x94. Under these arrangements, the Company pays the American Connection carriers a fee per block hour to operate the aircraft. The block hour fees are designed to cover the American Connection carriers\\x92 fully allocated costs plus a margin. Assumptions for certain costs such as fuel, landing fees, insurance, and aircraft ownership are trued up to actual values on a pass through basis. In consideration for these payments, the Company retains all passenger and other revenues resulting from the operation of the American Connection regional jets. Minimum payments under the contracts are $90 million in 2006, $64 million in 2007, $65 million in 2008 and $18 million in 2009. In addition, if the Company terminates the Chautauqua contract without cause, Chautauqua has the right to put its 15 Embraer aircraft to the Company. If this were to happen, the Company would take possession of the aircraft and become liable for lease obligations totaling approximately $21 million per year with lease expirations in 2018 and 2019. The Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks. The Company is not able to estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in the following paragraphs. 58 Table of Contents 4. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (Continued) The Company\\x92s loan agreements and other London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate the Company to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with, or credit extended by such lender related to the loan, (ii) any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy requirements. In addition, the Company\\x92s loan agreements, derivative contracts and other financing arrangements typically contain a withholding tax provision that requires the Company to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law. These increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts the Company could be obligated to pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of default, and, in a secured financing transaction, would entitle the lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due. In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans and derivative transactions, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have rights to terminate the transaction based on changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, the Company may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant transaction. In its aircraft financing agreements, the Company generally indemnifies the financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf and other relevant parties against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities (or taxes) relate to the negligence of the indemnified parties. The Company has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real estate leases where the Company as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities related to the Company\\x92s use of the leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, the Company provides environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to the Company\\x92s use of the leased property. Under certain contracts with third parties, the Company indemnifies the third party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third party, or certain other parties. The terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. Generally, the Company has liability insurance protecting the Company for its obligations it has undertaken under these indemnities. AMR and American have event risk covenants in approximately $1.8 billion of indebtedness and operating leases as of December 31, 2005. These covenants permit the holders of such obligations to receive a higher rate of return (between 100 and 650 basis points above the stated rate) if a designated event, as defined, should occur and the credit ratings of such obligations are downgraded below certain levels within a certain period of time. No designated event, as defined, has occurred as of December 31, 2005. The Company is subject to environmental issues at various airport and non-airport locations for which it has accrued $40 million and $62 million, which are included in Accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Management believes, after considering a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition of these environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the Company\\x92s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on the Company\\x92s current assessments of the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or decrease as these assessments change. The Company is involved in certain claims and litigation related to its operations. In the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from these claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\\x92s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, after consideration of available insurance. 59 Table of Contents 5. Leases AMR\\x92s subsidiaries lease various types of equipment and property, primarily aircraft and airport facilities. The future minimum lease payments required under capital leases, together with the present value of such payments, and future minimum lease payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2005, were (in millions): Capital Operating Year Ending December 31, Leases Leases 2006 $ 263 $ 1,065 2007 196 1,039 2008 236 973 2009 175 872 2010 140 815 2011 and thereafter 794 7,453 1,804 $ 12,217 (1) Less amount representing interest 716 Present value of net minimum lease payments $ 1,088 (1) As of December 31, 2005, included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is approximately $1.4 billion relating to rent expense being recorded in advance of future operating lease payments. At December 31, 2005, the Company was operating 213 jet aircraft and 27 turboprop aircraft under operating leases and 91 jet aircraft and three turboprop aircraft under capital leases. The aircraft leases can generally be renewed at rates based on fair market value at the end of the lease term for one to five years. Some aircraft leases have purchase options at or near the end of the lease term at fair market value, but generally not to exceed a stated percentage of the defined lessor\\x92s cost of the aircraft or a predetermined fixed amount. Certain special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to improve airport facilities and purchase equipment. To the extent these transactions were committed to prior to May 21, 1998 (the effective date of EITF 97-10, \\x93The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction\\x94) they are accounted for as operating leases under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 23, \\x93Leases of Certain Property Owned by a Governmental Unit or Authority\\x94. Approximately $1.9 billion of these bonds (with total future payments of approximately $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2005) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both. Approximately $523 million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to repurchase the bonds at various times: $28 million in 2006, $100 million in 2007, $218 million in 2008, $112 million in 2014 and $65 million in 2015. Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce existing rent leveling accruals or be considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments. The special facility revenue bonds that contain mandatory tender provisions are listed in the table above at their ultimate maturity date rather than their mandatory tender provision date. Approximately $198 million of special facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions were successfully remarketed in 2005. They were acquired by American in 2003 under a mandatory tender provision. Thus, the receipt by American of the proceeds from the remarketing resulted in an increase to Other liabilities and deferred credits where the tendered bonds had been classified pending their use to offset certain future operating lease obligations. 60 Table of Contents 5. Leases (Continued) Rent expense, excluding landing fees, was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. American has determined that it holds a significant variable interest in, but is not the primary beneficiary of, certain trusts that are the lessors under 84 of its aircraft operating leases. These leases contain a fixed price purchase option, which allows American to purchase the aircraft at a predetermined price on a specified date. However, American does not guarantee the residual value of the aircraft. As of December 31, 2005, future lease payments required under these leases totaled $2.6 billion. 6. Indebtedness Long-term debt consisted of (in millions): December 31, 2005 2004 Secured variable and fixed rate indebtedness due through 2021 (effective rates from 4.33% - 10.68% at December 31, 2005) $ 6,473 $ 6,340 Enhanced equipment trust certificates due through 2012 (rates from 3.86% - 12.00% at December 31, 2005) 3,424 3,707 6.125% - 8.5% special facility revenue bonds due through 2036 1,697 946 Credit facility agreement due through 2010 (effective rate of 8.73% at December 31, 2005) 788 850 4.25% - 4.50% senior convertible notes due 2023 \\x96 2024 619 619 9.0% - 10.20% debentures due through 2021 320 330 7.88% - 10.55% notes due through 2039 286 303 13,607 13,095 Less current maturities 1,077 659 Long-term debt, less current maturities $ 12,530 $ 12,436 Maturities of long-term debt (including sinking fund requirements) for the next five years are: 2006 \\x97 $1.1 billion; 2007 \\x97 $1.2 billion; 2008 \\x97 $665 million; 2009 \\x97 $1.7 billion; 2010 \\x97 $1.1 billion. In September 2005, American sold and leased back 89 spare engines with a book value of $105 million to a variable interest entity (VIE). The net proceeds received from third parties were $133 million. American is considered the primary beneficiary of the activities of the VIE as American has substantially all of the residual value risk associated with the transaction. As such, American is required to consolidate the VIE in its financial statements. At December 31, 2005, the book value of the engines was $103 million and was included in Flight equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. The engines serve as collateral for the VIE\\x92s long-term debt of $133 million at December 31, 2005, which has also been included in the consolidated balance sheet. The VIE has no other significant operations. 61 Table of Contents 6. Indebtedness (Continued) Also in September 2005, American purchased certain debt obligations due October 2006 with a face value of $261 million at par value from an institutional investor. In conjunction with the purchase, American borrowed an additional $245 million under an existing mortgage agreement with a final maturity in December 2012 from the same investor. The interest rate on the mortgage agreement remains substantially unchanged. The additional borrowings required American to grant a security interest in certain spare engines and related collateral. The transaction was accounted for as a modification of the original debt under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 96-19 \\x93Debtor\\x92s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments\\x94. As a result of this transaction, the Company\\x92s 2006 maturities of long-term debt decreased from $1.3 billion to $1.1 billion. In November 2005, the New York City Industrial Development Agency issued facilities sublease revenue bonds for John F. Kennedy International Airport to provide reimbursement to American for certain facility construction and other related costs. The Company has recorded the issuance of $775 million (net of $25 million discount) as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. The bonds bear interest at fixed rates, with an average effective rate of 8.06 percent, and mature over various periods of time, with a final maturity in 2031. Proceeds from the offering are to be used to reimburse past and future costs associated with the Company\\x92s terminal construction project at JFK. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had received approximately $491 million of the proceeds as reimbursements of certain facility construction and other related costs. The remaining $284 million of bond issuance proceeds are classified as Other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, of which $207 million are held by the trustee for reimbursement of construction costs and will be available to the Company in the future, and $77 million are held in a debt service reserve fund. During the year ended December 31, 2005, AMR Eagle borrowed approximately $319 million, net of discount, under various debt agreements related to the purchase of regional jet aircraft. These debt agreements are secured by the related aircraft, have effective interest rates ranging from 5.00 percent to 5.13 percent, are guaranteed by AMR and mature over various periods of time through 2021. American has a credit facility consisting of a $540 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $248 million term loan facility (the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility, respectively, and collectively, the Credit Facility). Advances under either facility can be designated, at American\\x92s election, as LIBOR rate advances or base rate advances. Interest accrues at the LIBOR rate or base rate, as applicable, plus, in either case, the applicable margin. The applicable margin with respect to the Revolving Facility can range from 3.25 percent to 5.25 percent per annum, in the case of LIBOR advances, and from 2.25 percent to 4.25 percent per annum, in the case of base rate advances, depending upon the senior secured debt rating of the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2005, the Credit Facility was fully drawn and had an interest rate of 8.73 percent. The interest rate is reset at least every six months based on the current LIBOR rate election. The Revolving Facility matures on June 17, 2009. Commitments under the Revolving Facility are reduced on a quarterly basis with $15 million (or 2.5 percent) of the commitments being reduced in each of the first twelve quarters of the life of the Revolving Facility and the remainder due at maturity. Principal amounts repaid under the Revolving Facility may be re-borrowed, up to the then-available aggregate amount of the commitments. 62 Table of Contents 6. Indebtedness (Continued) The Term Loan Facility matures on December 17, 2010. The Term Loan Facility amortizes on a quarterly basis over a period of six years, with less than $1 million (or 0.25 percent) of the principal payable quarterly in each of the first 20 quarters and the remainder due at maturity. Principal amounts repaid under the Term Loan Facility may not be re-borrowed. The Credit Facility is secured by certain aircraft. The Credit Facility includes a covenant that requires periodic appraisal of the aircraft at current market value and requires American to pledge more aircraft or cash collateral if the loan amount is more than 50 percent of the appraised value (after giving effect to sublimits for specified categories of aircraft). In addition, the Credit Facility is secured by all of American\\x92s existing route authorities between the United States and Tokyo, Japan, together with certain slots, gates and facilities that support the operation of such routes. American\\x92s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by AMR, and AMR\\x92s guaranty is secured by a pledge of all the outstanding shares of common stock of American. The Credit Facility contains a covenant (the Liquidity Covenant) requiring American to maintain, as defined, unrestricted cash, unencumbered short term investments and amounts available for drawing under committed revolving credit facilities of not less than $1.25 billion for each quarterly period through the remaining life of the Credit Facility. American was in compliance with the Liquidity Covenant as of December 31, 2005 and expects to be able to continue to comply with this covenant. In addition, the Credit Facility contains a covenant (the EBITDAR Covenant) requiring AMR to maintain a ratio of cash flow (defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense (less capitalized interest), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals, adjusted for certain gains or losses and non-cash items) to fixed charges (comprising interest expense (less capitalized interest) and rentals) of at least the amount specified below for each period of four consecutive quarters ending on the dates set forth below: Four Quarter Period Ending Cash Flow Coverage Ratio December 31, 2005 1.10:1.00 March 31, 2006 1.20:1.00 June 30, 2006 1.25:1.00 September 30, 2006 1.30:1.00 December 31, 2006 1.30:1.00 March 31, 2007 1.35:1.00 June 30, 2007 1.40:1.00 September 30, 2007 1.40:1.00 December 31, 2007 1.40:1.00 March 31, 2008 (and each fiscal quarter thereafter) 1.50:1.00 AMR was in compliance with the EBITDAR Covenant at December 31, 2005 and expects to be able to comply with this covenant for the period ending March 31, 2006. However, given the historically high price of fuel and the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, it is difficult to assess whether AMR and American will, in fact, be able to continue to comply with the Liquidity Covenant and, in particular, the EBITDAR Covenant, and there are no assurances that AMR and American will be able to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the Credit Facility which \\x97 - if the Company did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default \\x97 - could result in a default under a significant amount of the Company\\x92s other debt and lease obligations and otherwise adversely affect the Company. In 2004, American issued $180 million of Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2009, which bear interest at 7.25 percent. As of December 31, 2005, these notes were secured by certain spare parts and cash collateral. 63 Table of Contents 6. Indebtedness (Continued) In 2004, the Company issued $324 million principal amount of its 4.50 percent senior convertible notes due 2024 (the 4.50 Notes) and in 2003 the Company issued $300 million principal amount of its 4.25 percent senior convertible notes due 2023 (the 4.25 Notes). Each note is convertible into AMR common stock at a conversion rate of 45.3515 shares for the 4.50 Notes and 57.61 shares for the 4.25 Notes, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an equivalent conversion price of $22.05 per share for the 4.50 Notes and $17.36 per share for the 4.25 Notes), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The notes are convertible under certain circumstances, including if (i) the closing sale price of the Company\\x92s common stock reaches a certain level for a specified period of time, (ii) the trading price of the notes as a percentage of the closing sale price of the Company\\x92s common stock falls below a certain level for a specified period of time, (iii) the Company calls the notes for redemption, or (iv) certain corporate transactions occur. Holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the 4.50 Notes on February 15, 2009, 2014 and 2019 and 4.25 Notes on September 23, 2008, 2013 and 2018 at a purchase price equal to the principal amount of the notes being purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The Company may pay the purchase price in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. After February 15, 2009 and September 23, 2008, the Company may redeem all or any portion of the 4.50 Notes and 4.25 Notes, respectively, for cash at a price equal to the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. These notes are guaranteed by American. If the holders of the 4.50 Notes or the 4.25 Notes require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the notes on the repurchase dates, it is the Company\\x92s present intention to satisfy the requirement in cash. Certain debt is secured by aircraft, engines, equipment and other assets having a net book value of approximately $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, AMR has issued guarantees covering approximately $1.7 billion of American\\x92s tax-exempt bond debt and American has issued guarantees covering approximately $1.2 billion of AMR\\x92s unsecured debt. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, AMR and American have issued guarantees covering approximately $428 million of AMR Eagle\\x92s secured debt, and AMR has issued guarantees covering an additional $2.9 billion of AMR Eagle\\x92s secured debt. Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were $828 million, $729 million and $661 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 64 Table of Contents 7. Financial Instruments and Risk Management As part of the Company\\x92s risk management program, AMR uses a variety of financial instruments, primarily fuel option and collar contracts. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these financial instruments, but it does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet its obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date, reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. To manage credit risks, the Company selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. The Company also maintains industry-standard security agreements with a number of its counterparties which may require the Company or the counterparty to post collateral if the value of selected instruments exceed specified mark-to-market thresholds or upon certain changes in credit ratings. The Company\\x92s outstanding posted collateral as of December 31, 2005 is included in restricted cash and short-term investments and is not material. A deterioration of the Company\\x92s liquidity position may negatively affect the Company\\x92s ability to hedge fuel in the future. Fuel Price Risk Management American enters into jet fuel, heating oil and crude oil hedging contracts to dampen the impact of the volatility in jet fuel prices. These instruments generally have maturities of up to 24 months. The Company accounts for its fuel derivative contracts as cash flow hedges and records the fair value of its fuel hedging contracts in Other current assets and Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the ineffective portion of its fuel hedge contracts by comparing the cumulative change in the total value of the fuel hedge contract, or group of fuel hedge contracts, to the cumulative change in a hypothetical jet fuel hedge. If the total cumulative change in value of the fuel hedge contract more than offsets the total cumulative change in a hypothetical jet fuel hedge, the difference is considered ineffective and is immediately recognized as a component of Aircraft fuel expense. Effective gains or losses on fuel hedging contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are recognized in earnings as a component of Aircraft fuel expense when the underlying jet fuel being hedged is used. Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or other crude oil related commodities. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, \\x93Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\\x94, the Company assesses, both at the inception of each hedge and on an on-going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. In doing so, the Company uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g. WTI Crude oil and NYMEX Heating oil) to the change in the price of jet fuel over a 36 month period. The Company also monitors the actual dollar offset of the hedges\\x92 market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be \\x93highly effective\\x94 if the R-squared is greater than 80 percent and the dollar offset correlation is within 80 percent to 125 percent. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to discontinue the hedging relationship. As a result of its quarterly effectiveness assessment on September 30, 2005, the Company determined that all of its derivatives settling during the remainder of 2005 and certain of its derivatives settling in 2006 were no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in forecasted jet fuel purchases. As a result, effective on October 1, 2005, all subsequent changes in the fair value of those particular hedge contracts have been and will be recognized directly in earnings rather than being deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Hedge accounting will continue to be applied to derivatives used to hedge forecasted jet fuel purchases that are expected to remain highly effective. 65 Table of Contents 7. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized net gains of approximately $64 million, $99 million and $149 million, respectively, as a component of fuel expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to its fuel hedging agreements. The fair value of the Company\\x92s fuel hedging agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004, representing the amount the Company would receive to terminate the agreements, totaled $122 million and $51 million, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Management The Company has entered into Japanese yen currency exchange agreements to hedge certain yen-based capital lease obligations (effectively converting these obligations into dollar-based obligations). The Company accounts for its Japanese yen currency exchange agreements as cash flow hedges whereby the fair value of the related Japanese yen currency exchange agreements is reflected in Other liabilities and deferred credits and Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company has no ineffectiveness with regard to its Japanese yen currency exchange agreements. The fair values of the Company\\x92s yen currency exchange agreements, representing the amount the Company would pay to terminate the agreements, were $39 million and $23 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The exchange rates on the Japanese yen agreements range from 66.50 to 99.65 yen per U.S. dollar. The actual exchange rate was 117.75 and 102.63 yen per U.S. dollar at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Fair Values of Financial Instruments The fair values of the Company\\x92s long-term debt were estimated using quoted market prices where available. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair values were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company\\x92s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company\\x92s long-term debt, including current maturities, were (in millions): December 31, 2005 2004 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Value Value Value Value Secured variable and fixed rate indebtedness $ 6,473 $ 5,761 $ 6,340 $ 5,333 Enhanced equipment trust certificates 3,424 3,414 3,707 3,578 6.125% - 8.5% special facility revenue bonds 1,697 1,673 946 797 Credit facility agreement 788 791 850 852 4.25% - 4.50 % senior convertible notes 619 800 619 451 9.0% - 10.20% debentures 320 271 330 224 7.88% - 10.55% notes 286 206 303 197 $ 13,607 $ 12,916 $ 13,095 $ 11,432 66 Table of Contents 8. Income Taxes The significant components of the income tax benefit were (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Current $ \\x97 $ \\x97 $ (80 ) Deferred \\x97 \\x97 \\x97 $ \\x97 $ \\x97 $ (80 ) There was no net federal or state and other tax provision/(benefit) in 2005. The income tax provision/(benefit) includes a federal income tax provision/(benefit) of $(4) million and $(76) million and state and other income tax provision/(benefit) of $4 million and $(4) million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The income tax benefit differed from amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Statutory income tax benefit $ (301 ) $ (266 ) $ (458 ) State income tax expense/(benefit), net of federal tax effect (8 ) (14 ) (31 ) IRS audit settlement \\x97 \\x97 (80 ) Meal expense 9 9 11 Expiration of foreign tax credits \\x97 \\x97 9 Deferred tax assets not benefited 298 255 465 Other, net 2 16 4 Income tax benefit $ \\x97 $ \\x97 $ (80 ) The change in valuation allowance in 2005, 2004 and 2003 related primarily to net operating loss carryforwards and resolution of certain tax contingencies. The recording of other comprehensive income items, primarily the minimum pension liability, resulted in changes to the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance. The total increase in the valuation allowance was $506 million, $170 million and $293 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax assets, will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (including reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those temporary differences will become deductible. 67 Table of Contents 8. Income Taxes (Continued) The components of AMR\\x92s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions): December 31, 2005 2004 Deferred tax assets: Postretirement benefits other than pensions $ 1,113 $ 1,082 Rent expense 594 696 Alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 418 423 Operating loss carryforwards 2,504 2,065 Pensions 727 536 Frequent flyer obligation 304 267 Gains from lease transactions 158 197 Other 698 598 Total deferred tax assets 6,516 5,864 Valuation allowance (1,339 ) (833 ) Net deferred tax assets 5,177 5,031 Deferred tax liabilities: Accelerated depreciation and amortization (4,783 ) (4,620 ) Other (394 ) (411 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (5,177 ) (5,031 ) Net deferred tax liability $ \\x97 $ \\x97 At December 31, 2005, the Company had available for federal income tax purposes an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $418 million, which is available for an indefinite period, and federal net operating losses of approximately $6.6 billion for regular tax purposes, which will expire, if unused, beginning in 2022. The Company had available for state income tax purposes net operating losses of $4.2 billion, which expire, if unused, in years 2006 through 2024. The amount that will expire in 2006 is $162 million. Cash payments for income taxes were $7 million and $3 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash refunds for income taxes were $575 million in 2003. The amount received in 2003 relates primarily to net operating loss carryback claims, including a carryback claim filed as a result of a provision in Congress\\x92 economic stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs). This change allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather than two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover its NOLs. 9. Stock Awards and Options In March 2003, the Board of Directors of AMR approved the issuance of additional shares of AMR common stock to employees and certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers in connection with negotiations concerning concessions. The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance was approximately 46.9 million shares. From the foregoing authorization, the Company issued approximately 2.5 million shares to vendors from treasury stock in 2003, resulting in a re-allocation from Treasury stock to Additional paid-in capital of $142 million. Also in 2003, the Company established the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the 2003 Plan) to provide equity awards to employees (from the above shares authorized for issuance) in connection with the Labor Agreements and Management Reductions. Under the 2003 Plan, employees may be granted stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock. The total number of shares authorized for distribution under the 2003 Plan is 42,680,000 shares. 68 Table of Contents 9. Stock Awards and Options (Continued) Under the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, officers and key employees of AMR and its subsidiaries may be granted stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, deferred stock, stock purchase rights, other stock-based awards and/or performance-related awards, including cash bonuses. The total number of common shares authorized for distribution under the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan is 23,700,000 shares. The 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan, the successor to the 1988 Long Term Incentive Plan, will terminate no later than May 21, 2008. Options granted under the 1988 and 1998 Long Term Incentive Plans (collectively, the LTIP Plans) and the 2003 Plan are awarded with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on date of grant, become exercisable in equal annual installments over periods ranging from two to five years following the date of grant and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 8.6 million shares were available for future grant under the LTIP Plans and the 2003 Plan. In May 1997, in conjunction with a labor agreement reached between American and members of the Allied Pilots Association (APA), the Company established the Pilots Stock Option Plan (The Pilot Plan). The Pilot Plan granted members of the APA the option to purchase 11.5 million shares of AMR stock at $41.69 per share (after giving effect to the 1998 stock-split), $5 less than the average fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. These shares were exercisable immediately. In conjunction with the Sabre spin-off (March 2000), the exercise price was adjusted to $17.59 per share. Stock option activity under the LTIP Plans, the Pilot Plan and the 2003 Plan was: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Weighted Weighted Weighted Average Average Average Exercise Exercise Exercise Options Price Options Price Options Price Outstanding at January 1 67,885,713 $ 13.09 68,883,709 $ 13.08 30,842,767 $ 23.66 Granted 1,067,900 13.56 1,679,625 9.16 40,751,272 5.39 Exercised (8,426,823 ) 6.52 (1,173,541 ) 6.05 (112,432 ) 13.28 Canceled (1,473,761 ) 13.84 (1,504,080 ) 13.45 (2,597,898 ) 17.92 Outstanding at December 31 59,053,029 $ 14.01 67,885,713 $ 13.09 68,883,709 $ 13.08 Exercisable at December 31 42,214,488 $ 16.39 37,049,571 $ 17.13 22,912,273 $ 22.36 The following table summarizes information about the stock options outstanding at December 31, 2005: Weighted Weighted Weighted Range of Number of Average Average Number of Average Exercise Options Remaining Exercise Options Exercise Prices Outstanding Life (years) Price Exercisable Price $1-$5 27,935,476 7.30 $ 5.00 16,154,595 $ 5.00 $5-$20 14,646,486 3.50 15.46 10,754,360 17.09 $20-$30 10,230,644 4.30 24.72 9,386,940 24.55 Over $30 6,240,423 4.46 33.44 5,918,593 33.29 59,053,029 5.54 $ 14.01 42,214,488 $ 16.39 69 Table of Contents 9. Stock Awards and Options (Continued) The weighted-average grant date fair value per share (calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model) of all stock option awards granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $6.28, $4.23 and $2.32, respectively. Shares of deferred stock were awarded at no cost to officers and key employees under the LTIP Plans\\x92 Career Equity Program and will be issued upon the individual\\x92s retirement from AMR or, in certain circumstances, will vest on a pro rata basis.

The fair value of the performance shares granted is equal to the market price of the Company\\x92s stock at the date of grant. The shares vest over a three-year performance period based upon certain specified financial measures of the Company. Performance share activity was: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Outstanding at January 1 830,134 1,570,498 1,230,104 Granted \\x97 550 512,885 Issued (53,955 ) (153,549 ) \\x97 Awards settled in cash (561,313 ) (540,749 ) \\x97 Canceled (214,866 ) (46,616 ) (172,491 ) Outstanding at December 31 \\x97 830,134 1,570,498 The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of performance share awards granted during 2004 and 2003 was $16.36 and $10.50, respectively. No performance share awards were granted during 2005. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the total charge for stock-based compensation expense included in wages, salaries and benefits expense, primarily related to the Company\\x92s performance unit and share plans (of which there are three active plans at any given point in time), was $132 million, $21 million and $20 million, respectively. No compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants under the LTIP Plans or the 2003 Plan, since the exercise price was equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. 70 Table of Contents 10. Retirement Benefits All employees of the Company may participate in pension plans if they meet the plans\\x92 eligibility requirements. The defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its defined benefit plans. American\\x92s pilots also participate in a defined contribution plan for which Company contributions are determined as a percentage of participant compensation. Effective January 1, 2001, American established a defined contribution plan for non-contract employees in which the Company will match the employees\\x92 before-tax contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to 5.5 percent of their pensionable pay. During 2000, American provided a one-time election for current non-contract employees to remain in the defined benefit plan or discontinue accruing future credited service in the defined benefit plan as of January 1, 2001 and begin participation in the defined contribution plan. Effective January 1, 2002, all new non-contract employees of the Company become members of the defined contribution plan. In addition to pension benefits, other postretirement benefits, including certain health care and life insurance benefits (which provide secondary coverage to Medicare), are provided to retired employees. The amount of health care benefits is limited to lifetime maximums as outlined in the plan. Substantially all regular employees of American and employees of certain other subsidiaries may become eligible for these benefits if they satisfy eligibility requirements during their working lives. Certain employee groups make contributions toward funding a portion of their retiree health care benefits during their working lives. The Company funds benefits as incurred and makes contributions to match employee prefunding. 71 Table of Contents 10.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, pension benefit plan assets of $48 million and $116 million, respectively, and other benefits plan assets of approximately $159 million and $149 million, respectively, were invested in shares of mutual funds managed by a subsidiary of AMR. 72 Table of Contents 10.

Expected returns on longer duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other assets are based on a combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and expected value to be generated through active management, currency overlay and securities lending programs. The Company\\x92s annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets as of December 31, 2005, was approximately 10.6 percent. The Company\\x92s pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, by asset category, are as follows: 2005 2004 Long duration bonds 37 % 38 % U.S. stocks 31 31 International stocks 21 21 Emerging markets stocks and bonds 6 6 Alternative (private) investments 5 4 Total 100 % 100 % The Company\\x92s target asset allocation is 40 percent longer duration corporate and U.S. government/agency bonds, 25 percent U.S. value stocks, 20 percent developed international stocks, five percent emerging markets stocks and bonds, and ten percent alternative (private) investments. Each asset class is actively managed and the plans\\x92 assets have produced returns, net of management fees, in excess of the expected rate of return over the last ten years. Stocks and emerging market bonds are used to provide diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over the long-term than longer duration U.S. bonds. Public stocks are managed using a value investment approach in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. Longer duration U.S. bonds are used to partially hedge the assets from declines in interest rates. Alternative (private) investments are used to provide expected returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term. Additionally, the Company engages currency overlay managers in an attempt to increase returns by protecting non-U.S. dollar denominated assets from a rise in the relative value of the U.S. dollar. The Company also participates in securities lending programs in order to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis. 74 Table of Contents 10.

In addition to making contributions to its postretirement benefit plan, the Company funds the majority of the benefit payments under this plan. The Company\\x92s estimate of its defined benefit pension plan contributions reflects the provisions of the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004. The effect of the Pension Funding Equity Act was to defer a portion of the minimum required contributions that would have been due for the 2004 and 2005 plan years. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid: Pension Other 2006 $ 494 $ 196 2007 561 203 2008 595 204 2009 698 211 2010 682 222 2011 \\x96 2015 3,660 1,198 75 Table of Contents 11.

The Company\\x92s impairment analysis for route acquisition costs did not result in an impairment charge in 2005 or 2004.

Segment Reporting The Company\\x92s operations of American and AMR Eagle are treated as an integrated route network and the route scheduling system maximizes the operating results of the Company. The Company\\x92s chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation decisions to maximize the Company\\x92s consolidated financial results. Based on the way the Company treats the network and the manner in which resource allocation decisions are made, the Company has only one operating segment for financial reporting purposes consisting of the operations of American and AMR Eagle. American is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2005, American provided scheduled jet service to approximately 150 destinations throughout North America, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and Asia. American is also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world, providing a full range of freight and mail services to shippers throughout its system. AMR Eagle owns two regional airlines, which do business as \\x93American Eagle\\x94 - American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. The American Eagle® carriers provide connecting service from eight of American\\x92s high-traffic cities to smaller markets throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. 78 Table of Contents 14. Segment Reporting (Continued) Revenues from other segments are below the quantitative threshold for determining reportable segments and consist primarily of revenues from American Beacon Advisors, Inc. and Americas Ground Services, Inc. The difference between the financial information of the Company\\x92s one reportable segment and the financial information included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets as a result of these entities is not material. The Company\\x92s operating revenues by geographic region (as defined by the Department of Transportation) are summarized below (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 DOT Domestic $ 13,245 $ 12,192 $ 12,687 DOT Latin America 3,568 3,115 2,477 DOT Atlantic 3,115 2,678 1,980 DOT Pacific 784 660 296 Total consolidated revenues $ 20,712 $ 18,645 $ 17,440 The Company attributes operating revenues by geographic region based upon the origin and destination of each flight segment. The Company\\x92s tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which are mobile across geographic markets and, therefore, have not been allocated. 15.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management\\x92s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The term \\x93disclosure controls and procedures\\x94 is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\\x92s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the Company\\x92s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2005. Based on that evaluation, the Company\\x92s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company\\x92s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005. During the quarter ending on December 31, 2005, there was no change in the Company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting. Management\\x92s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control \\x97 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2005, the Company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Management\\x92s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the Company\\x92s consolidated financial statements. Ernst & Young LLP\\x92s attestation report on management\\x92s assessment of the Company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting appears below. /s/ Gerard J. Arpey Gerard J. Arpey Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ James A. Beer James A. Beer Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 80 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Shareholders AMR Corporation We have audited management\\x92s assessment, included in the accompanying Management\\x92s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that AMR Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). AMR Corporation\\x92s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management\\x92s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management\\x92s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\x92s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\x92s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management\\x92s assessment that AMR Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
