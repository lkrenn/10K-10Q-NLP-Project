    This Form 10-K includes certain statements, including statements regarding
the Company's operations which are forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as
"may," "will," "should," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans,"
"believes," "seeks," "estimates," or the negative of such terms and other
comparable terminology. However, this Form 10-K also contains other
forward-looking statements. Such statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions which could
cause Mesa's future results to differ materially from those expressed in any
forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Mesa. Many of such factors
are not under Mesa's ability to control or predict. Readers are cautioned not to
put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Mesa disclaims any intent or
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. See "MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS-FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS."

ITEM 1.      BUSINESS

GENERAL

Mesa Air Group, Inc. ("Mesa" or the "Company") is a holding company whose
principle subsidiaries operate as regional air carriers providing scheduled
passenger and airfreight service, or as companies primarily in support of its
operating airlines. The Company serves over 120 cities in 38 states, the
District of Columbia, Canada, and Mexico. At September 30, 2000, the Company
operated a fleet of 134 aircraft and had approximately 1,000 daily departures.

Approximately 95% of the Company's consolidated airline revenues for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2000, were derived from operations associated with code
share agreements with America West Airlines, Inc. ("America West") and US
Airways, Inc. ("US Airways"). These code share agreements allow use of the code
share partner's reservation system and flight designator code to identify
flights and fares in computer reservation systems, permit use of logos, service
marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to the code share partners
and provide coordinated schedules and joint advertising. Certain of these
agreements also provide for generally favorable fixed fee and cost reimbursement
terms that mitigate certain of the economic risks inherent in the Company's
airline's operations.

In addition to carrying passengers, the Company carries freight and express
packages on its passenger flights and has interline small cargo freight
agreements with many other carriers. The Company also has contracts with the
U.S. Postal Service for carriage of mail to the cities it serves and
occasionally operates charter flights when aircraft are not otherwise used for
scheduled service.

The Company's airline operations are conducted by three airline subsidiaries
using hub-and-spoke route systems:

- -    Mesa Airlines, Inc. ("MAI") operates regional jet and turboprop aircraft as
     America West Express under a code share agreement with America West,
     primarily at America West's Phoenix, Arizona and Columbus, Ohio hubs. It
     also operates regional jets as US Airways Express under a code share
     agreement with US Airways, primarily at US Airways' hubs in Philadelphia,
     Pennsylvania, Charlotte, North Carolina, and at New York LaGuardia and
     Washington National Airports.

- -    Air Midwest, Inc. ("Air Midwest") operates Beechcraft 1900D 19-seat
     turboprops as US Airways Express under three code share agreements with US
     Airways at US Airways' hub operations in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia,
     Pennsylvania, and at Kansas City, Missouri and Tampa, Florida. In November
     2000, the Company entered in an agreement wherein Air Midwest's flights in
     Kansas City will code share with Midwest Express Airlines as well as US
     Airways effective in early calendar 2001. Air Midwest also operates as Mesa
     Airlines from a hub in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Albuquerque hub
     operation is an "Independent Operation" and is not subject to a code
     sharing agreement with a major carrier.

- -    CCAIR, Inc. ("CCAIR") operates turboprop aircraft as US Airways Express
     under a code share agreement with US Airways at US Airways' Charlotte,
     North Carolina hub.

                                       3

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "Mesa," "the "Company," "we,"
"us," or "our," refer to Mesa Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

Mesa is a Nevada corporation, with its principal executive office in Phoenix,
Arizona. In addition to its operating airline subsidiaries, the Company owns
WestAir Holding, Inc., a California corporation and owner of WestAir Commuter
Airlines, Inc. a California corporation ("WestAir"), that ceased operations in
1998.

The Company also has the following subsidiaries:

         -        MPD, Inc., a Nevada corporation, doing business as Mesa Pilot
                  Development operates the Company's training program for new
                  pilots in conjunction with San Juan College in Farmington, New
                  Mexico.

         -        Regional Aircraft Services, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
                  is a subsidiary of WestAir Holdings, Inc. and performs
                  aircraft component repair and overhaul services.

         -        Mesa Leasing, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was established to
                  assist in the acquisition and leasing of aircraft.

         -        MAGI Insurance, Ltd., a Barbados, West Indies based captive
                  insurance company, was established for the purpose of
                  obtaining more favorable liability insurance rates.

         -        Ritz Hotel Management Corp., a Nevada Corporation, was
                  established to facilitate the Company's acquisition and
                  management of a Phoenix area hotel property used for crew
                  accommodations.

         -        FCA, Inc. a Nevada corporation ("FCA"), previously did
                  business as Four Corners Aviation, a fixed based operation in
                  Farmington, New Mexico. During fiscal 1999, substantially all
                  of the assets of FCA were sold and FCA ceased operations.

</TABLE>
As of September 30, 2000, the Company was in the process of realigning its fleet
across its operating subsidiaries. The primary objective of the fleet
realignment is to concentrate all 1900D aircraft into Air Midwest. Historically,
both MAI and Air Midwest operated 1900D aircraft, with each carrier having
separate flight operations, training and maintenance programs. As of December 1,
2000, the Company completed its fleet realignment and all of the Company's
1900D's were being operated by Air Midwest. MAI now operates the Company's
regional jet and Dash 8-200 turboprop aircraft. CCAIR operates the Company's
Jetstream and Dash 8-100 turboprop aircraft.

THE CHANGING REGIONAL AIRLINE MARKET AND CODE SHARE AGREEMENTS

Historically, the key characteristics of the regional airline market have
included:

                                       4
<PAGE>   5
    -   Operating feeder service to major airline hubs for connecting passengers
        under code share arrangements primarily in low density markets which are
        generally unattractive to major airlines;

    -   Providing complimentary service in existing major airline markets by
        operating flights in scheduling gaps between those of the major
        airlines;

    -   Operating turboprop aircraft in support of the major airlines' jet
        networks;

    -   Prorating revenues for connecting customers between the regional and
        major airline while the regional airline operates in relative
        independence with respect to local customers in the regional markets,
        bearing the risks and reaping the rewards from the local customers,
        generally known as " Prorate Agreements."

In recent years, new arrangements, generally known as "Contract Agreements,"
have developed between regional and major airlines. These agreements provide
that all revenues from all customers go to the major airline partner. In return,
the major airline agrees to pay predetermined fees to the regional airline for
operating specified flights at specified times, usually without regard to the
number of passengers onboard. In addition, these agreements generally provide
that certain variable costs, such as fuel and airport landing fees, be
reimbursed 100% by the major airline. These arrangements, when properly
structured, can be attractive to the regional airline in that the majority of
the economic risks are assumed by the major airline partner, leaving the
regional airline with often more predictable costs and revenues than under the
Prorate Agreements.

The Company's airline subsidiaries have agreements with America West and US
Airways to use those major carriers' designation codes (commonly referred to as
a "code share"). These code share agreements allow use of the code share
partner's reservation system and flight designator code to identify flights and
fares in computer reservation systems, permit use of logos, service marks,
aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to the code share partners and
provide coordinated schedules and joint advertising. The Company's passengers
traveling on flights operated pursuant to code share agreements receive mileage
credits in the respective frequent flyer programs of America West and US
Airways, and credits in those programs can be used on flights operated by the
Company. Approximately 95% of the Company's airline revenues for the year ended
September 30, 2000, were derived from operations associated with code share
agreements. The Company's subsidiaries have one code share agreement with
America West and five separate code share agreements with US Airways.

Both the America West code share agreement and the US Airways regional jet code
share agreements are Contract Agreements. Under the terms of these Contract
Agreements, the major carrier controls marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing
and seat inventories. The Company receives a guaranteed payment for each
departure operated and each mile flown, with certain costs, such as fuel and
landing fees, billed directly to the major partner. Among other advantages,
Contract Agreements reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in passenger
traffic and fare levels, as well as fuel prices.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, Mesa's America West Express
operations, all of which were operated pursuant to Contract Agreements,
represented approximately 46% of the Company's available seat mile capacity and
34% of its consolidated passenger revenue. For this same period, US Airways
Express regional jet operations, all of which were also operated pursuant to a
Contract Agreement, represented approximately 27% of the Company's available
seat mile capacity and 20% of its consolidated passenger revenue. Contract
Agreement operations accounted for approximately 73% of capacity, based on
available seat miles, and approximately 54% of passenger revenues on a
consolidated basis.

The Company's four US Airways turboprop code share agreements are Prorate
Agreements, in which the Company is allocated a portion of each passenger's fare
based on a standard industry formula and which require the Company to pay all
the costs of transporting the passenger. For the fiscal year ended September 30,
2000, US Airways Express turboprop operations represented approximately 25% of
the Company's available seat mile capacity and 41% of its consolidated passenger
revenue.

Renewal of one code share agreement with US Airways does not guarantee the
renewal of other code share agreements with US Airways. Code share agreements
provide for terms of seven years for America West, and from two to eight years
for US Airways. Although the provisions of the code share agreements vary from
contract to contract, generally each agreement is subject to cancellation should
the applicable Company subsidiary fail to meet certain operating performance
standards, breach of other contractual terms and conditions and, in the case of
the US Airways code share agreements (other

                                       5
<PAGE>   6
than the regional jet service agreement and the Kansas City code share agreement
described below), upon six months notice by either party. The code share
agreements contain provisions allowing the Company's code share partners to
terminate the agreements upon certain potential operational or "change in
control" events. The code share agreements do not prohibit the major carrier
from having code share relationships with other regional carriers, although the
Company does have exclusive rights from its code share partners on many of the
routes served by the Company's subsidiaries. A termination or expiration without
renewal of the America West or US Airways contract code share agreements or more
than one of the prorate agreements would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

The various code share agreements are summarized as follows:

</TABLE>

(1) In November 2000, the Company and America West amended their Contract
Agreement to expand the number of regional jets operated from 17 to 22 and
extend the term of the agreement for regional jets from 2004 to 2007.

(2) In November 1999 and October 2000, the Company and US Airways amended the US
Airways regional jet service Contract Agreement. The amendments expanded the
number of regional jets operated from 14 to 32 and extended the term from 2004
to 2008. In addition, the amendments eliminated the ability of US Airways to
terminate the Contract Agreement without cause.

(3) In October 2000, the Company and US Airways amended three of its revenue
prorate agreements. The Kansas City agreement was extended from 2000 to 2005. In
addition, the agreement was amended to eliminate the ability of either party to
terminate the agreement without cause and permit the Company to add additional
code share partners in Kansas City. The other two prorate agreements were
extended by one year beyond their previous expiration dates.

In November 2000, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with
Midwest Express Airlines, Inc. ("Midwest Express") to add the Midwest Express
designation code to the Company's operations in Kansas City. The anticipated
start date for the arrangement is the first quarter of calendar 2001. The
agreement will cover 13 cities already served by ten 1900D aircraft.

FLEET PLANS AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURER RELATIONSHIPS

In August 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with Bombardier Regional
Aircraft Division ("BRAD") to acquire 16 CRJ 50-passenger jet aircraft. The
agreement also granted the Company an option to acquire an additional 16 jet
aircraft and provided for additional rolling options to acquire a third block of
16 aircraft. In fiscal 1997, the Company exercised options to purchase 16 of the
32 CRJ aircraft reserved under the option provisions of the BRAD purchase
agreement. The option exercise included the conversion of eight Dash 8-200
aircraft then on order to CRJ 50-passenger jet aircraft. In addition, BRAD
agreed to assume the leases on the Company's inactive fleet of seven Embraer
EMB-120 aircraft upon the delivery of CRJs.

Subsequently, BRAD refused to accept trade-in Embraer EMB-120 aircraft and
failed to provide the 16 CRJ aircraft pursuant to the rolling options held by
the Company. Under the settlement of this dispute, the Company may receive up to
$9.0 million, subject to financing additional aircraft acquisitions by a certain
date. As of September 30, 2000, $7.7 million has been received relative to 29 of
the 32 delivered aircraft. The Company recorded $2.0 million as other income
related to damages from the dispute with BRAD for incremental lease payments,
storage and insurance costs incurred by the Company. The remaining $5.7 million
was recorded as a deferred credit and will be deferred and amortized over the
life of the leased aircraft. For the three remaining aircraft, $1.3 million will
be received when the aircraft are financed pursuant to long-term operating
leases.
                                       6
<PAGE>   7
As of September 30, 2000, the Company has taken delivery of each of the 32 CRJ
aircraft ordered under the BRAD purchase agreement including 16 subject to the
options.

During fiscal 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with Embraer, a
Brazilian aircraft manufacturer, to acquire 36 ERJ-145 50-seat regional jets.
Deliveries commenced in April 2000 and are expected to continue through
mid-calendar 2002. The agreement also grants the Company options to purchase at
least 64 additional ERJ-145 aircraft. The options are at fixed prices, subject
to cost escalations and delivery schedules, and are exercisable through October
2007. Generally, the Company finances the aircraft with U.S. leveraged leases
entered into with various third-party lessors.

In June 2000, the Company introduced its first ERJ into revenue service as US
Airways Express. By the end of March 2002, the Company intends to perform all US
Airways Express regional jet operations with ERJs and all America West Express
regional jet operations with CRJs. The above regional jet allocation is subject
to various contingencies, including the availability of ERJs from Embraer, the
availability of financing for the aircraft, and the willingness of America West
and US Airways to agree to deployment of additional aircraft.

The following summarizes the Company's jet fleet status and current fleet
expansion plans for the periods indicated:

In fiscal 1999, the Company announced its intention to dispose of 30 excess
1900D aircraft. As of September 30, 2000, the Company had disposed of 17 of such
aircraft, and is actively seeking proposals for the disposition of the remaining
13 1900D aircraft. Under an agreement with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation
("RAC"), the Company has the right to sell to Raytheon six 1900D aircraft in
October 2001 and five 1900D aircraft in October 2002.

MARKETING

The Company's flight schedules are structured to facilitate the connection of
its passengers with flights of America West and US Airways at airports where it
serves as a code share partner and maximize local and connecting service to
other carriers in Albuquerque.

Under the Company's US Airways Express turboprop operations, the Company's
market selection process follows an in-depth analysis on a route-by-route basis
and is followed by a review and approval process in a joint effort with US
Airways regarding the level of service and fares. The Company believes that this
selection process enhances the likelihood of profitability in a given market.

Under the America West Express Contract Agreement and the US Airways Express
regional jet Contract Agreement, market selection, pricing and yield management
functions are performed by America West and US Airways, respectively. The
Company's role is simply to operate its fleet in the safest and most reliable
manner in exchange for fees paid under a

                                       7
<PAGE>   8
generally fixed payment schedule. The Company intends to expand its operations
performed pursuant to these Contract Agreements.

Under the Company's code share agreements, America West and US Airways
coordinate advertising and public relations within their respective regions. In
addition, the Company's prorate traffic is impacted by the major airline
partners' advertising programs in regions outside those served by the Company,
with the major partners' customers becoming customers of the Company as a result
of through fares. Under Prorate code share arrangements, the Company's
passengers also benefit from through fare ticketing with the major airline
partners and greater accessibility to the Company's flights on computer
reservation systems and in the Official Airline Guide.

The Company's Prorate Agreement and Independent Operation flights are promoted
through, and the Company's revenues are generally believed to benefit from,
listings in computer reservation systems, the Official Airline Guide and through
direct contact with travel agencies and corporate travel departments. The
Company participates in shared advertising with resort and rental property
operators and ski areas in leisure markets in which it operates. The Company's
non-code share operation utilizes SABRE, a computerized reservation system
widely used by travel agents, corporate travel offices and other airlines. The
reservation systems of the Company's code share partners are also utilized in
each of the Company's other operations through their respective code share
agreements. The Company also pays booking fees to owners of other computerized
reservation systems based on the number of independent and prorate passengers
booked by travel agents using such systems. The Company believes that it has
good relationships with travel agents serving its passengers.

FARES AND CONTRACT AGREEMENT FLYING

The Company has increasingly relied on Contract Agreements with its code share
partners to generate revenue. All of the Company's America West Express and US
Airways Express regional jet operations are on a contract basis. The percentage
of revenue generated under Contract Agreements is expected to increase in future
years as the Company continues to add regional jets to its America West Express
and US Airways Express operations and reduce the number of 1900D aircraft in
operation. In fiscal 2000, the Company generated approximately 54% of its total
operating revenue pursuant to Contract Agreements.

Since 1978, airlines in the United States have generally been free to set their
own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The Company derives its
Independent and Prorate passenger revenues from a combination of local fares,
through fares and joint fares. Local fares are for one-way and round-trip travel
provided by the Company within its route systems. Passengers connecting with
other carriers also frequently use local fares. A through fare is a fare offered
to passengers by a code share partner which generally provides cost savings to
the passenger who transfers to the major carrier's code share partner on routes
flown by the code share partner. Through fares are prorated in accordance with
standards specified in the various code share agreements. Joint fares are single
fares for travel combining the Company's flights with flights of other airlines
that are not code share partners with the Company. Joint fares generally allow a
passenger to pay a single lower fare than the passenger would otherwise have
paid with separate local fares. The Company has been able to negotiate joint
fare arrangements with certain major carriers as an additional means of deriving
passengers connecting through its hub cities.

COMPETITION

The airline industry is highly competitive and volatile. Airlines compete in the
areas of pricing, scheduling (frequency and timing of flights), on-time
performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to
passengers, frequent flyer plans, travel agent commissions and the automation of
travel agent reservation systems. Further, because of the Airline Deregulation
Act, airlines are currently free to set prices and establish new routes without
the necessity of seeking governmental approval. At the same time, deregulation
has allowed airlines to abandon unprofitable routes where the affected
communities will not be left without air service.

The Company believes that the Airline Deregulation Act facilitated the Company's
entry into scheduled air service markets and allows it to compete on the basis
of service and fares, thus causing major carriers to seek out further
contractual agreements with carriers such as the Company as a way of expanding
their respective networks. However, the Airline Deregulation Act makes the entry
of other competitors possible, some of which may have substantial financial
resources and experience, creating the potential for intense competition among
regional air carriers in the Company's markets.

                                       8
<PAGE>   9

The Company believes its code share agreements provide a significant competitive
advantage in hub airports where its major partner has a predominant share of the
market. The ability to control connecting passenger traffic by offering superior
service creates difficulty for other regional airlines wishing to compete at
such hubs. In addition to enhanced competitiveness offered by the code share
agreements, the Company competes with other airlines by offering frequent
flights, flexible schedules and numerous fare levels.

FUEL

Historically, the Company has not experienced problems with the availability of
fuel, and believes that it will be able to obtain fuel in quantities sufficient
to meet its existing and anticipated future requirements at competitive prices.
Standard industry contracts generally do not provide protection against fuel
price increases, nor do they ensure availability of supply. However, the
Company's code share agreement with America West and the regional jet service
agreement with US Airways allow fuel used in the performance of the agreements
to be billed to the code share partner, thereby reducing the Company's exposure
to fuel price fluctuations. In fiscal 2000, approximately 65% of the Company's
fuel was associated with the Company's America West code share and US Airways
regional jet service agreements. A substantial increase in the price of jet
fuel, to the extent the Company's fuel costs are not reimbursed, or the lack of
adequate fuel supplies in the future would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

MAINTENANCE OF AIRCRAFT AND TRAINING

All mechanics and avionics specialists employed by the Company have the
appropriate training and experience and hold the required licenses issued by the
Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"). Using a combination of FAA-certified
maintenance vendors and its own personnel and facilities, the Company maintains
its aircraft on a scheduled and "as-needed" basis. The Company emphasizes
preventive maintenance and inspects its aircraft engines and airframes as
required. The Company also maintains an inventory of spare parts specific to the
aircraft types it flies. The Company provides periodic in-house and outside
training for its maintenance and flight personnel and also takes advantage of
factory training programs that are offered when acquiring new aircraft.

INSURANCE

The Company carries types and amounts of insurance customary in the airline
industry, including coverage for public liability, passenger liability, property
damage, product liability, aircraft loss or damage, baggage and cargo liability
and workers' compensation.

EMPLOYEES

As of September 30, 2000, the Company employed approximately 3,480 employees.
The Company's continued success is partly dependent on its ability to continue
to attract and retain qualified personnel. Historically, the Company has had no
difficulty attracting qualified personnel to meet its requirements. The Company
believes that relations with its employees are favorable.

Pilot turnover at times is a significant issue among regional carriers when
major carriers are hiring experienced commercial pilots away from regional
carriers. The addition of aircraft, especially new aircraft types, can result in
pilots upgrading between aircraft types and becoming unavailable for duty during
the extensive training periods required. No assurances can be made that pilot
turnover and unavailability will not again be a significant problem in the
future, particularly if major carriers expand their operations. Similarly, there
can be no assurance that sufficient numbers of new pilots will be available to
support any future growth.

During December 1996, the Company reached a five-year agreement, expiring in
December, 2001, with the Air Line Pilots Association ("ALPA") for a single pilot
contract for MAI and Air Midwest. Air Midwest mechanics are represented by the
International Association of Machinists ("IAM"), and flight attendants at MAI
are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants ("AFA"). The current
agreement with the IAM is amendable on March 31, 2002 and the AFA contract is
amendable on June 13, 2003. CCAIR has three organized employee groups. ALPA
represents the pilots, AFA represents the flight attendants and the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("Teamsters") represents the mechanics
and stock clerks. The ALPA agreement was renewed on November 6, 1998, and
becomes amendable on October 31, 2002. The AFA

                                       9
<PAGE>   10
agreement was renewed on May 16, 1996, and becomes amendable on May 16, 2001.
The Teamsters mechanics contract was ratified on July 15, 1998, and becomes
amendable on December 31, 2001. The Teamsters stock clerks contract was ratified
July 31, 2000 and becomes amendable on December 31, 2003.

No other Mesa subsidiaries are parties to any other collective bargaining
agreement or union contracts.

ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE PROGRAM

The Essential Air Service program administered by the United States Department
of Transportation ("DOT") guarantees a minimum level of air service in certain
communities, predicated on predetermined guidelines set forth by Congress. Based
on these guidelines, the DOT will subsidize air service to communities that
might not otherwise have air service. The Company services 11 such cities for an
annual subsidy of approximately $5.6 million.

REGULATION

As an interstate air carrier, the Company is subject to the economic
jurisdiction, regulation and continuing air carrier fitness requirements of the
DOT. Such requirements include minimum levels of financial, managerial and
regulatory fitness. The DOT is authorized to establish consumer protection
regulations to prevent unfair methods of competition and deceptive practices, to
prohibit certain pricing practices, to inspect a carrier's books, properties and
records, and to mandate conditions of carriage. The DOT also has the power to
bring proceedings for the enforcement of air carrier economic regulations,
including the assessment of civil penalties, and to seek criminal sanctions.

The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the FAA with respect to its
aircraft maintenance and operations, including equipment, ground facilities,
dispatch, communication, training, weather observation, flight personnel and
other matters affecting air safety. To ensure compliance with its regulations,
the FAA requires airlines to obtain an operating certificate, which is subject
to suspension or revocation for cause, and provides for regular inspections.

Effective March 1997, the FAA required that regional airlines with aircraft of
10 or more passenger seats operating under FAR Part 135 rules to begin operating
those aircraft under FAR Part 121 regulations. The Company, as one of the
largest regional airlines operating under FAR Part 135 regulations, completed
the transition to Part 121 within the FAA's deadline. These requirements have
resulted in a significant increase in the Company's costs, affecting the
Company's ability to profitably serve certain markets. Such increased costs are
primarily related to additional training, dispatch and maintenance procedures.
The Company continues to attempt to minimize the cost of these new operating
procedures while fully complying with FAR Part 121 operating requirements.

The Company is subject to various federal and local laws and regulations
pertaining to other issues of environmental protocol. The Company believes it is
in compliance with all governmental laws and regulations regarding environmental
protection.

The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications
Commission with respect to the use of its radio facilities and the United States
Postal Service with respect to carriage of United States mail. Local governments
in certain markets have adopted regulations governing various aspects of
aircraft operations, including noise abatement and curfews.

FISCAL 2000 VERSUS FISCAL 1999

General

During fiscal 2000, the Company continued the expansion of its regional jet
fleet by taking delivery of 11 additional regional jets (3 CRJs and 8 ERJs). The
Company deployed the additional regional jet aircraft in performing operations
under its code share agreements with America West and US Airways. Additionally,
the Company continued to downsize its Beechcraft 1900D fleet, disposing of 17
1900D aircraft during fiscal 2000. Regional jet aircraft have more seats and
generally fly longer stage lengths than turboprop aircraft. Consequently,
regional jet aircraft provide more available seat miles ("ASMs") and generate
lower revenue and cost per ASM than turboprop aircraft.

Operating Revenues

In fiscal 2000, operating revenues increased by $67.0 million (16.6%) to $471.6
million, compared to $404.6 million in fiscal 1999. The increase was primarily
due to additional revenues from the Company's expanded use of regional jets
pursuant to fee per departure contracts with America West and US Airways.

Capacity, measured by ASMs, increased by 13.7% to 2,951 million in fiscal 2000,
compared to 2,595 million in fiscal 1999. The increase in ASMs was primarily
attributable to the Company's continued implementation of regional jet aircraft
into its fleet, which have more seats and fly longer stage lengths than
turboprop aircraft. Passenger traffic is measured by revenue passenger miles
("RPMs"), which represent one revenue passenger carried one mile. RPMs increased
by 17.8% to 1,561 million in fiscal 2000 as compared to 1,325 million fiscal
1999. The increase in RPMs was primarily due to the Company's expanded use of
regional jets pursuant to fee per departure contracts with America West and US
Airways. Passenger load factor increased to 52.9% in fiscal 2000 from 51.1% in
fiscal 1999. The majority of the Company's revenue is derived from fee per
departure contracts with its major airline partners.

Operating Expenses

Flight Operations

In fiscal 2000, flight operations expense increased 27.9% to $221.8 million (7.5
cents per ASM) from $173.4 million (6.7 cents per ASM) in fiscal 1999. The
increase was primarily due to increased fuel costs of approximately $31.5
million, increased lease costs of approximately $10 million and increased pilot
wages of approximately $3.4 million. These increases were the result of
operating additional regional jets which have higher operating costs than turbo
prop aircraft.

                                       15
<PAGE>   16


Maintenance Expense

In fiscal 2000, maintenance expense increased 8.9% to $83.1 million (2.8 cents
per ASM) from $76.3 million (2.9 cents per ASM) in fiscal 1999. Increased
maintenance expenditures are primarily due to the increased number of time
sensitive maintenance events that occurred in fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2000
maintenance expense was reduced by $4.9 million as a result of the Company's
change in accounting method from the accrual method to the direct expense method
for CRJ and Dash 8-200 aircraft. The Company also elected to adopt the direct
expense method for its new ERJ aircraft. The Company estimates that the change
in method will have a positive impact on earnings over the next eight years.

Aircraft and Traffic Servicing Expense

In fiscal 2000, aircraft and traffic servicing expense decreased 3.9% to $53.5
million (1.8 cents per ASM) from $55.7 million (2.1 cents per ASM) in fiscal
1999. The decrease was primarily due to the Company's continued down sizing of
its B1900D fleet and the consequent reduction in flying under prorate
agreements.

Promotion and Sales

In fiscal 2000, promotion and sales expense decreased 8.2% to $29.9 million (1.0
cents per ASM) from $32.6 million (1.3 cents per ASM) in fiscal 1999. The
decrease is primarily due to the Company's continued down sizing of its B1900D
fleet and the continued expansion of flights performed pursuant to contract
agreements, whereby America West and US Airways assume the responsibility for
promoting and selling seats on flights operated by the Company.

General and Administrative Expense

In fiscal 2000, general and administrative expense decreased 18.3% to $25.9
million (0.9 cents per ASM) from $31.7 million (1.2 cents per ASM) in fiscal
1999. The decrease is due to merger expenses incurred in 1999 related to the
acquisition of CCAIR as well as a decrease in legal expenses. General and
administrative expense consists of items such as administrative payroll, office
rent, professional fees and other items.

Depreciation and Amortization

In fiscal 2000, depreciation and amortization expense decreased 13.4% to $15.6
million (0.5 cents per ASM) from $18.1 million (0.7 cents per ASM) in fiscal
1999. The decrease is primarily due to the cessation of depreciation on parked
1900D aircraft being disposed, which are valued in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of."

Other Operating Items

In fiscal 2000, other operating items were de minimis, while in the prior year,
the Company recorded substantial adjustments related to the shut down of the UAL
code sharing operation and the reversal of $14.0 million of previously
established reserves which were considered to be excess.

FISCAL 1999 VERSUS FISCAL 1998

During fiscal 1999, the Company increased the number of regional jet aircraft in
its fleet from 17 to 29.

Capacity, measured by ASMs, increased by 0.5% to 2,595 million in fiscal 1999,
as compared to 2,582 million in fiscal 1998. The ASM increase resulted from the
Company's continued implementation of regional jet aircraft into its fleet,
offset by fewer 1900D and EMB-120 aircraft associated with the United Express
operation. Passenger traffic, measured by RPMs, decreased 5.9% in fiscal 1999 as
compared to fiscal 1998. The passenger load factor decreased from 54.5% to
51.1%, yield (passenger revenue per RPM) decreased by 4.2 cents in 1999 from
34.3 cents per RPM, and revenue per ASM decreased to 15.3 cents from 18.7 cents
per ASM in fiscal 1998. The decrease in RPMs was due primarily to the reduction
in flying from the United Express operations terminated in 1998. The decreases
in yield and revenue per ASM primarily result from Mesa's aforementioned
increase in regional jet flying.



                                       16
<PAGE>   17
Operating revenues decreased by $90 million (18.2%) for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1999 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was
primarily due to the inclusion in 1998 of revenues associated with the since
terminated United Express operation. Capacity, measured by ASMs, increased by
0.5% due to the continued addition of regional jet aircraft into Mesa's fleet,
offset by fewer B1900 and EMB120 aircraft associated with the United Express
operation. Passenger traffic, measured by revenue passenger miles ("RPMs") and
representing one passenger carried one mile, decreased by 5.9%. The passenger
load factor decreased from 54.5% to 51.1%, yield (passenger revenue per RPM)
decreased by 4.2 cents in 1999 from 34.3 cents per RPM, and revenue per ASM
decreased to 15.3 cents from 18.7 cents per ASM in fiscal 1998. The decrease in
RPMs was due primarily to the reduction in flying from the United Express
operations terminated in 1998. The decreases in load factor, yield and revenue
per ASM primarily result from Mesa's aforementioned increase in regional jet
flying.

Flight Operations expense decreased by 11.1% to $173.4 million (6.7 cents per
ASM) for the 1999 fiscal year, from $195.0 million (7.6 cents per ASM) for the
comparable period in 1998, primarily due to the discontinuation of the United
Express operation. Flight operations expense increased as a percentage of
revenue due to additional costs, primarily pilots and flight attendants,
associated with regional jet aircraft. Fuel costs, pilot costs, and dispatch
costs all declined for the 1999 fiscal year, as compared to the prior period.
Pilot training costs also declined compared to the prior period, primarily due
to the inclusion in fiscal year 1998 of a major portion of training expenses
associated with integrating CRJ aircraft into the fleet.

Maintenance costs decreased by 24.6% to $76.3 million (2.9 cents per ASM) for
the 1999 fiscal year, from $101.2 million (3.9 cents per ASM) for the prior
year. Decreased maintenance costs are the result of a smaller fleet and the
continued introduction of new, warranted CRJ aircraft.

Aircraft and Traffic Servicing costs decreased by 29.2% to $55.7 million (2.1
cents per ASM) during fiscal 1999 from $78.7 million (3.0 cents per ASM) in
fiscal 1998. Station wages decreased due to a reduction in staffing. Station
rent decreased in fiscal 1999 from fiscal 1998 due to the elimination of the
United Express West Coast and Denver operations.

Promotion and Sales expense decreased by 51.9% to $32.6 million (1.3 cents per
ASM) during fiscal 1999 from $67.7 million (2.6 cents per ASM) in fiscal 1998.
This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in booking fees charged
to Mesa for processing reservations on computer reservation systems. Mesa's
contract with America West eliminates booking fees and travel agency commissions
being charged directly to Mesa, and thus these expenses are expected to continue
to decrease in fiscal 2000.

Depreciation and amortization decreased by $8.5 million to $18.1 million in
fiscal 1999 and interest expense decreased by $6.3 million to $19.1 million in
such period. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to fewer
aircraft being depreciated in fiscal year 1999 compared to fiscal year 1998. The
decrease in interest expense was due to the retirement of aircraft, the proceeds
of which were used to pay down debt secured by such aircraft.

During the fourth quarter of 1999, pursuant to the ongoing review and evaluation
of its operations, management elected to cease service on several routes flown
by Beech 1900D aircraft. Management had historically employed numerous
strategies in attempting to establish profitability on the routes but ultimately
determined that undue effort and expense would be required in continuing to
attempt to establish profitability. In connection with the cessation of service,
$8.3 million of goodwill associated with the routes was determined to be
unrecoverable and therefore charged to expense.

In connection with the cessation of service described above, Mesa determined
that 30 Beech 1900D aircraft would no longer be required in scheduled service
and were therefore impaired. Mesa planned to dispose of the 30 aircraft during
fiscal 2000. Mesa recognized an impairment loss amounting to approximately $20.6
million. The amount of the impairment was determined by comparing the net book
value of the aircraft against data provided by Raytheon Aircraft Corporation
(RAC), the manufacturer of the aircraft, on current resale values for aircraft
of comparable age and condition.

During fiscal 1998 and 1997, Mesa recognized expected costs and expenses
amounting to approximately $33.9 million and $72.1 million, respectively, for
the termination of the United Express Operations which included the non-renewal
of the WestAir, and early termination of the MAI, code-sharing agreements with
UAL. These costs and expenses are included in other operating items. (See
footnotes 12 and 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
additional discussion.) Both the $33.9 million and the $72.1 million provide for
the estimated loss on retirement or sale of aircraft, parts, and equipment which
were surplus to the needs of Mesa upon expiration and early termination of the
UAL code

                                       17
<PAGE>   18
sharing agreements. In fiscal 1998, Mesa also recognized provisions amounting to
$4.0 million for the termination of the Ft. Worth jet operations and $2.5
million for the settlement of a shareholder lawsuit.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $34.1
million at September 30, 2000, compared to cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities of $56.2 million at September 30, 1999. The principal source of funds
during fiscal 2000 was approximately $33.2 million generated from operations.
During fiscal 2000, the Company invested approximately $40.2 million in aircraft
parts and other fixed assets, reduced long-term debt by $8.1 million and
repurchased approximately $10.8 million of its common stock. The above factors,
among others, resulted in a $25.9 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities during fiscal 2000 which comprises the majority of the
decrease noted above.

As of September 30, 2000, the Company had receivables of approximately $41.7
million, compared to $30.9 million at September 30, 1999. The amounts due
consist primarily of receivables due from the Company's code share partners and
passenger ticket receivables due through the Airline Clearing House ("ACH").
(Under the terms of the US Airways code share agreements, the Company receives a
substantial portion of its revenues through the ACH.)

In January 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Embraer to acquire
36 50-passenger Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets at an aggregate list price of
approximately $702 million. Deliveries began in April 2000 and are expected to
continue through the summer months of calendar 2002. The Company expects to
finance the aircraft with long-term operating lease arrangements. The Company
also has options for an additional 64 ERJ aircraft, with the right to convert
the options into firm orders for ERJ-145 regional jets or 37-passenger ERJ-135
regional jets. In conjunction with this purchase agreement, the Company placed
an $11.8 million deposit with Embraer during fiscal 1999.

The Company has significant long-term lease obligations primarily relating to
its aircraft fleet. The leases are classified as operating leases and are
therefore excluded from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. At September
30, 2000, the Company leased 93 aircraft with remaining lease terms ranging from
1 to 17 years. Future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating
leases were approximately $1,110 million at September 30, 2000.

The Company's long-term debt was primarily incurred pursuant to the acquisition
of 1900D aircraft. At September 30, 2000 the Company owned 51 1900D aircraft
securing debt with maturities through 2011. In September 2000, the Company sold
16 1900D aircraft to Raytheon for approximately the amount of the underlying
debt of $43.8 million. Effective with the transaction, the Company became
current on the Raytheon debt. Any event of default that may have occurred has
been deemed to be fully cured pursuant to the terms of the agreement with
Raytheon.

In December 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company's
purchase of up to 10% of the outstanding shares of its common stock. As of
September 30, 2000, the Company had acquired and retired approximately 2.0
million shares (approximately 5.7%) of its outstanding common stock at an
aggregate cost of approximately $10.8 million. Purchases are made at
management's discretion based on market conditions and the Company's financial
resources.

The Company has negotiated 10-year engine maintenance contracts with General
Electric Aircraft Engines for its CRJ aircraft, Rolls-Royce Allison for its ERJ
aircraft and Pratt and Whitney, Canada Aircraft Services for its Dash 8-200
aircraft. The contracts provide for payment at the time of the repair event for
a fixed dollar amount per flight hour, subject to escalation based on changes in
certain price indices, for the number of flight hours incurred since the
previous event.

In December 2000, the Company reached an agreement with Fleet Capital for a $35
million revolving line of credit, secured by the Company's inventory and
receivables. The agreement, which expires in December 2003, has provisions which
allow the expansion of available credit to $50 million by adding other lenders.
The Company intends to use the facility for general working capital purposes.

Management believes that the Company will have adequate cash flow to meet its
operating needs. This is a forward-looking statement. Actual cash flows could
materially differ from this forward looking statement as a result of many
factors, including the termination of one or more code share agreements; failure
to sell, dispose of, or redeploy excess aircraft in a timely manner; a
substantial decrease in the number of routes allocated to the Company under its
code share agreements with it code share partners; reduced levels of passenger
revenue, additional taxes or costs of compliance with

                                       18

governmental regulations; fuel cost increases; increases in competition;
increases in interest rates; general economic conditions and unfavorable
settlement of existing litigation.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
in the statement of financial position and measure such instruments at fair
value. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 133." SFAS No. 137 deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to
all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company
adopted the provisions of this statement on October 1, 2000. There was no impact
on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements" SAB No. 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Adoption of SAB No. 101 did not
have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

ITEM 7A -- QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company has exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest
rates related primarily to its debt obligations and short-term marketable
investment portfolio. The Company's debt obligations are primarily variable in
rate and therefore have exposure to change in interest rates. A 10% change in
interest rates would result in approximately $1.5 million impact on interest
expense. The Company also has investments in debt securities. If short-term
interest rates were to average 10% more than they did in fiscal year 2000, there
would be no material impact on the Company's interest income. The Company's
investments in equity securities are subject to market risk related to
fluctuations in share prices for those shares held. A 10% change in the price of
trading securities held at the level of investment at September 30, 2000 would
impact the results of the Company by approximately $0.6 million.

The Company has exposure to certain market risks associated with its aircraft
fuel. Aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier and
even marginal changes greatly impact a carrier's profitability. Standard
industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price
increases, nor do they insure availability of supply. However, both the US
Airways and America West contract code share agreements allow fuel costs to be
passed directly back to the code share partner, thereby reducing Mesa's overall
exposure to fuel price fluctuations. In fiscal 2000, 65% of the Company's fuel
requirements were associated with these contracts. Each one cent change in the
price of jet fuel amounts to a $0.3 million change in annual fuel costs for that
portion of fuel expense which cannot be passed on to either America West or US
Airways.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Form 10-K contains certain statements including, but not limited to,
information regarding the replacement, deployment, and acquisition of certain
numbers and types of aircraft, and projected expenses associated therewith;
costs of compliance with FAA regulations and other rules and acts of Congress;
the passing of taxes, fuel costs, inflation, and various expenses to the
consumer; the relocation of certain operations of Mesa; the resolution of
litigation in a favorable manner and certain projected financial obligations.
These statements, in addition to statements made in conjunction with the words
"expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," and
similar expressions, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Safe Harbor provision of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. These
statements relate to future events or the future financial performance of Mesa
and only reflect Management's expectations and estimates. The following is a
list of factors, among others, that could cause actual results to differ
materially from the forward-looking statements: changing business conditions in
certain market segments and industries; an increase in competition along the
routes Mesa operates or plans to operate; material delays in completion by the
manufacturer of the ordered and yet-to-be delivered aircraft; changes in general
economic conditions; changes in fuel price; changes in regional economic
conditions; Mesa's relationship with

                                       19

employees and the terms of future collective bargaining agreements; and the
impact of current and future laws, Congressional investigations, and
governmental regulations affecting the airline industry and Mesa's operations;
bureaucratic delays; amendments to existing legislation; consumers unwilling to
incur greater costs for flights; unfavorable resolution of negotiations with
municipalities for the leasing of facilities; and risks associated with
litigation outcomes. One or more of these or other factors may cause Mesa's
actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Mesa is
not undertaking any obligation to update any forward-looking statements
contained in this Form 10-K.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Mesa Air Group, Inc.
Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Mesa Air Group,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss and of
cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such 2000 consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Mesa Air Group, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, effective October 1, 1999,
the Company changed its method of accounting for certain maintenance costs.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                  YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, 1999 AND 1998

1.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation and Organization

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and include the accounts of Mesa Air Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries (collectively Mesa or the Company): Mesa Airlines, Inc. ("MAI"), a
Nevada corporation and certificated air carrier; WestAir Holdings, Inc., a
California corporation and owner of certificated air carrier WestAir Commuter
Airlines, Inc. (WestAir Commuter Airlines, Inc. ceased operations in 1998); Air
Midwest, Inc. ("Air Midwest"), a Kansas corporation and certificated air
carrier; CCAIR, Inc. ("CCAIR"), a Delaware corporation and certificated air
carrier; MPD, Inc., a Nevada corporation, doing business as Mesa Pilot
Development; FCA, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, doing business as Four Corners
Aviation (in fiscal 1999, substantially all of the assets of FCA, Inc. were sold
and FCA, Inc. ceased operations); Mesa Leasing, Inc., a Nevada corporation and
MAGI Insurance, Ltd., a Barbados, West Indies based captive insurance company.
MPD, Inc. provides pilot training in coordination with a community college. MAGI
Insurance, Ltd. is a captive insurance company created to handle freight and
baggage claims in addition to a portion of the Company's aviation insurance. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation

The Company's airline subsidiaries have agreements (commonly referred to as
"code share") with America West (one agreement) and US Airways (five separate
agreements) to provide scheduled airline service using the branding and many of
the marketing functions and benefits of the major carriers. Approximately 95%,
96% and 96% of the Company's airline revenues for the years ended September 30,
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, were derived from code share agreements.
Amounts included in accounts receivable as a percentage of the Company's total
accounts receivable from the code share partners were 33% and 12% at September
30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The America West agreement and the US Airways regional jet agreement are
contract agreements, wherein the Company receives guaranteed payments for each
flight operated, based on the terms of the contracts. Certain variable costs
such as fuel are passed directly to the Company's partners in these contract
agreements.

The Company's four US Airways turboprop code share agreements are prorate
agreements, in which the Company is allocated a portion of each passenger's fare
based on a standard industry formula, and requires the Company to pay all of the
costs of transporting the passenger.

Renewal of one code share agreement with a code share partner does not guarantee
the renewal of any other code share agreement with the same code share partner.
The agreement with America West has a seven-year term, and the agreements with
US Airways vary from two to eight years. Although the provisions of the code
share agreements vary from contract to contract, generally each agreement is
subject to cancellation should the Company's subsidiaries fail to meet certain
operating performance standards, breach other contractual terms and conditions
and, in the case of the US Airways code share agreements (other than the
regional jet service agreement and the Kansas City code share agreement
described below), upon six months notice by either party.

A termination or expiration without renewal of the America West or US Airways
contract code share agreements, or more than one of the prorate agreements would
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business prospects, financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company also operates as Mesa Airlines from a hub in Albuquerque, New
Mexico. The Albuquerque hub operation is not subject to a code share agreement.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2000, the Company
had $ 2.8 million of cash restricted as collateral for letters of credit.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities consist of shares of common stock and are stated at market
value as determined by the most recently traded price of each security at the
balance sheet date. All marketable securities are defined as trading securities
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."

Receivables

The passenger tickets collected by the Company at the time of travel are
primarily sold by the code share partners as discussed above. As a result, the
Company has a significant concentration of its Accounts receivable tied to its
relationship with these code share partners. In additions, the Company generally
has substantial receivable from its code share partners related to its contract
revenues.

Expendable Parts and Supplies

Expendable parts and supplies are stated at the lower of cost using the
first-in, first-out method or market, and are charged to expense as they are
used.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives to their estimated salvage values using the straight line method.

 Estimated useful lives of the various classifications of property and equipment
are as follows:
<TABLE>

</TABLE>

Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may
not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and
used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. Certain long-lived
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair
value less cost to sell.

Interest related to deposits on aircraft purchase contracts is capitalized as
part of the aircraft. The Company capitalized approximately $1.5 million and
$0.9 million of interest in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Intangible Assets

The Company evaluates the recoverability of its intangible assets by measuring
the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash
flows associated with such assets. At the time such evaluations indicate that
the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying
value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values.

The fiscal 1991 purchase of Air Midwest resulted in purchased intangible
goodwill of approximately $10.2 million, which is amortized over a 20-year
period. The unamortized cost of goodwill was reduced to approximately $4.7
million in 1999 as

                                       29
<PAGE>   30
a result of tax benefits realized through utilization of net operating loss and
investment tax credit carryovers acquired in the Air Midwest purchase.

In fiscal 1994, the Company entered into separate asset purchase agreements
related to developing its operations as US Airways Express. Resulting goodwill
of approximately $21.8 million is amortized over a 20-year period. During fiscal
1999, the Company determined that the goodwill amount related to a separately
identified segment of the acquired US Airways Express operations was impaired
and, accordingly, a charge of approximately $8.3 million was recognized to
write-off the unamortized balance of the asset.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in future
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return.

Deferred Credits

Deferred credits consist of lease incentives received at lease inception and
other credits related to the aircraft and are amortized on a straight-line basis
as a reduction of lease expense over the term of the respective leases.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Pursuant to Prorate
Agreements and in the Independent Operation, tickets sold but not yet used are
included in air traffic liability. The Company receives subsidies for providing
scheduled air service to certain small or rural communities. Such revenue is
recognized in the period to which the payments relate. The amount of the subsidy
payments is determined by the United States Department of Transportation on the
basis of its evaluation of the amount of revenue needed to meet operating
expenses and to provide a reasonable return on investment with respect to
eligible routes.

Maintenance Expense

The normal cost of recurring maintenance is charged to expense as incurred.
Effective October 1, 1999, the Company elected to change its method of
accounting for engine and airframe maintenance costs on its Canadair regional
jet aircraft and engine maintenance on its Dehavilland Dash 8-200 aircraft from
the accrual method to the direct expense method (see note 2). The Company now
uses the direct expense method for all maintenance. Prior to the change, the
Company used the accrual method for these aircraft.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

The Company accounts for earnings (loss) per share in accordance with SFAS No.
128, "Earnings per Share." Basic net income per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the periods presented. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options were exercised. The
calculation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding is as follows:

</TABLE>

The effect of certain options to purchase 605,000 and 447,000 shares of common
stock in fiscal 1999 and 1998 would have been antidilutive to the per share
calculation. Accordingly, those options were excluded from the calculation.

Stock Options

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations.
Effective October 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," which permits entities to recognize the fair value of
all stock-based awards on the date of grant over the vesting period.
Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 also allows entities to continue to apply the
measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net earnings
and pro-forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants
made in fiscal 1996 and future years as if the fair value based measurement
method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to
continue to apply the measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, and to
provide pro-forma disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. (See note 9.)

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Segment Reporting

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information." The statement requires disclosures related
to components of a company for which separate financial information is available
that is evaluated regularly by a company's chief operating decision maker in
deciding the allocation of resources and assessing performance. The Company is
engaged in one line of business, the scheduled and chartered transportation of
passengers, which constitutes nearly all of its operating revenues.

Comprehensive Income

The Company reports comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No. 130,
"Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes a standard for
reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in the
consolidated financial statements. Comprehensive income includes charges and
credits to stockholders' equity that are not the results of transactions with
shareholders.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No.
133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
and hedging activities and requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure
such instruments at fair value. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137,


                                       31
<PAGE>   32
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133." SFAS No. 137 deferred the effective
date of SFAS No. 133 to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2000. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a material effect on the
Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements" SAB No. 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Adoption of SAB No. 101 did not
have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications were made to the 1999 and 1998 financial statements to
conform to the 2000 presentation.

2. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

Effective October 1, 1999, the Company elected to change its method of
accounting for engine and airframe maintenance costs on its CRJ aircraft and
engine maintenance on its DeHavilland Dash 8-200 aircraft from the accrual
method to the direct expense method. Under the accrual method, maintenance costs
were accrued to expense on the basis of estimated future costs and estimated
cycles or flight hours between major maintenance events. Implementation of the
change necessitated the write-off of previously recorded accrued amounts.
Effective October 1, 1999, the Company expensed these maintenance costs as they
are incurred. The cumulative effect of the change for prior years was a
favorable adjustment of $18.1 million, net of tax. Due to the valuation
allowance at October 1, 1999, there is no tax effect related to the cumulative
effect of the change. The impact of the change in fiscal 2000 totaled
approximately $4.9 million, which is included as a reduction of maintenance
expense.

The pro forma results, assuming that the accounting change was applied
retroactively, is shown below (in thousands, except per share data):

3. MERGER WITH CCAIR

Effective June 9, 1999, Mesa Merger Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company, merged with and into CCAIR. In connection therewith, the Company
issued approximately 5.9 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all
of the outstanding common stock of CCAIR.

The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30,
1999 and 1998 have been restated to include the results of CCAIR.

Combined results are as follows (in thousands): Combined and separate results of

The combined financial information contains adjustments to conform the
accounting policies of the two companies. This conforming adjustment reflects
the restatement of CCAIR's engine overhaul amounts to the direct expense method
from the accrual method from July 1, 1997 forward. Mesa owned 300,000 shares of
common stock in CCAIR prior to the merger, which has been accounted for as a
stock repurchase as of the date acquired.

The consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 1998 have
not been restated to change CCAIR's fiscal year from December 31, 1998 to
September 30. Those consolidated financial statements include the Company's
results of operations on a September 30 fiscal year and CCAIR's for the twelve
month period ended December 31, 1998. CCAIR changed its fiscal year end from
June 30 to December 31 in 1997. The year ends have been conformed beginning
October 1, 1998 and include CCAIR's results of operations for the quarter ended
December 31, 1998, which results were also included in its year ended December
31, 1998. CCAIR reflected net income from operations for the quarter of $120,000
which has been reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.


4. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

The Company has a cash management program which provides for the investment of
excess cash balances primarily in short-term money market instruments,
intermediate-term debt instruments and common equity securities of companies
operating in the airline industry.

SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities", requires that all applicable investments be classified as trading
securities, available for sale securities or held to maturity securities. All of
the Company's investments are classified as trading securities during the
periods presented and accordingly, are carried at market value with changes in
value reflected in current period operations.

From time to time, the Company enters into short positions on common equity
securities when management believes that the Company may capitalize on downward
moves in particular securities. The Company marks short positions to market at
each reporting period with changes in value reflected in current period
earnings. Included in marketable securities are liabilities related to short
positions on common equity securities of $3.0 million at September 30, 2000.
Trading gains and (losses) for the period that relate to trading securities held
at September 30, 2000 and 1999 were ($538,177) and $167,000, respectively.

Deferred credits include lease incentives which are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the life of the lease. The fiscal 2000 balance includes approximately
$5.7 million related to a settlement reached with Bombardier Regional Aircraft
Division ("BRAD") which is being amortized over the life of the aircraft leases.
The unamortized amount totaled $4.6 million at September 30, 2000.

At September 30, 1999, Mesa determined that 30 surplus Beech 1900D aircraft
would be disposed of and an impairment charge of $20.6 million was recorded.
During fiscal 2000, 17 of the planes were sold. Sixteen of the 17 planes were
sold to Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation ("RACC") for the approximate amount
of the underlying notes. A gain of approximately $0.2 million resulted from the
transaction which will be amortized over the remaining RACC debt. Additionally,
the sales agreement provides the Company with an option to sell 11 aircraft to
RACC in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 at approximately $2.9 million per aircraft
which approximates the value of the underlying debt. Unpaid amounts

associated with aircraft held for sale at September 30, 2000 and classified as a
current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet totaled $39.5
million.


8. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE AND RETIREMENT

In December 1999, the Company's board of directors authorized the repurchase, at
management's discretion, of up to 10% of the Company's outstanding shares of
common stock. The Company's purchases are retired and result in a reduction of
stockholders' equity. As of September 30, 2000, the Company had acquired
approximately 2.0 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of
approximately $10.8 million.

Deferred tax assets include benefits expected to be realized from the
utilization of minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.8 million
which do not expire and net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $93.5
million which expire at various dates between 2002 and 2018, respectively. In
addition, CCAIR has $14.5 million in net operating loss carryforwards which are
subject to certain limitations and expire at various dates between 2006 and
2018. During fiscal 1999, the valuation allowance was increased by approximately
$5.4 million. During 2000, the $28.5 million valuation allowance was reversed,
as the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future
operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax
asset.

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

At September 30, 2000, the Company sponsored the following stock-based
compensation plans:

In March 1993, and December 1994, the Company adopted stock option plans for
outside directors. These plans originally provided for the grant of options for
up to 450,000 shares of common stock at fair market value on the date of grant.
These are formula-based plans under which options to acquire 210,245 shares have
been granted and are still outstanding. At September 30, 2000, no options are
available for grant under this plan.

On December 1, 1995, the Company adopted an employee stock option plan under the
new management incentive program (Omnibus Plan) which provided for the granting
of options to purchase up to 2,800,000 shares of Company common stock at the
fair market value on the date of grant. On July 24, 1998, an additional
1,500,000 options were approved by the stockholders to be granted under this
plan. At September 30, 2000, options to acquire 2,902,527 common shares had been
granted that were still outstanding.

On June 1, 1998, the Company adopted a Key Officer Stock Option Plan, which
provided for the granting of options to purchase up to 1,600,000 shares of the
Company's common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. Under this
plan, 1,525,000 options have been granted and options to acquire 75,000 shares
are available for future grants.

In 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan and issued
options to acquire 189,527 shares in connection with the CCAIR merger. No
further options are available for grant under this plan.

Generally, options granted to employees vest over a three-year period and
options granted to directors vest immediately upon grant.

Transactions involving stock options under these plans are summarized as
follows:

The Company applies the provisions of APB No. 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized for awards made pursuant to its fixed stock option
plans. Had the compensation cost for Mesa's four fixed stock-based compensation
plans been determined consistent with the measurement provisions of SFAS No.

11. BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a 401(K) plan covering the employees of MAI, Air Midwest and the
airline support operations (the Mesa Plan). Under the Mesa Plan, employees may
contribute up to 15 percent of their annual compensation, as defined, with the
Company making matching contributions of 50 percent of employee contributions up
to 10 percent of annual employee compensation. Upon completing three years of
service, the employee is 20 percent vested in employer contributions and the
remainder of the employer contributions vest 20 percent per year thereafter.
Employees become fully vested in employer contributions after completing seven
years of employment. The Company has the right to terminate the 401(k) plans at
any time. Contributions by the Company to the Mesa and WestAir Plans for the
years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were approximately $.7 million,
$1.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

The Company also has a 401(k) plan covering the employees of CCAIR. The CCAIR
plan allows employees to defer up to 17% of annual compensation. Company
matching contributions vary in accordance with labor agreements in force for
contract employees. For non-contract employees, the match is determined annually
by the Company's Board of Directors. Upon completing two years of service, the
employee is 20 percent vested in employer contributions and the remainder of the
employer contributions vest 20 percent per year. Employees become fully vested
in employer contributions after completing six years of employment.
Contributions by CCAIR to this plan were approximately $0.3 million and $0.4
million in fiscal 2000 and 1998, respectively. There were no contributions made
in fiscal 1999.


12. LEASE COMMITMENTS

At September 30, 2000, the Company leased 93 aircraft under non-cancelable
operating leases with remaining terms of up to 17 years. The aircraft leases
require the Company to pay all taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating
expenses. The Company has the option to terminate certain of the leases at
various times throughout the lease. At September 30, 2000, three CRJ aircraft
are subject to interim financing agreements. The Company expects to replace
these interim arrangements with long-term operating leases and, accordingly,
requirements under the interim arrangements are included in the minimum lease
commitment table below.

Aggregate rental expense totaled approximately $63.0 million, $46.9 million (net
of approximately $8.0 million in aircraft rental payments recorded against the
United Express code-share provision (note 16)) and $53.6 million for the years
ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 respectively.

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

In fiscal 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with Embraer to acquire 36
fifty-seat ERJ-145 ("ERJ") regional jets. The Company secured the order with an
$11.8 million deposit. The Company also received options to purchase 64
additional aircraft. Deliveries commenced in April 2000 and are expected to
continue through 2002 at a rate of approximately one aircraft per month. The
transaction includes standard product support provisions, including training
support, preferred initial provisioning pricing, maintenance support and
technical publication support. The aggregate value of the 36 ERJs to be acquired
under the agreement is approximately $702 million.

The Company has negotiated 10-year engine maintenance contracts with General
Electric Aircraft Engines ("GE") and Pratt and Whitney, Canada Aircraft Services
("PWC"). The GE contract provides coverage for engines on the Company's CRJ
aircraft. The PWC contract provides coverage for engines on the Company's Dash
8-200 aircraft. Both contracts provide for payment at the time of the repair
event for a fixed dollar amount per flight hour, subject to escalation based on
changes in the CPI, for the number of flight hours incurred since the previous
repair event.

The Company is also a party to various legal proceedings and claims arising in
the ordinary course of business. Although the ultimate outcome of pending
lawsuits cannot be determined, the Company believes, based upon currently
available information, that the ultimate outcome of all the proceedings and
claims pending against the Company will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company's consolidated financial position.

14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT DISCLOSURE

    The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, refundable
income taxes, accounts payable, income taxes payable, accrued compensation and
other liabilities approximate fair values due to the short maturity periods of
these instruments. The fair value of securities is based on quoted marked prices
(see note 3). The carrying value of the Company's long-term debt approximates
fair value based on the current terms offered for debt of the same or similar
remaining maturities. The difference between the estimated fair values and
carrying values of the Company's financial instruments is not material.

In November 1997, WestAir received written notice from UAL that WestAir's
code-sharing agreement would not be renewed. On several occasions subsequent to
November 1997, management sought a reconsideration of UAL's decision not to
renew the WestAir code-sharing agreement. In January 1998, UAL confirmed that it
would not reconsider renewing WestAir's code-sharing agreement upon its
expiration. WestAir had significant assets in excess of its needs upon
expiration of the agreement on May 31, 1998. Accordingly, by resolution of the
Board of Directors on January 10, 1998, the Company recognized a provision to
provide for the cost of discontinuation of WestAir operations.

The $72.1 million provision recognized in fiscal 1997 provided for the estimated
loss on the retirement or sale of aircraft, parts and equipment which were
surplus to the needs of Mesa upon expiration and early termination of the
code-share agreements. In addition, the provision included an estimate for all
other anticipated costs of discontinuation of the WestAir, Denver and Pacific
Northwest operations. The provision consisted of an impairment charge of $26.3
million for the Denver intangibles; $39.5 million for costs to sell or retire
aircraft and related parts and equipment; and $6.3 million for severance and
other costs.

On January 22, 1998, the Company received notice from UAL of the termination of
the Company's code-sharing agreement covering the Denver, Pacific Northwest and
Los Angeles markets to be effective April 22, 1998. UAL also terminated
WestAir's markets in the Pacific Northwest as of April 22, 1998. The Company
notified UAL that the Company considered


                                       39
<PAGE>   40
the termination notice, although improper, wrongful and arbitrary, to have been
effective as of February 6, 1998, 15 days after issuance of the January 22, 1998
termination notice in accordance with the termination provisions of the
contract. All service to these markets was discontinued by April 22, 1998. UAL's
new code share partners for these markets did not require (and therefore
purchase) the Company's aircraft and equipment associated with these operations.
Consequently, the Company recorded a $33.9 million charge in fiscal 1998 to
provide for costs to dispose of or reposition certain aircraft, as well as other
costs to shut down the Denver system.

Termination of the Company's and WestAir's code-sharing agreement with UAL
resulted in a surplus of 21 British Aerospace Jetstream 31 aircraft, 29 Embraer
EMB-120 aircraft, 39 1900D aircraft and 11 Dash-8 aircraft. The Jetstream 31
aircraft, the EMB-120 aircraft and the Dash-8 aircraft are subject to long-term
leases. Although the surplus 1900D Beech aircraft are not specifically
identified, the majority of these aircraft are owned with an average net book
value of approximately $3.3 million per aircraft.

The Company recognized a charge of approximately $4.0 million during fiscal 1998
to provide for expenses arising from the closure of facilities associated with
the Fort Worth, Texas independent jet operation and repositioning of the related
aircraft.

The changes in the restructuring reserves related to the UAL code-share
agreements and the Ft. Worth operations are summarized as follows:

Mesa believes that the reserves remaining at September 30, 2000 will be adequate
to satisfy any remaining costs associated with the UAL Code Share Agreement
cancellations.


18. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

In August 1998, CCAIR entered into a letter agreement with Barlow Partners, L.P.
("Barlow") pursuant to which Barlow agreed to act as CCAIR's exclusive financial
advisor with respect to possible business combinations involving CCAIR. Under
the terms of that agreement, Barlow received a fee from CCAIR equal to two
percent (2%) of the aggregate consideration paid by Mesa upon the closing of the
merger transaction ($1.1 million). Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of Mesa, and James Swigart, member of the Board of
Directors of Mesa, are partners in Barlow. George Murnane III, member of the
CCAIR Board of Directors, is also a partner in Barlow. Upon the completion of
the merger, Mr. Murnane became a member of the Mesa Board of Directors.

On September 9, 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with International
Airline Support Group ("IASG") whereby Mesa would consign certain surplus
airplane parts to IASG to sell on the open market. IASG in turn would submit
proceeds to Mesa less a market-based fee. During fiscal 2000, the Company paid
IASG approximately $611,000 in commissions on sales of surplus aircraft parts.
Additionally, the Company has leased an aircraft auxiliary power unit from IASG
at a normal commercial monthly rate of $10,000 or $120,000 per year. In fiscal
1999, the Company paid IASG approximately $700,000 in commissions for selling
surplus Westair inventory as well as $250,000 in fees in connection with the
shut down of Westair and distribution and protection of certain of its assets.
George Murnane, III, a member of the Board of Directors of Mesa, is a member of
executive management and the Board of Directors of IASG.

In February 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with Barlow whereby
Barlow would provide financial advisory services related to aircraft leases,
mergers and acquisitions, and route profitability. Fees totaling $120,000 and
$105,000 were paid to Barlow in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. Under terms
of the Barlow agreement, Barlow is required to repay these fees to the Company
at such time as Barlow receives fees, if any, from leasing companies that it has
arranged to participate in the Company's various aircraft financings. In fiscal
2000, Barlow repaid the Company the aggregate of $225,000 in connection with
aircraft financings arranged by Barlow.

19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In October 2000, the Company and US Airways amended the US Airways regional jet
service agreement to expand the number of regional jets under contract from 28
to 32 and extend the term to 2008. The Company and US Airways also amended
prorate agreements covering Kansas City, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia, New
Orleans, and Tampa/Orlando. The Kansas City agreement was extended from 2000 to
2005 and amended to eliminate the ability of either party to terminate the
agreement without cause and permit the Company to add additional code share
partners in Kansas City. The other two prorate agreements were extended by one
year over their previous expiration dates.

In November 2000, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with
Midwest Express Airlines, Inc. ("Midwest Express") to add the Midwest Express
code to the Company's operations in Kansas City. The intended start date for the
arrangement is the first quarter of calendar 2001. The agreement will cover 13
cities already served by ten B1900 aircraft out of Kansas City. Mesa anticipates
an improvement in profitability for the routes covered by these aircraft.

In December 2000, the Company reached agreement with Fleet Capital for a $35
million line of credit, collateralized by the company's inventory and
receivables. The agreement, which expires in December 2003, has provisions which
allow the expansion of available credit to $50 million by adding new lenders.
The facility will be used by the Company for general working capital purposes.

(2) Messrs. Lotz, Ferveda, Kostel and Merrett were each granted options under
    the Company's 1st Amendment to the Restated & Amended Mesa Airline Stock
    Option Plan. The shares issued under the Mesa Airline Stock Option Plan vest

(3) Potential realizable values shown above represent the potential gains based
    upon annual compound stock price appreciation of 5% and 10% from September
    30, 2000 through the full option term. The actual value realized, if any, on
    stock option exercises will be dependent upon overall market conditions and

    that the actual value realized will approximate the amounts reflected in
    this table.

(1) Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on September 30,

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

Each non-employee director receives a retainer of $10,000 per year.
Additionally, board members receive $1,000 per Board of Directors meeting
attended in person, $500 per committee meeting attended in person, $500 per
Board of Directors meeting attended via telephone and reimbursement of all
expenses associated with attending committee or Board of Directors meetings.


                                       47
<PAGE>   48
Each non-employee director also participates in the Company's Outside Director's
Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"). Under the Plan, each non-employee director
serving on the board as of April 1, 1998 received (i) 3,000 options to purchase
3,000 shares of Common Stock, plus (ii) the number of options to purchase common
stock equivalent to a cash value of $13,000 as calculated pursuant to the
Black-Scholes valuation method at a risk-free rate of a ten year zero coupon
bond (collectively referred to herein as the "Formula Amount") effective as of
April 1, 1998. Each non-employee director receives an additional Formula Amount
on each April 1st thereafter or, if at any time there is an insufficient number
of options to make the full Formula Amount allocation, a pro-rata amount of the
options available under the Plan shall be granted to each non-employee director.

Any non-employee director who was not serving as a director as of April 1, 1998,
upon the first business day after being appointed as a director, is granted a
pro-rata portion of the Formula Amount ("Pro Rata Options") and options are
granted to such director pursuant to the Plan on each succeeding April 1st in
the Formula Amount. The amount of Pro Rata Options granted to each new
non-employee director are calculated by dividing the number of days prior to
April 1st by the number of days in the calendar year and multiplying the
quotient by the Formula Amount. Any non-employee director who is serving as
Chairman of the Board of Directors receives an annual grant of the number of
options equal to a value of $10,000 calculated in accordance with the
Black-Scholes method as specified above (the "Chairman's Options") on each April
1st, which is in addition to any other options granted to him as director.

Each director who is not an employee of the Company also receives free travel on
flights operated by the Company for himself and certain family members and,
through arrangements with certain major air carriers, receives free or
reduced-fare travel on those carriers at no cost to the Company. The Company
believes that the directors' use of free air travel is "de minimis" and
therefore did not maintain any records of their travel during fiscal 2000.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

The Chief Executive Officer; Chief Financial Officer; President and Chief
Operating Officer; Vice President of Planning, and Vice President and General
Counsel have each entered into an Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") with
the Company.

On May 1, 1998, Jonathan G. Ornstein and the Company entered into an Agreement
for a term of three years ending March 13, 2001, subject to automatic renewal
unless either party gives written notice of its intent to terminate. The
Agreement was amended on March 22, 2000. Under the Agreement, as amended, Mr.
Ornstein receives a combination of a minimum base salary of $200,000 per year
plus a bonus based on positive growth in earnings per share. Specifically, Mr.
Ornstein's Agreement provides for a "Minimum Bonus" of $52,500 if the Company
achieves any positive growth in earnings per share, a "Threshold Bonus" of
$105,000 for growth between 7% and 12.9%, a "Target Bonus" of $210,000 for
growth between 13% and 17.9% and a "Maximum Bonus" of $420,000 for growth of 18%
or better. Additionally, the board of directors may approve discretionary
bonuses.

Further, Mr. Ornstein's Agreement provides for an initial grant of 1,000,000
stock options vesting in one-third increments commencing on the date of grant
and the remainder over a two-year period, and additional annual option grants of
150,000 shares throughout the term of the Agreement, subject to shareholder
approval. If the shareholders do not approve such grants, Mr. Ornstein's
employment agreement requires the Company to issue stock appreciation rights in
an amount necessary to provide the same level of compensation as would have been
provided by the grant of stock options. The Agreement provides that upon
permanent disability, as defined therein, Mr. Ornstein will receive his base
salary plus an amount equal to the Minimum Bonus plus any monthly payments under
any policy of disability income insurance paid for by the Company. The Company
will pay such permanent disability payments for the remaining term of the
Agreement, but in no case will the period exceed 24 months.

Mr. Ornstein may terminate the Agreement at any time, upon written notice,
within one year following the occurrence of an event constituting "Good Reason."
"Good Reason" is defined to mean the occurrence of the following circumstances
without Mr. Ornstein's consent: (i) assignment to any duties substantially
inconsistent with the duties or a reduction in the duties contemplated by the
Agreement; (ii) removal of any titles bestowed under the Agreement; (iii) the
Company's failure to include Mr. Ornstein as a nominee for the Board in its
proxy or his failure to be reelected to the Board; (iv) any breach or failure of
the Company to carry out the provisions of the Agreement after notice and an
opportunity to cure; (v) a Change in Control (as defined below); or (vi)
relocation of Mr. Ornstein, his office, facilities or personnel except if such
relocation is


                                       48
<PAGE>   49
to any future location of the Company's headquarters and such new location is in
a metropolitan area with a population of over 1,000,000 people.

A Change in Control is defined to include (i) a change in control reportable on
Form 8-K or Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii) the
acquisition, other than by an employee benefit plan, of twenty-five percent
(25%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding
securities; (iii) failure of the Incumbent Directors (as defined in the
Agreement) to constitute at least a majority of all directors of the Company;
(iv) the closing of a sale of all or substantially all the assets of the
Company; (v) the Company's adoption of a plan of dissolution or liquidation; or
(vi) the shareholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation involving
the Company (A) in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or (B) if,
immediately following such merger or consolidation, less than seventy-five
percent (75%) of the surviving corporation's outstanding voting stock is held or
anticipated to be held by persons who are stockholders of Company immediately
prior to such merger or consolidation. Upon the termination by the Company
without Good Cause (as defined) or termination by Mr. Ornstein for Good Reason
(as defined), Mr. Ornstein will be entitled to a lump-sum severance payment
equal to the sum of (1) the number of years (or fractions thereof) remaining in
the then non-expired term or two, whichever is greater, multiplied by (a) Mr.
Ornstein's base salary times the number of years, plus (b) the amount of cash
equal to the Target Bonus or the minimum amount of any similar bonus then in
effect, plus (c) any other cash or other bonus earned prior to the date of
termination; and (2) any additional payments necessary to discharge certain tax
liabilities as defined in the Agreement.

Upon Mr. Ornstein's termination without Good Cause or upon Good Reason, any and
all vesting or performance requirements affecting outstanding stock and other
compensation under the Employee Stock Option Plan will be deemed fully satisfied
and any risk of forfeiture with respect thereto will be deemed to have lapsed.
In addition, and notwithstanding the terms of any stock option, stock incentive
or similar plan maintained by the Company or any other agreement between the
Company and Mr. Ornstein (including, without limitation, any stock option
agreement), upon termination of the Executive's employment Without Good Cause or
upon the exercise by Mr. Ornstein of his rights to terminate his employment for
Good Reason (including without limitation upon or following a Change in
Control), the Company shall make a lump sum cash payment to Mr. Ornstein as
follows:

         (i) If Mr. Ornstein's employment is terminated by the Company Without
Good Cause or by Mr. Ornstein for Good Reason, in each case, upon or following a
Change in Control transaction in which the holders of the Company's common stock
receive consideration for their shares (either in the form of cash or
securities, property or a combination thereof), the cash payment shall be made
on the closing date of the transaction constituting the Change in Control and
shall equal the greater of (A) the aggregate Black Scholes value (as calculated
by an independent major investment banking firm) as of such closing date of all
options held by Mr. Ornstein to acquire shares of the common stock of the
Company ("Company Options") and (B) the product of (i) the per share
consideration (the value of which shall be determined by agreement between the
Company and Mr. Ornstein) to be paid to a holder of a share of the Company's
common stock minus the exercise price per share of each Company option held by
Mr. Ornstein and (ii) the number of shares of common stock of the Company
covered by each unexercised Company Option held by Mr. Ornstein; provided,
however, that the total aggregate cash payment to be made to Mr. Ornstein

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial
ownership of the Company's common stock as of September 30, 2000 by (i) each
director of the Company, (ii) each of the Company's executive officers (the
"Named Executive Officers"), (iii), each person who is known by the Company to
be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Company's outstanding
common stock and (iv) all directors and executive officers as a group.

The number of shares beneficially owned by each director or executive officer is
determined under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission"), and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial
ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes
any shares as to which the individual has the sole or shared voting power or
investment power and also any shares which the individual has the right to
acquire within 60 days of December 15, 2000 through the exercise of any stock
option or other right. Unless otherwise indicated, each person has sole
investment and voting power (or shares such powers with his or her spouse) with
respect to the shares set forth in the following table and the address of the
listed beneficial owner is that of the Company. In certain instances, the number
of shares listed includes, in addition to shares owned directly, shares held by
the spouse or children of the person, or by a trust or estate of which the
person is a trustee or an executor or in which the person may have a beneficial
interest. The table that follows is based upon information supplied by executive
officers, directors and principal stockholders and Schedules 13D and 13G filed
with the Commission.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

In August 1998, CCAIR entered into a letter agreement with Barlow Partners, L.P.
("Barlow") pursuant to which Barlow agreed to act as CCAIR's exclusive financial
advisor with respect to possible business combinations involving CCAIR. Under
the terms of that agreement, Barlow received a fee from CCAIR equal to two
percent (2%) of the aggregate consideration paid by Mesa upon the closing in
June 1999 of the merger transaction ($1.1 million). Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Mesa, and James E. Swigart, member
of the Board of Directors of Mesa, are partners in Barlow. George Murnane III,
member of the CCAIR Board of Directors at the time of the merger, is also a
partner in Barlow. Upon the completion of the merger, Mr. Murnane became a
member of the Mesa Board of Directors.

On September 9, 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with International
Airline Support Group ("IASG") whereby Mesa would consign certain surplus
airplane parts to IASG to sell on the open market. IASG in turn would submit
proceeds to Mesa less a market-based fee. During fiscal 2000, the Company paid
IASG approximately $611,000 in commissions on sales of surplus aircraft parts.
Additionally, the Company has leased an aircraft auxiliary power unit from IASG
at a normal commercial monthly rate of $10,000 or $120,000 per year. In fiscal
1999, the Company paid IASG approximately $700,000 in commissions for selling
surplus Westair inventory as well as $250,000 in fees in connection with the
shut down of Westair and distribution and protection of certain of its assets.
Mr. Murnane, a member of the Board of Directors of Mesa, is a member of
executive management and the Board of Directors of IASG.

In February 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with Barlow Partners, LP
("Barlow") whereby Barlow agreed to provide financial advisory services related
to aircraft leases, mergers and acquisitions, and route profitability. Fees
totaling $105,000 and $120,000 were paid to Barlow in fiscal 1999 and 2000,
respectively. Under terms of the Barlow agreement, Barlow is required to repay
these fees to the Company at such time as Barlow receives fees, if any, from
leasing companies that it has arranged to participate in the Company's various
aircraft financings. In fiscal 2000, Barlow repaid the Company the aggregate of
$225,000 in connection with aircraft financings arranged by Barlow.

In December 1999, the Company retained Providence Capital, Inc. to assist with
its stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2000, fees and/or commissions
totaling approximately $136,000 were paid to Providence Capital, Inc. Herbert
Denton, a member of the Company's Board of Directors, is the President and Chief
Executive Officer of Providence Capital, Inc.

The Company provides administrative support, reservation services and office
space to Europe by Air, Inc. During fiscal 2000, the Company billed Europe by
Air approximately $78,000 for these services. Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and James Swigart, a member of
the Company's Board of Directors, are Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive
Officer of Europe by Air, respectively.

third parties.

10-K to the Securities and Exchange Commission and have issued our report
thereon dated December 22, 2000, which expresses an unqualified opinion and
includes an explanatory paragraph concerning the company's change from the
accrual method to the direct expense method for maintenance costs. Note 2 to
such financial statements contains a description of your adoption during the
year ended September 30, 2000 of the change from the accrual method to the
direct expense method for certain maintenance costs. In our judgment, such
change is to an alternative accounting principle that is preferable under the
circumstances.

Yours truly,

DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP
