<P>PART I</P>

<P>Item 1.  Business</P>
</B>
<B><P>General</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vanguard Airlines, Inc. ("Vanguard" or the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 1994.  The Company's principal offices are located at 533 Mexico City Avenue, Kansas City International Airport, Kansas City, Missouri 64153, and its telephone number is (816) 243-2100.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vanguard is a value-priced airline offering scheduled jet service from a hub in Kansas City, Missouri.  As of March 1, 2002 the Company operates six leased Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft and seven leased MD-80 Series ("MD-80") jet aircraft.  The Company operates approximately 58 daily flights to or from its hub in Kansas City, Missouri, serving Atlanta, Austin, Buffalo/Niagara Falls, Chicago-Midway, Colorado Springs, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Pittsburgh and San Francisco.  Flights to Myrtle Beach and Orlando are scheduled to commence on March 28, 2002 and April 22, 2002 respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2000, the Company changed its service strategy from a strategy of providing frequent service in short-to-medium haul markets to a strategy of providing connecting service in national markets over a Kansas City hub.  The Company discontinued most service that did not connect to its hub in Kansas City, including service between Chicago-Midway and each of Denver, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Buffalo/Niagara Falls and Cincinnati.  The Company added service from Kansas City to each of New Orleans, Los Angeles, New York - LaGuardia, Austin (Texas).  In 2001, the Company added service between Kansas City and each of San Francisco, Las Vegas, Fort Lauderdale and Colorado Springs.  Also in 2001, the Company began offering a higher level of customer service, including the addition to its fleet of newer MD-80 aircraft offering a SkyBox &trade; business class cabin, and adoption of the Sabre &trade; global distribution system offering full travel agency access to Vanguard flights.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tragic events of September 11, 2001, seriously impacted the airline industry.  See &quot;Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations&quot; and &quot;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&quot;.  Although the Company's results have been impacted by these events and the general recession, management believes the Company's new strategy has resulted in a marked improvement in the Company's financial prospects and performance, dependent on the Company overcoming these events and the financial crisis they have precipitated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P>The Company's Value-Priced Service</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company typically offers its airline services at fares that are substantially lower than fares offered prior to its entry by major airlines, especially with respect to reservations made within seven days of departure.  The Company's fares are typically matched by the major airlines, especially with respect to reservations made more than seven days prior to departure.  The Company intends to continue its value-priced strategy, although the Company has taken and continues to take actions designed to achieve a modest increase in its fare levels while continuing to offer fares substantially below the levels typically charged on less competitive routes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's value-priced service is intended to appeal to price-sensitive customers, while the Company strives to provide a level of service greater than that typically provided by other &quot;low-fare&quot; airlines.  The Company offers advance seat assignments, more legroom than industry average, and, on a majority of its flights, a business class cabin (SkyBox &trade;) but does not offer meals, in-flight movies, or airline terminal clubs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the Company's fares are sold on a nonrefundable basis and do not require a minimum or a Saturday night stay.  Customers who change their itinerary on a nonrefundable ticket may apply the funds toward the purchase of another Vanguard flight for use within one year of original ticket purchase date, subject to a service charge.  The Company's full coach fares and SkyBox &trade; business class are sold on a refundable basis.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company utilizes a revenue management approach that monitors its fares and inventory in each of its markets and manages the number of seats offered at each of its fares to maximize revenue and passenger loads.  The Company allocates fares through an inventory system that considers the number of available seats in relation to anticipated demand and, commencing in 2001, does not apply artificial advance purchase restriction.  In early 2002, the Company is implementing a highly-automated revenue management system intended to maximize the Company's revenues through close monitoring of booking levels to reduce unnecessary deep-discounting of Company fares. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company also offers low fares each week for last minute travel available only on its internet web site.  These fares are available to Vanguard customers via a proprietary subscription based service called &quot;Hot Deals.&quot;&trade;  Hot Deals allows the Company to sell excess inventory with minimal dilution to its retail pricing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2001, the Company reintroduced corporate travel programs and obtained interline travel agreements with a number of other airlines.  Also in 2001, the Company introduced SkyBid&trade;, an online auction tool allowing customers to bid their own price for Company tickets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reservation Systems</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From 1997 to 2001, the Company used the Open Skies ticketless reservation system, which integrated reservation, marketing and revenue accounting functions.  In April 2001, the Company transitioned to the Sabre&trade; global distribution system, which has facilitated the Company's sales of tickets through ticket agencies while allowing the Company to continue a ticketless operation for many sales.  The Company pays travel agencies a 5% commission, without any commission cap or limit.  Since 1999, the Company has sold tickets over the internet through its proprietary website www.flyvanguard.com.  For the last six months of 2001, most of the Company's ticket sales were made on a ticketless basis, and approximately 30% were made through the Company's proprietary website.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to 2001, the Company did not participate in the Airline Reporting Corporation (&quot;ARC&quot;) industry collection system for travel agency sales and, accordingly, required travel agents to utilize a credit card to guarantee the completion of the sale.  In connection with the Company's transition to the Sabre system, the Company has become a participant in the ARC system.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Marketing and Promotion</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company advertises directly to potential customers using primarily newspapers, radio and direct email advertising, and by engaging in promotional events intended to provide favorable publicity to the Company.  During 2001, the Company increased its marketing to business travelers, through corporate travel programs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company discontinued its old frequent flyer program, VantagePoints, in early 2001, and intends to introduce its new frequent flyer program in 2002.  The details of such program have not been determined.</P>

<B><P>Employees </P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of March 1, 2002, the Company employed 797 full-time employees and 152 part-time or temporary employees, including 136 pilots, 196 flight attendants, 42 mechanics, 284 ground service personnel, 133 reservations personnel and 155 employees in its headquarters staff.  Management believes that its base wage and benefit levels are generally at rates for comparable airlines.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On March 9, 1999, the National Mediation Board (&quot;NMB&quot;) recognized the Vanguard Airlines Pilots Association ("VAPA") as the bargaining unit for the Company's pilots.  Effective June 1, 2000, the Company entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with VAPA that continued the Company's pilot compensation structure with changes that, in the aggregate, have not materially impacted the Company's costs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On February 19, 2002, the Company received notice from the NMB that certain of the Company's flight attendants had returned cards asking the NMB to hold an election to determine whether the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (&quot;IAM&quot;) should be certified as the collective bargaining representative of the Company's flight attendants.  An election is being held with votes counted on May 6, 2002.  The Company cannot predict its outcome.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is unable to predict whether other employee groups will choose to be represented by a collective bargaining representative, or the effect of such representation on the Company's operations or financial results.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company contracts for ground services at many of the airports it serves and outsources its major maintenance requirements, including engine overhauls and heavy airframe checks.  Ground handling services typically involve (i) passenger handling and (ii) underwing aircraft handling services.  Passenger handling at the Company's airports are generally conducted by the Company's employees.  At stations other than Kansas City and Chicago Midway, underwing ground handling services are generally provided by other airlines and/or service companies.</P>

<B><P>Airport Operations</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company leases gate space from airport authorities at certain airports and has sublease or handling arrangements with airlines at other airports.  Most of such arrangements can be terminated by the other airlines or the Company upon short notice.  If such a termination were to occur, the Company would have to make alternative arrangements or cease operations at the affected airport.  There can be no assurance that alternative arrangements would be available at all or at a reasonable cost.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>At four airports, Chicago-O'Hare, New York City-LaGuardia, New York City-JFK and Washington, D.C.-Reagan National, flight operations are regulated by means of &quot;slot&quot; allocations, which represent governmental authorizations to take off or land within a specified time period.  Regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation (&quot;DOT&quot;) currently permit the buying, selling, trading or leasing of slots.  The Company has sought, but has been unable to obtain, slots to serve Reagan National.  Legislation has been introduced in Congress to increase the availability of slots and gates to new entrant airlines such as the Company.  The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will become law, or whether such law will in actuality allow the Company to obtain its own gates or slots at restricted airports.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aircraft</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of March 1, 2002, the Company's aircraft fleet consists of eight leased Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft and seven leased MD-80 series aircraft. Of such leased aircraft, two 737-200 aircraft were not being used in operations but were being prepared for return to the respective lessors under negotiated early lease termination agreements. Two additional 737-200 aircraft are being returned to their respective lessor in March at the lessor's request following failure to resolve, in a manner satisfactory to the Company and such lessor, rent deferral terms.  (For a discussion of lease defaults and rent deferrals, see &quot;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&quot;)  The Company intends to transition all its flying to MD-80 series aircraft as soon as practical in order to achieve the cost advantages of operating a single fleet type.  To that end, the Company has approached the lessors of its remaining Boeing 737-200 aircraft regarding the possible 
return of these aircraft prior to the expiration date of their leases. The Company is negotiating early return agreements but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain agreements with satisfactory terms.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company added MD-80 series aircraft to its fleet in order to improve reliability and customer service, as well as to serve longer-haul flights, such as Kansas City - San Francisco, that are difficult to serve with 737-200 aircraft. As would be expected to be the case with the addition of any new aircraft, the reliability of the Company's MD-80 fleet was lower than desired in 2001 due to the need to familiarize the Company's personnel with MD-80 aircraft.  The reliability of the MD-80 aircraft also has been hampered by the low level of spare parts currently maintained by the Company, which results in the Company needing to obtain parts from third party suppliers as each need arises.  The Company expects to increase its level of spare parts when its financial condition improves.</P>
<B>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In July 2001, the Company entered an agreement providing Pegasus Aviation status as a preferred supplier of aircraft leased or purchased by the Company, including certain rights of first refusal in the event the Company seeks to lease additional aircraft.  The Company has commitments to lease an additional three MD-80 series aircraft from Pegasus Aviation for a term of six years each, which are expected to be delivered in 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the market for used aircraft has softened substantially, with the result that aircraft are currently available at lease rates significantly lower than lease rates prevailing a year ago.  The Company has had discussions with regard to the lease of additional aircraft, including aircraft of similar type to the MD-80 series aircraft, and intends to continue to explore all aircraft lease alternatives available to it.</P>

<P>&#9;See &quot;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&quot;</P>
<B>
<P>Maintenance and Repairs</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general, all expenses relating to the maintenance and operation of the Company's leased aircraft are the Company's responsibility.  While the Company anticipates a higher maintenance cost for older aircraft, including costs to comply with Airworthiness Directives (&quot;ADs&quot;) issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (&quot;FAA&quot;) and regulations for aging aircraft, the Company believes that the total costs of operating the MD-80 and Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft is competitive with newer aircraft types because the Company's aircraft have significantly lower acquisition or lease costs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;All maintenance and repairs are performed in accordance with the Company's FAA-approved maintenance program.  Routine or daily maintenance is generally performed by the Company's mechanics in Kansas City or in various other cities, as needed, by the Company's mechanics or independent contractors.  The Company has contracted with COOPESA in Costa Rica and Bedek/IAI in Israel and other FAA-certified maintenance providers to perform its major overhauls and engine and component repairs.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any interruption of aircraft service as a result of scheduled or unscheduled maintenance could materially and adversely affect the Company's operational and financial performance.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fuel</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of jet fuel is one of the Company's largest operating expenses, constituting approximately 20% of operating expenses, including taxes and into-plane service fees, for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Fuel cost an average of $0.91 per gallon in 2001 compared to $1.05 in 2000 and $0.67 in 1999. As of March 1, 2002, the Company's average fuel price is approximately $0.70 per gallon.  The Company cannot predict the future availability or cost of jet fuel.  Any unavailability of fuel or increase in the price of fuel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations or financial condition.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's MD-80 and 737-200 jet aircraft are not as fuel efficient as newer model aircraft.  Accordingly, a significant increase in the price of jet fuel may result in a disproportionately higher increase in the Company's fuel expenses as compared with certain of its competitors, although many competitors also operate older model aircraft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has not entered into any agreements that fix or "hedge" the price of jet fuel.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Competition</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subject to an airline obtaining gates and slots (where required), domestic airlines are generally free to enter and exit domestic routes and to set fares without regulatory approval.  As a consequence, the airline industry is intensely competitive and susceptible to price discounting.  Airlines compete primarily with respect to fares, scheduling (frequency and flight time), destinations, frequent-flyer programs and type and size of aircraft.  The Company competes with numerous other airlines on its routes and expects to compete with other airlines on any future routes.  Most of the Company's competitors are larger and have greater name recognition and greater financial resources than the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the Company's commencement of service in a particular market, competing airlines have, at times, added flights and capacity in the market and lowered their fares, making it more difficult for the Company to achieve or maintain profitable operations.  In the future, other airlines may set their prices at or below the Company's fares, introduce new non-stop service or add additional capacity in an attempt to prevent the Company from achieving or continuing profitable operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation has from time to time been introduced in Congress and rules have been proposed (and withdrawn) by the DOT to curtail incidences of unfair competition in the airline industry.  In addition, the Department of Justice (&quot;DOJ&quot;) has brought an antitrust action against American Airlines alleging predatory conduct and unfair competition by American Airlines against Vanguard and other airlines, and the DOJ is currently appealing a decision dismissing the case.  Although awareness of the problem of unfair competition appears to be at a high level, management cannot predict whether any meaningful relief will be obtained to preclude incidences of unfair competition in the airline industry.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government Regulation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The airline business is highly regulated.  Regulations promulgated by the FAA affect all aspects of flight operations, aircraft maintenance, aircraft ground operations, security, and employee training.  The DOT's jurisdiction extends primarily to the economic aspects of air transportation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vanguard began flight operations in December 1994.  Since then, Vanguard has had no reportable incidents that have involved serious bodily injury or significant damage to any of the Company's aircraft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, additional security procedures have been required that have both increased the cost of security screening and required passengers to allow extra time for boarding their flights.  Such procedures include the prohibition of many items from being carried on board, random screening of selected passengers and their baggage and positive bag match to prevent checked luggage from being transported if the passenger does not board a flight.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In February 2002, the federal government assumed responsibility for security screening of passengers at airports.  Previously, such functions generally had been performed by third party providers under contract to the Company or other airlines.  Effective February 1, 2002, airlines are required to collect from passengers a government-mandated fee (up to $10 per roundtrip ticket) to reimburse the government for such service.  The government has also assessed Vanguard (and other airlines) a fee for security services, capped through 2004 at Vanguard's actual security costs for calendar year 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Effective December 31, 2002, all checked baggage must be screened by explosive detection systems, which will require significant expenditures by the government and airports -- which may pass such costs on to the airlines - and may require changes in the procedures for accepting checked baggage.  Additional procedures to improve security and/or facilitate the security screening process have been considered; other than as described herein, the Company cannot predict whether further changes will be implemented.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's flight personnel, flight and emergency procedures and aircraft and maintenance facilities are subject to periodic inspections and tests by the FAA.  FAA examiners have flown on numerous Company flights and have subjected its flight and ground personnel to periodic announced and unannounced reviews and inspections.  In accordance with FAA standard procedures, the FAA has maintained a heightened degree of scrutiny of Vanguard's operations due to Vanguard's financial condition.  The Company believes that its operations, maintenance and compliance with FAA regulations are within industry standards.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DOT and FAA have authority under the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979, under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (&quot;ANCA&quot;) and, along with the Environmental Protection Agency, under the Clean Air Act, to monitor and regulate aircraft engine noise and exhaust emissions.  The Company's aircraft comply with Federal Stage III noise level requirements and emissions standards.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Insurance</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company carries the types and amounts of insurance customary for airlines similar to the Company, including coverage for public liability, property damage, aircraft loss or damage, baggage and cargo liability and workers' compensation.  While the Company believes such insurance will be adequate as to amounts and risks covered, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available or that it will fully protect the Company against all losses that it might sustain.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Immediately following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, most or all airline insurers cancelled their war risk policies (which were, in general, cancelable on seven days notice) and renewed such coverage with lower limits and at substantially increased premiums.  Currently, the Company purchases excess war risk insurance from the United States Government under a program available to all U.S. airlines.  This coverage is currently scheduled to expire on May 19, 2002.  While similar previous expiration dates have been extended, there can be no assurance that this program will be continued.  Should this program be discontinued, the Company would be required to obtain replacement coverage in the private market.  At this time, all private market options available are considerably more expensive than the current coverage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company renewed its comprehensive airline liability policy on November 1, 2001.  For the 2001-2002 policy year, the Company's insurance premiums increased 170%, or approximately $4.4 million on an annual basis. As in prior years, the Company's policies (as is standard in the industry) are cancelable on short notice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vanguard's business operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may affect future operations and financial results, including:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">History of Significant Operating Losses.</B></I>  From the Company's inception on April 25, 1994 through 1997 and since 1998, the Company has incurred significant losses from operations.  As of December 31, 2001, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $133 million and a working capital deficit of $45 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Availability of Working Capital.</B></I>  Historically, the Company's continued operations have been dependent upon equity and debt financings.  The tragic events of September 11, 2001 have substantially restricted the Company's access to the private capital markets.  The Company has sought a federal loan guarantee under a program adopted by Congress following the September 11 tragedy.  There can be no assurance that such loan guarantee will be available or that the Company will be able to obtain additional working capital.  An inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations and could require the Company to cease or significantly curtail operations.</P>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.</B></I>  The reports issued by the Company's independent auditors for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, each contain an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The report states that because of the Company's net losses, working capital deficit, and net capital deficiency, the Company has been dependent upon financing from principal stockholders and the forbearance of its aircraft lessors.  The report further states that there can be no assurance as to the availability of further financing or continued creditor forbearance.  At least one creditor has threatened the institution of involuntary chapter 11 proceedings against the Company, although the Company believes such action would, in fact, be detrimental to the interests of creditors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Small Size.</B></I>  As of March 1, 2002, the Company operates approximately 60 flights per day to and from Kansas City.  As a hub airline, the Company depends on connecting passengers for a portion of its revenues.  As the Company increases the flights (both frequency and number of destinations) it offers more connecting and scheduling alternatives and can market its existing flights to more potential customers.  Accordingly, management believes that the Company must grow to a certain minimum size (critical mass) before sustained profitability can be achieved.  Management intends to grow the Company to achieve larger size.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lease Deferrals and Defaults.</B></I>  The Company is in arrears in payments on many of its aircraft leases and certain airport leases and has received notices of default with regard to certain of such leases.  The Company has been negotiating deferral terms and restructuring terms with its lessors, but there can be no assurance that the Company's lessors and creditors will continue to work with the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Competition and Competitive Reaction.  </B></I>The Company is subject to intense competition on all of its routes.  Most of the Company's competitors are larger and have greater name recognition and financial resources than the Company.  In response to the Company's commencement of service in a particular market, competing airlines have, at times, added flights and capacity and lowered their fares in the market, making it more difficult for the Company to achieve profitable operations in such markets.  Although management believes such actions may constitute predatory or unfair methods of competition, management believes the available methods of protesting such conduct are either too costly or largely ineffective.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fuel Costs.</B>  </I>The cost of jet fuel is one of the largest operating expenses for an airline.  Jet fuel costs, including taxes and into-plane servicing fees, accounted for approximately 20% of the Company's operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001.  The cost of jet fuel is highly susceptible to local, national, and international conditions and global events.  The Company cannot predict the future availability and cost of jet fuel.  Any unavailability of fuel or increase in fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and financial results.  The Company has not purchased hedges against fuel price increases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's aircraft are not as efficient as the newest model aircraft.  Accordingly, a significant increase in the price of jet fuel may result in a disproportionately higher increase in the Company's fuel expenses as compared with certain of its competitors, although many of the Company's competitors also operate older model aircraft.  The Company has not entered into any agreements that fix the price of jet fuel over any period of time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Consumer Concern About Operating Safety.</B></I>  Aircraft accidents or other safety-related issues involving any carrier may have an adverse effect on airline passengers' perceptions regarding the safety of smaller, low-fare carriers. As a result, any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, even if such event does not involve the Company's operations or personnel.  Similarly, publicized accounts of mechanical problems or accidents involving Boeing 737s, MD-80s or other aging aircraft could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, even though the Company itself may not experience any such problems with its aircraft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seasonality and Cyclicality</B>.</I>  Airlines typically experience reduced demand at various times during the year and increased demand for service during the summer.  In addition, passenger travel in the airline industry, particularly leisure travel, is sensitive to adverse changes in general economic conditions, although as a low-fare carrier the Company may actually benefit from increased sensitivity of passengers to the cost of air travel.  A worsening of current economic conditions, or an extended period of recession nationally or in the regions served by the Company, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unscheduled Maintenance.</B></I>  Although the Company rotates its fleet through heavy maintenance procedures, the need for unscheduled maintenance can and does arise from time to time for various reasons.  Any significant increase in the frequency of unscheduled maintenance or any interruption of aircraft service as a result of unscheduled maintenance could materially and adversely affect the Company's service, reputation and financial results.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limited Market for Aircraft. </B></I> The market for purchased and/or leased aircraft fluctuates based on worldwide macroeconomic factors.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to purchase or lease additional aircraft on satisfactory terms or at the times needed.  The inability of the Company to lease additional aircraft could have an adverse effect on the Company's growth plan and operating results.  However, as of March 2002, aircraft leasing terms and aircraft availability, particularly with respect to MD-80s, are quite favorable to the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ability to Integrate Second Aircraft Type.</B></I>  Historically, the Company has operated a single aircraft type, the 737-200.  Commencing in the second quarter of 2001, the Company began operating a second aircraft type, the MD-80. The addition of this second aircraft type added complexity in many areas of the Company's operation, including crew scheduling and training, spare parts support and handling of flight delays and cancellations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government Regulation.</B></I>  The FAA has promulgated a number of maintenance regulations and directives relating to, among other things, aircraft and airport security, retirement of aging aircraft, increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on aging aircraft, collision avoidance systems, aircraft corrosion, airborne windshear avoidance systems and noise abatement.  Additional rules and regulations have been proposed from time to time in the last several years.  These or other rules could significantly increase the cost of airline operations by imposing substantial additional requirements or restrictions on airline operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, additional security procedures have been required that have both increased the cost of security screening and required passengers to allow extra time for boarding their flights.  Such procedures include the prohibition of many items from being carried on board, random screening of selected passengers and their baggage and positive bag match to prevent checked luggage from being transported if the passenger does not board a flight.  Additional procedures to improve security and/or facilitate the security screening process have been considered; other than as described herein, the Company cannot predict whether further changes will be implemented or the impact of such changes on its operations.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Implementation of Growth Strategy.</B></FONT>  </I><FONT SIZE=2>Establishing new markets involves a substantial commitment of Company resources.  During the initial phases of implementing service in a new market, the Company is more vulnerable to the effects of fare discounting by competitors.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully establish new markets, or that the Company will be able to obtain facilities or airport services in potential new markets on a timely basis or at commercially reasonable prices, if at all.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limited Trading Volume; Limited Marketability of Common Stock.</B></FONT>  </I><FONT SIZE=2>The Company's common stock has had limited trading volume in the last year, with less than 12,000 shares trading each day, on average.  The Company's Common Stock was delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market on December 10, 2001 and is currently traded over-the-counter, on the OTC Bulletin Board.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limited Number of Routes / Dependence on Kansas City Hub.  </B></I>Because of Vanguard's limited number of routes and single hub operation, the Company is at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger airlines with their more extensive route networks.  The Company could be adversely affected should a major competitor decide to significantly expand or add operations in Kansas City.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Control by Several Shareholders.</B>  </I>Vanguard's principal stockholders are Vanguard Acquisition Company, an affiliate of Pegasus Aviation, a global aircraft leasing company; construction company J. F. Shea Company; and the Hambrecht 1980 Revocable Trust (William R. Hambrecht, trustee).  Together, these entities and their affiliates own or control approximately 82% of Vanguard's outstanding voting securities.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Collateral for Credit Card Exposure.</B>  </I>Nearly all the Company's ticket sales are charged to credit cards.  The bank which processes the Company's credit card receipts requires the Company to provide collateral to secure payments made with respect to tickets sold but not yet flown.  The Company currently has a total of $10 million in available security instruments that may be used to collateralize its exposure with the bank.  To the extent that the credit card exposure (as defined) exceeds $10 million, the bank withholds cash generated by new ticket sales in a restricted account to provide collateral for the amount of the exposure above $10 million.  The $10 million security instruments consist of a $4 million letter of credit (the &quot;LOC&quot;) provided by two of the Company's principal stockholders and a $6 million surety bond (the &quot;Surety Bond&quot;) provided by North American Specialty Insurance Company.  The bank has advised the Company that it will cease processing the 
Company's credit card receivables on March 31, 2002, as a result of the bank ceasing this line of business in general.  The Company has obtained a non-binding agreement in principle from a new bank to assume such functions; however, the new bank has been unwilling to accept a surety bond as collateral. Accordingly, the Company must obtain replacement collateral satisfactory to the new processor or the new processor will withhold funds when its exposure exceeds $4 million.  The Company also must obtain the approval of the old bank and the stockholders providing the letters of credit that such letters of credit may also be used to secure the new bank. There can be no assurance that timely arrangements can be completed that allow the Company continued access to cash from credit card sales.  If such arrangements are not obtained, the Company could be required to cease operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<B><I>Decreased Demand for Air Travel Due to September 11.</B></I>  Immediately following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Company experienced a significant decrease in demand for air travel, as did other airlines.  In addition to reduced levels of traffic, this decrease in demand resulted in industry-wide fare sales as airlines competed for the available demand and attempted to stimulate additional demand.  Although the Company's traffic levels have since increased, any further public sensitivity to air terrorism could reduce the demand for air travel.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increased Costs Due to September 11.</B></I>  As a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the DOT has imposed more stringent and additional measures to ensure the safety and security of commercial aircraft.  Such measures have required the Company (and other airlines) to increase airport staffing levels and have resulted in occasional flight delays, as well as further depressing the demand for air travel.  The U.S. Congress and administration are considering further measures to improve the safety and security of commercial air travel.  Management of the Company cannot predict when or whether further requirements will be imposed, the cost of compliance with such requirements or the extent of further changes in the manner of ensuring airport and airline security.  Such changes could increase the Company's costs or further reduce the demand for air travel.</P>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Insurance Cost and Availability Following September 11.</B></I>  The aviation insurance industry is predicting huge underwriting losses as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks. This has resulted in a substantial increase in insurance premiums and has put in question the availability of some types of coverage, such as war-risk insurance.  The Company is required by the terms of its aircraft leases to maintain a minimum level of insurance.  Were such insurance not available, or were the Company unable to pay the costs of such insurance, the Company would immediately cease operations.  There can be no assurance that comprehensive airline hull and liability insurance and war risk insurance will continue to be available on terms the Company can afford.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">September 11 Security Fee.</B></I>  As enabled by Congress, the FAA imposed the September 11 Security Fee to be collected on all passenger tickets sold after January 31, 2002 by all U.S. airlines.  This fee adds a maximum of $10 of additional cost to each passenger ticket sold by the Company (and other airlines).  The imposition of this additional cost may have a negative impact on passenger demand and the Company's ability to maintain or increase its current fares.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Item 2.  Properties</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company leases approximately 148,000 square feet of office space near Kansas City International Airport (&quot;KCI&quot;) for corporate administration, training, and dispatch under a lease that began in July 2000 and has a minimum term of five years, subject to extension for certain capital improvement events.  The Company leases approximately 9,000 square feet of office space in Mission, Kansas for its reservation center.</P>

<B><P>Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EXCEPT FOR THE HISTORICAL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN, THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BELIEFS.  WHEN USED IN THIS DOCUMENT, THE WORDS &quot;BELIEVE,&quot; &quot;EXPECT,&quot; &quot;INTEND,&quot; "ESTIMATE," "ANTICIPATE," "PROJECT" AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.  THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED.  FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, RISKS RELATED TO AIR TERRORISM, AVAILABILITY OF WORKING CAPITAL, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF JET FUEL, AIRLINE ACCIDENTS OR INCIDENTS, UNSCHEDULED MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, UNAVAILABILITY OF JET AIRCRAFT ON FAVORABLE TERMS, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF AIRLINES OR AIRCRAFT AND AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION
 BY OTHER AIRLINES. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SUCH RISKS, SEE "ITEM 1.  BUSINESS - FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS".</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the Company has, to date, lost general access to the unsecured private capital markets as have a number of airlines.  The Company requires additional debt or equity financing to fund ongoing operations in 2002. The Company is seeking to raise additional capital and is applying for federal loan guarantees authorized by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (&quot;ATSSSA&quot;); however, there can be no assurance that such capital can be obtained.  The inability to secure additional funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including the likelihood that the Company could have to cease operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company filed its original application for a federal loan guarantee with the Air Transportation Stabilization Board (&quot;ATSB&quot;) on December 6, 2001 and has filed several revisions in response to comments from the ATSB.  The ATSB has questioned the Company's eligibility for a loan, in part on account of the Company's relatively small scope of operations.  The Company is aggressively countering such concerns by providing the ATSB with data demonstrating the importance to a competitive national transportation system of low fare airlines like Vanguard, as well as Vanguard's projected ability to repay the loan based on its current business plan.  Although there can be no promises as to future results, management believes the Company has a viable business plan that can lead to sustained profitability, as demonstrated by the Company's recent results as compared to general industry results.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company is also seeking to restructure its existing vendor payables, aircraft lease obligations, and equity interests, including in connection with the receipt of new financing either with, or without, the federal loan guarantees.  The Company intends to reduce its existing payables by an amount that has not been finally determined and to restructure its aircraft lease obligations to reflect fair market lease values.  The Company's Board of Directors has approved a one-for-five reverse stock split which would reduce the number of shares of Vanguard common stock outstanding or reserved for issuance, thereby creating a larger pool of unissued and unreserved shares available for issuance to a new investor in connection with the contemplated financings.  The issuance of common stock or common stock purchase rights in connection with such restructuring or financings may substantially dilute the interests of existing stockholders.  There can be no assurance that such restructuring can be
 accomplished.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development of Vanguard's Business</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company was incorporated on April 25, 1994 and currently operates a value-priced, medium-to-long haul passenger airline with a hub in Kansas City, Missouri.  The Company's operating revenues are derived principally from the sale of airline services to passengers and are recognized when transportation is provided.  Total operating revenues are primarily a function of capacity, fare levels and the number of seats sold per flight.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In 2000, following an unsuccessful effort to build a viable hub at Chicago's Midway Airport, management undertook a comprehensive review of the Company's strategic alternatives.  As a result of this review, the Company determined to refocus its route strategy on operating medium-to-long haul routes that connect through a hub in Kansas City.  Management believes the Company can profitably operate a hub at Kansas City for several reasons, the most significant of which are (i) the Company's cost structure is less than the cost structure of most airlines providing medium-to-long-haul service, (ii) Kansas City is a strong business market that is not dominated by a single airline, and (iii) the Company's load factors and route-specific yields have improved significantly over the course of 2001 (after taking into account the impact of September 11), validating the business strategy.  There can, however, be no assurance of the Company's future success.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among other route changes, during 2000 and early 2001, the Company discontinued most of its short-haul flying from Chicago Midway and transitioned to a Kansas City hub operation serving medium to long-haul markets, including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Las Vegas.  Also in 2001, the Company also began offering a higher level of customer service, including the addition to its fleet of newer MD-80 aircraft offering a SkyBox &trade; business class cabin, and adoption of the Sabre &trade; global distribution system offering full travel agency access to Vanguard flights.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During 2001, the Company introduced MD-80 aircraft into its fleet, which increased costs for crew training and provisioning of related equipment.  As of March 1, 2002, the Company leases eight Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft and seven MD-80 jet aircraft.  Two of the Company's 737-200 aircraft were not being used in operations but were being prepared for return to their lessors under negotiated early lease termination agreements. Two additional 737-200 aircraft are being returned to their respective lessor in March at the lessor's request following failure to resolve, in a manner satisfactory to the Company and such lessor, rent deferral terms.  The Company is committed to lease three additional used MD-80 series jet aircraft with deliveries in 2002.  The Company intends to lease additional MD-80 series jet aircraft and retire its remaining 737-200 aircraft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The lease costs on the MD-80 series aircraft are higher than the lease costs on the Company's 737-200 aircraft, but, following September 11, the lease rates on used aircraft have declined significantly (30% or more) compared to prior levels.  The MD-80 series aircraft are generally newer aircraft and are expected to have greater reliability and lower annual maintenance expense.  In addition, in the Company's configuration, most of the MD-80 series aircraft seat 10% more passengers and include a business class cabin.  The Company continues to analyze its fleet requirements in the context of available aircraft lease terms and broader market conditions and may determine to add an additional aircraft type and/or hasten the elimination of its 737-200 aircraft.  Management believes that the Company's aircraft fleet plan should be implemented considering all relevant factors, including the ancillary support available from aircraft lessors in the form of spare parts provisioning, maintenance s
ervice, or general financial assistance. Management intends to  seek to renegotiate the terms of its aircraft leases as part of the restructuring discussed below.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<FONT SIZE=2>Prior to September 11, 2001, the Company had begun several initiatives designed to increase its average fare levels, including modest fare increases, tighter control over inventory levels at discounted fares, and improved marketing to business travelers, including to travel agencies.  The Company contracted with Sabre Holdings Corporation to provide the Company's computerized reservation and check-in system for a period of five years, and transitioned its reservation system to Sabre&trade; in April 2001.  The Company incurred significant one-time costs in implementing this transition (including for retraining of all reservations and customer service agents), which costs were exacerbated by vendor difficulties arising during the conversion process which resulted in temporary passenger inconvenience and lost sales. By the end of the third quarter of 2001, the Company's reservations operations had returned to normal levels and substantially all the Company's reservations and 
customer service personnel had been trained on Sabre&trade;.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In addition to these one-time transition costs, the transition to the Sabre system and the accompanying changes in other systems have resulted in a material increase in ongoing reservations and booking expense.  Management believes this ongoing expense increase has been more than offset by an increase in sales due, in part, to the Sabre&trade; system providing the Company's flights improved display on travel agency reservation systems. In the fourth quarter of 2001, approximately 59% of the Company's ticket sales were made through GDS (global distribution systems), as compared to 31% in the fourth quarter of 2000.  Since 1999, the Company has also sold tickets on a proprietary website, www.flyvanguard.com.  For the last six months of 2001, approximately 30% of the Company's ticket sales were made through www.flyvanguard.com.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company continues its efforts to increase yields through more aggressive marketing to travel agencies and corporate accounts, and through improved yield management techniques.  In early 2002, the Company is implementing a highly-automated revenue management system intended to maximize the Company's revenues through close monitoring of booking levels to reduce unnecessary deep-discounting of Company fares.  In addition, the Company seeks to improve 2002 yields through the offering of more SkyBox &trade; business class seats, through selection of new routes which generate higher yields, and through maturation of the Sabre&trade; reservation system which expands the Company's sales and distribution reach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of November 1, 2001, the Company renewed its comprehensive airline general liability policy under similar terms and conditions as existed previously but at substantially increased premiums.  Without taking into consideration potential government reimbursement of insurance cost increases, and assuming no changes in the Company's war risk policy (which, as is customary in the industry, is cancelable on short notice) and that certain war risk liability coverage currently provided by the government continues to be available at current rates, the Company's insurance costs will increase approximately 170%, or approximately $4.4 million, in 2001-2002 as compared to 2000-2001. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During 2001, the Company raised capital by selling equity to its principal shareholders and to Vanguard Acquisition Company (&quot;VAC&quot;), an affiliate of Pegasus Aviation.  The sale of equity to VAC is referred to herein as the &quot;VAC Transaction&quot;.   On December 10, 2001, the Company's Common Stock was delisted from the NASDAQ SmallCap market and began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">September 11 and Its Aftermath</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On September 11, 2001, international terrorists hijacked four aircraft (operated by American Airlines and United Airlines) and crashed them into New York City's twin World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon in Washington D.C., resulting in the loss of approximately 3,000 lives.  This act of war resulted in the closure of the U.S. air traffic system for over two days and significantly reduced demand for air travel.  Published reports suggest domestic airline losses resulting from these attacks may exceed $10 billion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In response to the terrorist attacks, the U.S. Congress approved $15 billion in aid to stabilize the airline industry, including (i) up to $5 billion in direct grants to passenger and cargo airlines to cover losses through the end of December 2001 directly and indirectly resulting from the attacks, (ii) up to $10 billion in loan guarantees to facilitate the airline industry's access to the capital markets, (iii) war risk insurance for up to 180 days and (iv) reimbursements to airlines for certain war risk insurance premium increases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The $5 billion of direct grants has been allocated among U. S. airlines based on their relative size, as measured by available seat miles or cargo ton miles flown during August 2001.  The allocation to Vanguard Airlines based on its ASM's was approximately $7.3 million, which has been received and has been recognized as other income in the 2001 financial statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the decreased demand for air transportation after the terrorist attacks, the Company temporarily reduced its scheduled level of flying by approximately 15% and furloughed approximately 150 employees.  As of March 1, 2002, the Company has recalled all furloughed employees and has recommenced growth in its airline operations, operating approximately the same number of flights per day as it did in early September 2001.</P>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financial Results - 2001 Compared to 2000 </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Any comparison of year-to-year results must take into consideration the substantial recent changes in the Company's route structure and business strategy.  Revenues derived from new routes generally build over a period of time.  During 2001, the Company introduced service from Kansas City to Austin, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale and Colorado Springs. Also, certain costs have increased as a result of transition expense and the perceived need to commence new markets with low frequency service.  Revenues and expenses were also impacted in 2001 as a result of the Company's transition to Sabre&trade; as its host reservations system, and the Company's introduction of MD-80 aircraft into its flee.  Transition expenses related to both the switch to Sabre&trade; and the introduction of MD-80 series aircraft include training expense and the cost of acquisition of equipment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Any comparison of year-to-year results must also take into consideration the industry-wide impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 (&quot;YE 2001&quot;), the Company realized a net loss of $30.9 million as compared with a net loss of $26.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 (&quot;YE 2000&quot;).  Operating revenues decreased 10%, or $13.1 million, for YE 2001 compared with YE 2000, while operating expenses decreased 4%, or $6.7 million.  $4.1  million of the Company's net loss in YE 2001 is attributable to the accounting treatment of the VAC Transaction which resulted in a non-cash charge to earnings in the second quarter (as discussed in footnote 4 to the accompanying financial statements) and $4.8 million of the loss is attributable to costs associated with aircraft return.  $3.0 million of the Company's net loss in YE 2001 is attributable to the Company's decision in December 2001 to terminate the leases on two 737-200 aircraft which will be returned to lessors in 2002.  The Company is seeking to negotiate a reduction in such liability.  Results 
for 2001include the positive impact of $7.3 million of federal grant assistance, recorded as non-operating other income although the grant assistance was intended primarily to offset operating revenues lost as a result of September 11.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company's results for YE 2001 reflect a significant increase (46%) in the Company's average length of haul (the average length of a passenger's flight) resulting from the reconfiguration of its route system to longer-haul flying from a Kansas City hub.  The Company's scope of operations (as measured by ASMs) increased 2% between the periods despite a 31% decrease in flight departures, attributable to the transition to longer-haul flying.  The Company's revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 13%, resulting in an increase in load factor of 11%, to an average of 65.8% for YE 2001 compared to a 59.2% load factor for YE 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Operating expense per ASM declined 6% from YE 2000 to YE 2001.  These unit cost improvements were more than offset by a 19% decline in yield for the period, mainly attributable to the longer haul flying and to an increase in discount fares resulting, in part, from the Company's entering new markets, widespread fare discounting in the industry, and general decreases in passenger demand resulting, management believes, from general passenger concerns over a soft economy and the impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Operating Revenues - 2001 Compared to 2000</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Total operating revenues decreased 10% to $118.7 million for YE 2001 from $131.8 million for YE 2000.  An 11% increase in the Company's load factor for YE 2001 was more than offset by a 19% decline in yield for YE 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Fare levels (and yields) were impacted during YE 2001 as a result of the Company's efforts to stimulate traffic in the first half of the year.  The Company's traffic levels had declined significantly in January 2001, in part as a result, management believes, of general uncertainty over the domestic economy, as well as passengers booking away from the Company due to a decline in the Company's operational performance in December 2000.  The Company instituted a fare sale in the first quarter of 2001 to stimulate sales.  The conversion to Sabre in the second quarter disrupted the Company's reservations activity, resulting in lost sales.  The Company's many yield improvement initiatives, including the institution of SkyBox&trade; business class service in 3Q 2001, were effective despite widespread industry fare discounting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A majority of the Company's fares are non-refundable.  When forfeited, these fares are recognized in passenger revenue.  In conjunction with its conversion to Sabre&trade; reservations system in April 2001, the Company revised its fare rules applicable to certain passengers who do not complete their scheduled itinerary.  As a result of this change, the Company generally no longer allows unused non-refundable fares to be applied as a credit against future travel if the change is not requested before the reserved flight date.  In the month in which the &quot;no show&quot; occurs, the Company recognizes revenue for an estimate of unused  non-refundable tickets that will never be presented for exchange. Revenues from expiration of nonrefundable tickets totaled $8.7  million, or 8% of passenger revenue, in YE 2001 compared with $9.4 million, 8% of passenger revenue, for YE 2000. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Other revenues consist of ticket change service fees, charter revenue, liquor sales, and mail and cargo revenues.  Service fees declined to $2.8 million in YE 2001 from $4.8 million for YE 2000, largely due to the Company's change in fare rules to restrict rebooking of nonrefundable fares.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Operating Expenses - 2001 Compared to 2000</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Unit costs on a cents-per-ASM basis decreased 6% for YE 2001 compared with YE 2000.  Unit cost decreases in fuel, maintenance, and promotion and sales expense were partially offset by increases in flying operations, passenger service, general and administrative and aircraft return and lease termination costs.  The cost increases were driven primarily by the changes in the Company's route system to low-frequency service in higher cost markets such as New York-LaGuardia and Los Angeles and costs related to the introduction of the MD-80 aircraft and the transition to Sabre.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Flying operations expense increased 7%, or $2.1 million, in YE 2001 compared with YE 2000.  During YE 2001, aircraft rent increased $0.9 million with the replacement of Boeing 737-200 aircraft by MD-80 aircraft, which have higher lease costs, although the average fleet size decreased 12% for the same period. Increased costs for crew training for the new MD-80 aircraft type were partially offset by a reduction in pilot salaries due to the decrease in block hours.  On a cents-per-ASM basis, flying operations expense increased 5% from 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Fuel costs decreased 20%, or $7.8 million, in YE 2001 compared with YE 2000.  Fuel usage decreased 8% to approximately 33 million gallons for YE 2001, commensurate with an 11% decrease in block hours flown, while average cost per gallon decreased 13% to $0.91 for YE 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Maintenance expenses include all maintenance-related labor, parts, supplies and other expenses related to the upkeep of aircraft.  The Company accrues expense for engine overhauls and heavy airframe maintenance based on aircraft usage and expenses other minor and unscheduled maintenance as incurred.  Maintenance expenses decreased 27%, or $8.1 million, for YE 2001 compared with YE 2000.  Maintenance expenses decreased principally due to an 11% reduction in the block hours flown in YE 2001 compared to YE 2000 and greater efficiencies and cost control built into the Company's maintenance activities.  Additionally, in YE 2001 the Company determined that certain scheduled major maintenance events on a portion of the Company's Boeing 737-200 aircraft would not have to be performed during the term of the related lease as originally assumed which resulted in a $2.7 million reduction in maintenance expense in YE 2001.  Maintenance expenses decreased on a cents per ASM basis to 1.37 cents for Y
E 2001 from 1.85 cents for YE 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Passenger services expenses increased 22%, or $1.9 million, in YE 2001 compared with YE 2000.  In 2001, the Company significantly increased its efforts to accommodate passengers impacted by a schedule irregularity, including adoption of more liberal policies to reaccommodate passengers on other airlines. These costs totaled $0.6 million more in YE 2001 compared with YE 2000.  In  2001, the Company entered into interline agreements with several other airlines, in part to reduce such reaccommodation costs.  During 2Q 2001, the Company also began issuing vouchers redeemable for a specific dollar value toward the purchase of a future ticket on Vanguard in situations where a passenger could be accommodated on another Vanguard flight but was still inconvenienced by a number of hours due to a schedule irregularity.  These vouchers aggregated $1.2 million in YE 2001.  The value of the vouchers is recorded as air traffic liability when issued and will be included in revenue when the vouchers ar
e redeemed.  Passenger services costs increased on a cents per ASM basis to 0.62 cents for YE 2001 from 0.52 cents for YE 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Promotion and sales expenses decreased 4.9%, or $0.9 million, in YE 2001 compared with YE 2000.  Advertising fees decreased $4.2 million during YE 2001, primarily due to a reduction in direct advertising.  This decrease was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in fees for booking reservations through travel agent global distribution systems and Sabre&trade; reservation system fees in YE 2001 as compared to YE 2000, as expected with the Company's switch to the Sabre&trade; reservation system. During 2Q 2001, the Company'consumer affairs department began issuing vouchers redeemable for a specific dollar value toward the purchase of a future ticket on Vanguard in situations where warranted to resolve a customer complaint.  These vouchers accounted for a total of $0.4 million in YE 2001. Promotion and sales expenses decreased on a cents per ASM basis to 1.09 cents for YE 2001 from 1.16 cents for YE 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;General and administrative expenses increased 41%, or $1.8 million, in the YE 2001 compared with YE 2000, due in part to increased management staffing, and outsourcing of revenue accounting associated with the transition to Sabre in 2Q 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Aircraft return and lease termination costs consist of costs principally associated with the return of eight Boeing 737-200 aircraft completed or committed to during 2001.  During YE 2001, the Company returned six aircraft at or prior to the end of the respective leases.  As a result, the Company incurred several charges including the write-off of aircraft leasehold costs associated with these aircraft of approximately $1.0 million, loss of certain aircraft deposits and other related assets of approximately $0.5 million, and maintenance expense related to the return of the aircraft of approximately $0.7 million.  On December 27, 2001, the Company committed to terminate lease agreements relating to two aircraft which were taken out of service on January 8, 2002 and February 15, 2002, respectively, pursuant to negotiated early return provisions.</FONT>  <FONT SIZE=2>As a result, the Company expects to incur approximately $0.8 million in lease termination fees, approximately $0.8 million 
loss from the forfeiture of security deposits held by the lessors, approximately $0.9 million in rental fees for the periods the aircraft will be out of service prior to their return dates and approximately $0.2 million of maintenance and other costs related to that the return of the aircraft.  The Company is seeking to negotiate a reduction in this liability.</P>

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest expense, net of interest income, and amortization of warrants and fees issued for certain financing transactions and, in 2001, federal grant assistance.  Other (income) expense for YE 2001 included (i) $5.3 million of interest expense, net of interest income, which includes $4.1 million of expense resulting from the accounting treatment of the VAC Transaction in 2001 ($0.1 million of net interest income in YE 2000), (ii) $1.2 million of expense for the amortization of the estimated fair value of warrants issued in connection with financing activities ($0.8 million in YE 2000), (iii) $0.4 million of expense resulting from the amortization of fees associated with the acquisition of leased aircraft ($0.1 million in YE 2000) and (iv) $7.3 million of income resulting from the receipt of federal grant assistance in 2001 provided to offset the Company's direct and indirect losses resulting from the September 11 terrorist attacks.</P>

<P>Operating Revenues - 2000 Compared to 1999</P>
</B></I>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Total operating revenues increased 5% to $131.8 million for YE 2000 from $125.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31,1999 (&quot;YE 1999&quot;), while the Company's scope of operations, as measured by ASMs, increased 26%.  The Company increased its average fares 6%, while the average stage length (length of flight) increased 13%, resulting in a 6% decline in passenger yield.  The Company's departures increased 10%, but its number of passengers remained flat, resulting in a 6.8 percentage point drop in passenger load factor.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 13% to 963 million for YE 2000 from 855 million for YE 1999, primarily as a result of the increase in average stage length following the reconfiguration of the Company's route structure to a Kansas City hub offering medium-to-long haul connecting service.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to increased fuel costs, the Company initiated a fuel surcharge for certain routes beginning in April 2000 and continuing for the remainder of the year.  These charges were recognized as passenger revenue as travel was flown.  The fuel surcharge was eliminated in January 2001.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Non-refundable fares that are forfeited as well as estimated forfeitures of future travel credits totaled $9.4 million in YE 2000 and $12.4 million for YE 1999.  Other revenues consist of ticket change service fees, charter revenue, liquor sales, and mail cargo revenues. Service fees were $4.8 million in YE 2000 and $5.1 million in YE 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P>Operating Expenses - 2000 Compared to 1999</P>
</B></I>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flying operations expenses increased 25% in YE 2000, in proportion to the increased scope of operations as measured by ASMs.  Flying operations expense decreased on a cents per ASM basis to 1.82 cents for YE 2000 from 1.84 cents for YE 1999.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aircraft fuel expense increased 86% in YE 2000 from YE 1999.  The average price per gallon of fuel (including taxes and into-plane costs) increased 58% to $1.05 per gallon in YE 2000 from $0.67 per gallon in YE 1999. This increase in the cost of fuel accounted for approximately $13.7 million of the increase in total operating expenses in YE 2000 over YE 1999.  Consumption of gallons of fuel increased 18% in YE 2000 from YE 1999, as the increase in scope of operations was partly offset by the greater efficiency from operating a longer average stage length.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maintenance expenses increased 3% in YE 2000 from YE 1999, considerably less than the 25% increase in operations.  Maintenance expense decreased on a cents per ASM basis to 1.85 cents for YE 2000 from 2.25 cents for YE 1999 because of significant unscheduled maintenance events in YE 1999 which did not recur in YE 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aircraft and traffic servicing expense increased 13% in YE 2000 from YE 1999.  On a cents per ASM basis, aircraft and traffic servicing expenses decreased to 1.44 cents for YE 2000 from 1.61 cents for YE 1999 due in part to the longer average length of haul.  Measured on a unit cost per departure, aircraft servicing and traffic expense increased slightly, as the number of departures increased only 10% over the same period.  Higher costs per departure for airports served in YE 2000 were partly offset by approximately $1.0 million savings in landing fees at Chicago-Midway as a result of the Company's obtaining signatory status and a partial rebate of prior fees charged.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Promotion and sales expenses decreased 6% in YE 2000 from YE 1999.  A reduction in travel agency commission rates to 5% from 8% in October 1999 reduced agency commissions approximately $1.2 million in YE 2000 over the prior year.  The Company's implementation of internet booking capability in October 1999 resulted in an estimated $0.5 million decrease in reservation expense in YE 2000 as compared to the prior year.  On a cents per ASM basis, promotion and sales expense decreased to 1.16 cents for YE 2000 from 1.55 cents for YE 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other expense, net consists primarily of debt issuance cost amortization, interest income and interest expense.  In order to obtain guarantees and letters of credit to secure its credit card processor, the Company has issued certain stockholder warrants, as further discussed below.  The estimated fair value of the warrants issued was $0.2 million for YE 2000 and $0.9 million for YE 1999.  These amounts were recorded as deferred debt issuance costs and were amortized to expense over the term of the guarantee.  Interest income decreased during the YE 2000 as a result of the Company's reduced cash position.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</P>

</B><P>The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of the Company's financial statements: passenger revenue recognition, accounting for major maintenance expense and estimates of potential asset value impairment.</P>

<B><I><P>Passenger Revenue Recognition</P>

</B></I><P>Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as unearned revenue, included on the balance sheets as air traffic liability.<B>  </B>Revenue is generally recognized at the time transportation is provided.  A majority of the Company's sold tickets are non-refundable and the Company's fare rules generally do not allow unused non-refundable fares to be applied as a credit against future travel if the change is not requested before the reserved flight date.  When forfeited, the fare value of unused tickets is recognized in passenger revenue.  The Company recognizes revenue for an estimate of unused tickets that will never be presented for exchange each month.  These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary based on actual presentments.</P>

<B><I><P>Accounting for Major Maintenance Expense</P>

</B></I><P>The Company accounts for major aircraft and engine maintenance costs using a combination of accrual and direct expense methods. The Company expenses periodic maintenance payments made to its aircraft lessors (&quot;Maintenance Reserves&quot;) based on the rate per flight hour or cycle specified in the leases.  These Maintenance Reserves are available to the Company to pay for the major maintenance events defined in the aircraft leases as they are incurred and will be retained by the lessors at return of the aircraft.  The Company accrues the estimated cost of the next major aircraft maintenance event, for which no Maintenance Reserves are available, based on aircraft utilization and the anticipated cost of such event.  No provision is made for unscheduled maintenance and such costs are expensed as incurred.</P>

<B><I><P>Estimates of Potential Asset Value Impairment</P>

</B></I><P>The Company periodically reviews the recorded values of its assets that may be subject to impairments in value and records adjustments to the recorded values of such assets or establishes appropriate reserves to reflect such impairment.  Specific asset categories are treated as follows:</P>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Accounts Receivable: The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management's expectation of collectibility of current and past due accounts receivable.</LI>
<LI>Inventories: The Company records the value of its inventories at the lower of original cost or market.  Management reviews market conditions to determine if and when impairments to inventory values have occurred and an adjustment to a lower market value is warranted.  </LI>
<LI>Property and Equipment, including Aircraft Rotable Parts: The Company depreciates its property and equipment over various useful lives ranging from five to ten years.  Similar to inventories, adjustments are made as warranted when management's review of market conditions and values suggest that the current value of an asset is less than its net book value.</LI></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Liquidity and Capital Resources</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the Company has, to date, lost access to the unsecured private capital markets.  The Company requires additional debt or equity financing to fund ongoing operations in 2002. The Company is seeking to raise additional capital and is applying for federal loan guarantees authorized by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (&quot;ATSSSA&quot;); however, there can be no assurance that such capital can be obtained.  The inability to secure additional funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including the likelihood that the Company could have to cease operations.  The Company has aggressively addressed the ATSB's concerns.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company filed its original application for a federal loan guarantee with the Air Transportation Stabilization Board (&quot;ATSB&quot;) on December 6, 2001 and has filed several revisions in response to comments from the ATSB.  The ATSB has questioned the Company's eligibility for a loan, in part on account of the Company's relatively small scope of operations.  The Company is aggressively countering such concerns by providing the ATSB with data demonstrating the importance to a competitive national transportation system of low fare airlines like Vanguard, as well as Vanguard's projected ability to repay the loan based on its current business plan.  Although there can be no promises as to future results, management believes the Company has a viable business plan that can lead to sustained profitability, as demonstrated by the Company's recent results as compared to general industry results.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company is also seeking to restructure its existing vendor payables, aircraft lease obligations, and equity interests, including in connection with the receipt of new financing either with, or without, the federal loan guarantees. The Company intends to reduce its existing payables by an amount that has not been finally determined and to restructure its aircraft lease obligations to reflect fair market lease values.  The Company's Board of Directors has approved a one-for-five reverse stock split which would reduce the number of shares of Vanguard common stock outstanding or reserved for issuance, thereby creating a larger pool of unissued and unreserved shares available for issuance to new investors in connection with the contemplated financings.  The issuance of common stock or common stock purchase rights in connection with such restructuring or financings may substantially dilute the interests of existing stockholders.  There can be no assurance that such restructuring can be a
ccomplished.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company continues actions designed to achieve long-term profitability and improve its capital resources. Management's strategy to achieve long-term profitability includes building connecting traffic at its Kansas City hub through strategic routes, increasing yields through improved revenue management processes and automation, fleet renewal, improving customer service, adding new cities to increase connecting opportunities, increasing efforts to attract and retain price-sensitive business travelers and continuing cost savings programs.  There can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As a result of the Company's operating losses and limited financial resources, the Company's independent auditors have expressed a &quot;going concern&quot; qualification on the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2001.  The Company had a working capital deficiency and stockholders' deficit at December 31, 2001 of approximately $45 million and $29 million, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company funded its net loss in 2001 from a variety of sources.  The primary source was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, net of non-cash items, of $17.1 million resulting in general from the deferral of payments, principally to aircraft lessors, in some cases causing contractual defaults.  The second largest source was the issuance of equity (preferred and common stock) for gross proceeds of approximately $7.75 million.  The third largest source was a $6.0 million increase in air traffic liability resulting from an increase in advance ticket sales.  The net loss also includes $10.5 million of noncash items, including $4.3 million of depreciation and amortization, $4.1 attributable to accounting charges related to the VAC Transaction, and $2.2 million of accruals related to the early termination of aircraft leases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In addition to funding operations, the Company's cash requirements during 2001 included a $3.1 million increase in deposits and prepaid expenses and $2.3 million of capital expenditures.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of December 31, 2001, the Company's cash balances included $3.6 million attributable to the deferral of payments of federal excise taxes as permitted by the government in response to the events of September 11, 2001.  The Company's holding of such taxes also resulted in an equal increase to the Company's air traffic liability account as of December 31, 2001.  Such taxes were paid on January 15, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since inception, the Company has financed its operations and met its capital expenditure requirements primarily with proceeds from public and private sales of equity and debt securities.  Prior to 2001, such financings have been made possible by two principal stockholders, The Hambrecht 1980 Revocable Trust and the J. F. Shea Company (together, the &quot;H/S Investors&quot;).  In 2001, such financings were made possible primarily by Vanguard Acquisition Company (&quot;VAC&quot;), an affiliate of Pegasus Aviation.  VAC currently holds approximately 37% of the Company's issued and outstanding voting securities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first and second quarters of 2001, the Company negotiated lease deferral agreements with certain of its aircraft lessors.  As of December 31, 2001, the Company had issued approximately $7.0 million of long-term debt to satisfy amounts payable to these lessors, net of $0.7 million of accounts receivable from certain of these lessors for reimbursement of certain maintenance expenses.  Additionally, the Company had issued a note for approximately $1.0 million to a lessor to satisfy its maintenance obligation at the time of return of the aircraft.  Repayment of these loans, including accrued interest at 10%, generally was scheduled to commence in July 2001 with maturities varying through December 2002.  To date, the Company has not made any payments required under these loans and has, therefore, classified them as current liabilities in the financial statements at December 31, 2001.</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company has also not made certain payments required under certain aircraft leases after application of the negotiated deferral agreements.  All required lease payments (and interest at contractual rates) due under the Company's lease agreements (without acceleration) with respect to periods through December 31, 2001, have been accrued in the statements of operations and all such amounts which had not been paid as of December 31, 2001, are reflected as accounts payable in the balance sheets.  The Company has received notices of default from certain of its aircraft lessors. The Company is seeking revised repayment terms (including forgiveness of certain accrued payables and reductions in future rental obligations) from all its aircraft lessors in connection with the Company's efforts to obtain new financing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company has also not made certain payments required under its leases with various airport authorities and required under certain other contractual agreements.  All required payments due under these lease and contractual agreements (without acceleration) with respect to periods through December 31, 2001 have been accrued in the statements of operations and all such amounts which had not been paid as of December 31, 2001, are reflected as accounts payable in the balance sheets.  The Company intends to seek revised repayment terms for these obligations in connection with the Company's efforts to obtain new financing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company continues to review its alternatives to purchase or lease additional aircraft under suitable terms.  In connection with closing the VAC Transaction, the Company entered an agreement providing Pegasus Aviation status as a preferred supplier of aircraft leased or purchased by the Company, including certain rights of first refusal in the event the Company seeks to lease additional aircraft.  The Company has agreed to lease eight MD-80 aircraft from Pegasus Aviation, five of which have been delivered to the Company.  The Company is required to provide lease deposits aggregating $2.3 million with respect to these aircraft, of which $0.6 million was deposited in the first quarter of 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nearly all of the Company's ticket sales are charged to credit cards.  The bank which processes the Company's credit card receipts requires the Company to provide collateral to secure payments made with respect to tickets sold but not yet flown.  The Company currently has a total of $10 million in available security instruments that may be used to collateralize its exposure with the bank.  To the extent that the credit card exposure (as defined) exceeds $10 million, the bank withholds cash generated by new ticket sales in a restricted account to provide collateral for the amount of the exposure above $10 million.  The $10 million security instruments consist of a $4 million letter of credit (the &quot;LOC&quot;) provided by two of the Company's principal stockholders and a $6 million surety bond (the &quot;Surety Bond&quot;) provided by North American Specialty Insurance Company.  The bank has advised the Company that it will cease processing the Company's credit card receivables on March 
31, 2002, as a result of the bank ceasing this line of business in general.  The Company has obtained a non-binding agreement in principle from a new bank to assume such functions; however, the new bank has been unwilling to accept a surety bond as collateral.  Accordingly, the Company must obtain replacement collateral satisfactory to the new processor or the new processor will withhold funds when its exposure exceeds $4 million.  The Company also must obtain the approval of the old bank and the stockholders providing the letters of credit that such letters of credit may also be used to secure the new bank.  There can be no assurance that timely arrangements can be completed that allow the Company continued access to cash from credit card sales.  If such arrangements are not obtained, the Company could be required to cease operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In July 2001, the Company was notified by Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) that its Letter of Credit securing cash transactions was under-funded according to ARC's cash reserve requirements.  In addition, the Company was notified during 2001 by two of its credit card processors (not secured by the surety bond referred to above) that its collateral balances were under-funded. As of March 1, 2002, the Company posted an aggregate of $1.1 million additional cash collateral to fund these reserves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On April 12, 2001, the Company entered into an Aircraft Spare Parts Support Agreement with an aircraft components supply company (the &quot;Supplier&quot;) under which the Supplier would allow the Company to have access to up to $2.0 million of spare parts inventory for the Company's MD-80 aircraft.  The Company pays a monthly fee for this access and is responsible for replacement of any parts used.  As of December 31, 2001, the Company has received approximately $1.8 million of parts under this agreement. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company expects to expend approximately $10.0 million on various capital expenditures in 2002, which are primarily related to increased aircraft parts inventory levels, additional airport ground equipment and improvements to its computer systems.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Unless otherwise described, the net proceeds from the following transactions were added to the Company's working capital and used to fund the Company's operating cash requirements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On February 14, 2001, the H/S Investors agreed to renew for a two-year period the letters of credit securing a portion of the funds held by the Company's credit card processor.  In consideration for the establishment of the letters of credit, the Company issued to the H/S Investors warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.17.  All warrants have since vested and, in connection with the VAC Transaction discussed below, the exercise price of the warrants was adjusted to $0.50 per share.  Under the terms of this agreement, the Company was required to reduce the amount of these letters of credit by specified amounts on a quarterly basis beginning June 30, 2001.  The Company has not made these required reductions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On March 9, 2001, the Company issued 162,500 shares of a new issue of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to VAC in exchange for a capital investment of $3.25 million.  The Series C Convertible Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $20 per share, subject to annual accretion over three years, and is convertible into common stock at a price of $1.25 per share of common stock.  On April 9, 2001, the Company issued an additional 25,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock to VAC in exchange for a further capital investment of $0.5 million.  [The Series C Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company in an amount equal to the conversion terms.]</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On April 30, 2001, the Company executed a term sheet providing for certain investors to purchase up to 37.5 million shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $7.5 million or $0.20 per share of common stock and to loan up to the purchase price of the common stock to the Company in advance of the closing of the equity transaction.  One condition to the investors' obligation to close the transaction was the modification of the repricing provisions contained in certain warrants and the Company's Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, which warrants (the &quot;Repriced Warrants&quot;) and preferred stock were held by investors committing to take a minority share of the new investment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In May 2001, VAC (who committed to provide the majority of the new investment) provided bridge loans totaling $3.5 million to the Company in the form of a demand note bearing interest at an annual rate of 9%.  Other investors provided an additional $1.0 million in demand notes on June 21, 2001 with interest at an annual rate of 9%.  On July 12, 2001, these demand notes were applied to the purchase of common stock (the &quot;VAC Transaction&quot;) at which time the $4.5 million of demand notes, plus $5,249 of accrued interest, were exchanged for 22,526,249 shares of common stock.  At closing, the holders of the Company's outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock waived certain anti-dilution rights and modified the antidilution provisions of the Repriced Warrants with the result that the exercise price of warrants to purchase approximately 13.6 million shares of common stock, held by two of the Company's principal investors, was adjusted to $0.50 per sha
re.  Absent the agreement of these holders to such modification, the exercise price of the Repriced Warrants would have adjusted to $.20 pursuant to the terms of the antidilution provisions contained in such warrants.  An additional 2,500,000 shares of common stock, reserved for issuance to certain financial advisors to the Company in exchange for the cancellation of $0.5 million of fees owed to them, were not issued pending possible restructuring of such portion of the investment.  In March 2002, the Company agreed to issue to such advisor warrants to purchase 3,500,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $0.24782 in lieu of the issuance of such shares of common stock and other warrants to which the financial advisor was contractually entitled.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1)&#9;At December 31, 2001, all of the Company's long-term debt was in default due to delinquent payments.  Accordingly, all debt amounts have been classified as current liabilities on the balance sheet.</P>

</B></I><P>At December 31, 2001, the Company has committed to lease a total of eight Boeing MD-80 series aircraft from Pegasus Aviation, who may be deemed a related party, and has options to lease two additional aircraft.  During 2001, the Company accepted delivery of five of these aircraft and has included the payments under these leases in the table above as operating leases.  The Company expects the remaining three aircraft to be delivered during 2002. The Company has not exercised its remaining two options.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company has commodity price risk in that it must purchase jet fuel to operate its aircraft and the Company's earnings are affected by changes in the price of aircraft fuel.  At the present time, management does not utilize fuel price hedging instruments to reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices.  Any substantial increase in the price of fuel, or any curtailment in the availability of fuel, could have an adverse effect on the Company.  The price the Company pays for aviation fuel has varied from $1.20 to $0.58 per gallon over the last three years.  General market conditions could result in further substantial increases in the price of fuel.  Based on actual fuel usage during YE 2001, each 10-cent increase in the price per gallon of fuel adds $3.3 million of annual expense to the Company.  Although the Company has sought from time to time to pass increases in fuel costs through to consumers (in accordance with general practice in the industry), such efforts may 
put the Company at a competitive disadvantage and may result in decreases in traffic that offset the increase in ticket prices.</P>

<P>Vanguard Airlines, Inc.</P>

<P>We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Vanguard Airlines, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.</P>

<P>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vanguard Airlines, Inc. as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.</P>

<P>The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and has a working capital deficiency and net capital deficiency. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

<I><P>See accompanying notes.</P>
</I></FONT><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Significant Accounting Policies</P>
<P>Nature of Business</P>
</B>
<P>Vanguard Airlines, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in April 1994 and commenced flight operations on December 4, 1994. The Company offers value-priced, low-fare, medium- to long-haul passenger air transportation service from its hub in Kansas&nbsp;City, Missouri to destinations in the United States.</P>

<P>The airline industry has been highly competitive since passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, which eliminated government control over domestic fares and rates.</P>

<P>The airline industry is significantly affected by general economic conditions.<B> </B>Because a substantial portion of business and personal airline travel is discretionary, the industry generally has experienced adverse financial results during general economic downturns. The Company's business is also seasonal, as peak travel times typically occur during April through September, which can affect the Company's results of operations from quarter to quarter. A prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and profitability. </P>
<P>Fuel is a major component of operating expenses for all airlines. Both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world. The future cost and availability of fuel to the Company cannot be predicted, and substantial sustained price increases or the inability to obtain adequate fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and profitability.</P>

<B><P>Use of Estimates</P>
</B>
<P>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>

<B><P>Cash and Cash Equivalents</P>
</B><P>The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)</P>
</B>
<B><P>Restricted Cash</P>
</B>
<P>Restricted cash includes cash equivalents that secure the risk of loss exposure estimated by the Company's credit card processors. During 2001 and 2000, the risk of loss exposure for the Company's largest credit card processor was calculated daily. Subsequent to <BR>
July 6, 2001, if the risk of loss exposure exceeded $10,000,000 (the amount secured by a $4,000,000 letter of credit discussed in Note 8 and a $6,000,000 surety bond), the Company was required to maintain a restricted cash balance in an amount equal to the additional exposure. During 2000 and through July 6, 2001, if the risk of loss exposure exceeded $12,000,000 (the amount secured by a $4,000,000 letter of credit discussed in Note 8 and an $8,000,000 surety bond), the Company was required to maintain a restricted cash balance in an amount equal to the additional exposure. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, no restricted cash balance related to this credit card processor was required, as the risk of loss exposure calculated on those dates did not exceed $10,000,000 or $12,000,000, respectively. Other credit card processors require the Company to maintain deposits as security for their risk of loss exposure. The risk of loss exposure for these credit card processors are reviewed periodically. At December 31, 200
1 and 2000, the restricted cash balance related to these credit card processors totaled $701,030 and $357,746, respectively, is considered noncurrent and is included as a component of other assets on the accompanying balance sheets.</P>

<B><P>Accounts Receivable</P>
</B>
<P>Accounts receivable are primarily due from major credit card processors and travel agents.<B> </B>These receivables are unsecured. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of accounts receivable.</P>

<B><P>Inventories</P>
</B>
<P>Inventories of certain flight equipment, expendable parts, materials, tools, food, beverages, and promotional items are carried at the lower of cost or market. These items are charged to expense when issued for use under the first-in, first-out method. During 2001, management determined that certain aircraft spare parts previously included in property and equipment would be more appropriately classified as expendable inventories. As such, approximately $1,720,000 of these parts was reclassified from aircraft engines and rotable inventory to expendable inventories.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)</P>
</B>
<P>Under agreements to lease parts and supplies for its Boeing 737-200 and MD-80 aircraft, one of which is with a related party, the Company is required to pay monthly fees, based on the value of the leased parts, and to replenish any such parts when used with a like part. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company held leased parts and supplies of approximately $4,013,000 and $2,129,000, respectively, which are not included in the accompanying balance sheets. Approximately $1,534,000 of these parts and supplies were provided by a related party at December 31, 2001. None of these leased parts and supplies at December 31, 2000 were provided by a related party.</P>

<B><P>Property and Equipment</P>
</B>
<P>Depreciation and amortization of aircraft improvements and leasehold costs are recorded using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms of the related aircraft, whichever is shorter, ranging from five to seven years. Aircraft engines and rotable parts remaining in property and equipment after the reclassification discussed above are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of five years in 1999 and 2000 and ten years in 2001. During 2001, and in conjunction with the Company's more extensive leasing of MD-80 aircraft and the reclassification of certain aircraft space parts from rotable parts to expendable inventories, as discussed above, the useful lives of remaining rotable parts were changed to ten years. The impact of this change in estimated useful lives on current year net loss was approximately $680,000, or $0.02 per share. Reservation system and communication equipment and other property and equipment are depreciated or amortize
d on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms ranging from five to seven years.</P>

<B><P>Deferred Debt Issuance Costs</P>
</B>
<P>Debt fees, closing, and other costs incurred in obtaining financing have been capitalized and are amortized over the term of the debt.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)</P>
</B>
<B><P>Aircraft and Engine Maintenance</P>
</B>
<P>The Company accounts for aircraft overhaul and major engine maintenance costs using a combination of accrual and direct expense methods. The Company expenses periodic maintenance payments made to its aircraft lessors based on the rate per flight hour or cycle specified in the leases. The Company accrues the estimated cost of the next aircraft overhaul based on aircraft utilization for anticipated maintenance costs for which no periodic maintenance payments are made to the lessor. The cost of other routine maintenance is charged to expense as incurred. </P>
<B>
<P>Advertising Costs</P>
</B>
<P>Advertising costs are charged to expense in the period the costs are incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $3,039,000, $6,994,000, and $6,989,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The fair market value of advertising received in exchange for passenger tickets, included in advertising expense, was approximately $146,000, $899,000, and $1,146,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.</P>

<B><P>Concentrations of Credit Risk</P>
</B>
<P>Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash with high quality financial institutions and at times may exceed federally insured deposit limits.</P>

<B><P>Passenger Revenue Recognition</P>
</B>
<P>Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of air traffic liability.<B> </B>Revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time transportation is provided.<B> </B>Where passengers do not show up for flights booked on nonrefundable tickets,<B> </B>the Company recognizes revenue for such unused tickets based on an estimate of such tickets that will never be presented for exchange in the month in which the no-show occurs. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>
<B><P>1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)</P>
</B>
<B><P>Stock-Based Compensation</P>
</B>
<P>The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, <I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees</I>, and related Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options, because, as discussed in Note 5, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, <I>Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation</I>, requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.</P>

<P>Pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method of that statement. This pro forma information is included in Note 5.</P>

<B><P>Defined Contribution Plan</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan (the Plan) covering substantially all employees. Participants may contribute a portion of their pay to the Plan. The Company matches participant contributions to the Plan equal to 100% of the first 3% of each participant's compensation deferral. Contributions made by the Company amounted to approximately $407,000, $414,000, and $380,000 during 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.</P>

<B><P>Loss Per Share</P>
</B>
<P>The Company calculates basic loss per share based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding in accordance with SFAS No. 128, <I>Earnings Per Share,</I> by excluding the effect of dilutive stock options. In all years presented herein, the computation of diluted net loss per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, as outstanding convertible preferred stock, stock options, and warrants were antidilutive. These securities, described in Note 4<I>,</I> could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future.</P>

<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)</P>
</B>
<B><P>Income Taxes</P>
</B>
<P>The Company utilizes the liability method in accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities utilizing enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.</P>

<B><P>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</P>
</B>
<P>The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and deposits reported in the balance sheets approximate fair value. The fair values of warrants issued in 2001, 2000, and 1999, as described in Notes 4 and 7, were estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. It is not practicable to determine the fair value of the Company's long-term debt and related-party notes payable due to the majority of the debt being in default and uncertainty regarding the ability of the Company to issue additional debt securities.</P>

<B><P>Reclassification</P>
</B>
<P>Certain amounts in the 2000 and 1999 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2001 presentation. In 2001, the Company revised its presentation of supplemental maintenance deposits paid to its aircraft lessors to net them against the corresponding accrued maintenance liabilities that would be funded through the future application of deposits to required aircraft maintenance. This presentation reflects the provisions of the Company's aircraft leases which allow for such deposits to be retained by lessors at aircraft lease expiration to meet the specified return condition. Accordingly, such amounts reflected in the December 31, 2000 balance sheet have been reclassified.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Basis of Presentation</P>
</B>
<P>The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $30,914,000 and a use of cash in operating activities of approximately $1,290,000. The Company's cash requirements were satisfied through increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and through the </P>

<B><P>2. Basis of Presentation (continued)</P>
</B>
<P>issuance of debt and equity securities. The Company had a working capital deficiency and stockholders' deficit at December 31, 2001 of approximately $43,728,000 and $29,035,000, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company anticipates that additional debt or equity financing will be required to fund ongoing operations in 2002. The Company intends to seek revised payment terms and reductions in amounts owed from its lessors and vendors in connection with its efforts to obtain financing. A number of lessors and venders have tentatively agreed to such revisions and reductions, subject to a number of conditions being met; however there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully meet these conditions or obtain sufficient revisions and reductions to attract new financing. The Company is also currently negotiating to raise additional capital, including applying for loan guarantees from the federal government (see Note 1
1). However, there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully complete these transactions or, if completed, the amounts will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations in 2002. The inability to secure additional funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including the possibility that the Company could have to cease operations.</P>

<B><P>3. Long-Term Debt and Related-Party Notes Payable (continued)</P>
</B><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(a)&#9;In December 2000, the Company entered into a loan agreement with a related-party to borrow $3,000,000 secured by aircraft spare parts. The Company received approximately $2,595,000 in cash net of the first loan payment, a security deposit, and loan costs. This loan agreement provides for the Company to borrow up to an additional $1,000,000 under substantially the same terms as the initial loan. As of December 31, 2001, no additional borrowings had been made against this facility. At December 31, 2001, $2,175,095 of this debt was in default due to delinquent payments. Accordingly, this amount has been classified as a current liability on the accompanying balance sheets.</P>

<P>(b)&#9;In 2001, the Company entered into lease deferral notes payable for approximately $5,582,000, including approximately $200,000 of accrued interest, with certain of its aircraft lessors. Additionally in 2001, the Company issued a note payable for $999,000 to a lessor to satisfy its maintenance obligation at the scheduled return of an aircraft. At December 31, 2001, $5,922,647 of these notes were in default due to delinquent payments. Accordingly, this amount has been classified as a current liability on the accompanying balance sheets. These notes are callable upon demand and the Company is accruing penalty interest at an annual rate of 14%.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In May 2001, Vanguard Acquisition Company (VAC) provided bridge loans totaling $3,500,000 to the Company in the form of a demand note bearing interest at an annual rate of 9%. Other related investors provided an additional $1,000,000 in demand notes on June 21, 2001 with interest at an annual rate of 9%. On July 12, 2001, these demand notes were applied to a purchase of common stock (the VAC Transaction), at which time the $4,500,000 of demand notes were exchanged for 22,526,249 shares of common stock. See Note 4.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2000, the Company issued a total of $7,500,000 of unsecured 10.5% convertible demand notes payable to certain principal stockholders of the Company. The Company converted unsecured demand notes plus accrued interest totaling $4,051,492 in September&nbsp;2000 to common stock, as described in Note 4. The remaining $3,500,000 of demand notes was converted to Series B Preferred Stock in December 2000, as described in Note&nbsp;4.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>3. Long-Term Debt and Related-Party Notes Payable (continued)</P>
</B>
<P>The Company recorded related-party interest expense (including $4,100,000 of debt discount amortization in 2001, related to the VAC Transaction discussed above and in Note 4, but excluding deferred debt issuance costs amortization) during 2001 and 2000 of approximately $5,344,000 and $87,000, respectively (see Note 4). No related-party interest expense was incurred during 1999. Interest payments to related parties in 2001 were $203,478. There were no interest payments made to related parties in 2000 and 1999.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Stockholders' Equity</P>
</B>
<P>On May 18, 1999, the Company's stockholders approved a one-for-five reverse stock split to stockholders of record on that date resulting in a reduction of 68,297,847 shares of the outstanding common stock. The par value per share remained at $0.001 per share, and 200,000,000 common shares remained authorized. All historical information presented in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes has been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. By an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation filed May 31, 2000, the number of authorized common shares was reduced to 100,000,000.</P>

<P>The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, (the Series A Preferred Stock) is not redeemable and pays dividends at an annual rate of $0.80 per share only when, and if, declared by the Company's Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, as of December 31, 2001, has declared no dividends. The liquidation preference of each share of Series A Preferred Stock is $10 plus any declared and unpaid dividends. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock was convertible into four shares of common stock subject to certain antidilution adjustments (after considering antidilution adjustments, each share is convertible into approximately 8.55 shares of common stock at December 31, 2001), and holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to common stock voting rights determined on an as-converted basis.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On September 8, 2000, the Company issued to certain principal stockholders 2,359,223 units of securities at approximately $1.72 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and a common stock purchase warrant. In connection therewith, the Company converted $4,051,492 of outstanding principal and accrued interest on related-party demand notes payable to common stock under the terms of the agreement. Each warrant in the unit, which expires on September 8, 2007 if not exercised, </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Stockholders' Equity (continued)</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $1.89 per share, at issuance. In 2001, these warrants were repriced from $1.89 per share to $0.50 per share as part of the 2001 warrant repricing and VAC Transaction discussed below.</P>

<P>On December 15, 2000, the Company issued to certain principal stockholders 100,000 units of securities at $75 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, (the Series B Preferred Stock) and a common stock purchase warrant. In connection therewith, the Company received $4,000,000 of cash and converted $3,500,000 of outstanding principal on related-party demand notes payable to Series B Preferred Stock under the terms of the agreement. Each warrant in the unit, which expires on December 15, 2007 if not exercised, entitles the holder to purchase 64 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.29 per share. In 2001, these warrants were repriced from $1.29 per share to $0.50 per share as part of the 2001 warrant repricing and VAC Transaction discussed below. In accordance with the antidilution terms of the September 8, 2000 transaction, and simultaneous with the December 2000 offering, 1,103,593 shares of common stock were issued to the p
urchasers of common stock (who were also the purchasers of the Series B Preferred Stock).</P>

<P>The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable and pays dividends at an annual rate of $5.75 per share only when, and if, declared by the Company's Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, as of December 31, 2001 has declared no dividends. The liquidation preference of each share of Series B Preferred Stock is $75 plus any declared and unpaid dividends. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into approximately 64&nbsp;shares of common stock (subject to certain antidilution adjustments) at any time, and holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to common stock voting rights determined on an as-converted basis.</P>

<P>On March 9, 2001, the Company issued 162,500 shares of a new issue of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, (the Series C Preferred Stock) to VAC in exchange for a capital investment of $3,250,000. On April 9, 2001, the Company issued an additional 25,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock to VAC in exchange for a capital investment of $500,000. The Series C Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $20 per share, subject to annual accretion over three years, and is </P>

<B><P>4. Stockholders' Equity (continued)</P>
</B>
<P>convertible into common stock at a price of $1.25 per share of common stock. Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to common stock voting rights determined on an as-converted basis and are entitled to dividends only when, and if, declared by the Board of Directors at a per share amount equal to common stock dividends. The Board of Directors, as of December 31, 2001, has declared no dividends. The Series C Preferred Stock is redeemable only at the option of the Company in an amount equal to the liquidation preference.</P>

<P>On April 30, 2001, the Company executed a term sheet providing for certain investors to purchase up to 37.5 million shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $7,500,000 or $0.20 per share of common stock and to provide interim financing to the Company in an amount up to the purchase price of the common stock in advance of the closing of the equity transaction. Conditions to the investors' obligation to close the transaction included the modification of repricing provisions pertaining to certain warrants and the Company's Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. Such warrants and preferred stock were held by certain investors committing to take a minority share of the new investment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>At closing of the VAC Transaction (see Note 3), the holders of the Company's outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock waived certain antidilution rights and modified the antidilution provisions of the Repriced Warrants resulting in the exercise price of warrants to purchase approximately<BR>
13.6 million shares of common stock, held by two of the Company's principal stockholders, being adjusted to $0.50 per share.</P>

<P>As a result of the deferred feature of the VAC Transaction, whereby the investment was initially advanced as debt and then applied to the equity purchase upon the satisfaction of all conditions to the equity investment, and because the common stock investment was sold at a price less than market, the Company accounted for these transactions as debt issued with common stock purchase rights. Under APB Opinion No. 14, <I>Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued With Stock Purchase Warrants</I>, the $4.5 million debt proceeds have been allocated to the common stock purchase rights, the warrant repricing, and the demand notes payable based on their relative values. This accounting treatment results in $4.1 million of the debt proceeds being allocated to debt discount, which was amortized to interest expense in 2001.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 1999, the Company granted options outside of the Option Plans to purchase 664,322&nbsp;shares of common stock to certain officers of the Company. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 1999 is $2.23. During 2000 and 2001, 98,677 and 74,426 options, respectively, were forfeited. In addition, 1,004 of these options were exercised during 2000. At December 31, 2001, 490,215 options were outstanding and exercisable. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of options outstanding is 8.36 years. The exercise price for 487 options equals $0.50 and for 489,728 options ranges from $3.94 to $4.81. The options vest ranging from two to four years and have a contractual term of ten years from the date of issuance. During 2000, the Company granted options outside of the Option Plans to an officer of the Company to purchase 1,155,586 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.63, all of which were forfeited in 2001. The fair value of these options granted during 2

<P>The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, the option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. Employee Stock Purchase Plan</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted the Vanguard Airlines, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan). Under the Purchase Plan, the Company registered 200,000 shares of common stock for issuance to participating eligible employees. Any employee who had completed ninety (90) days of employment with the Company was eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan. The Company contributed 15% of the cost of the stock purchased. Participating employees had the Company withhold a specified amount (at least $20.00 per month and not exceeding 15% of compensation for that particular month) from their paychecks. The custodian of the Purchase Plan purchased common stock on the open market with participating employees' contributions. In October 2001, the Company suspended employee purchases under the Purchase Plan indefinitely.</P>

</B>
<P>In January 1999, certain principal stockholders of the Company agreed to renew a two-year $4,000,000 letter of credit facility in favor of the Company's credit card processor. As consideration for renewing the letter of credit, the Company agreed to issue up to 800,000&nbsp;warrants to the principal stockholders to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $5.00. In 2001, these warrants were repriced to $0.50 in connection with the VAC Transaction (see Note 4). Upon execution of the letter of credit, the Company issued 160,000 warrants that vested immediately. Accordingly, in </P>

</B>
<P>January 1999, the estimated fair value of the warrants issued of $238,000 was recorded in other assets and is being amortized to expense over the term of the facility. The remaining warrants vested quarterly through January 2001 according to the amount of exposure under such letter of credit, as defined in the agreement. In 2000 and 1999, an additional 320,000 and 237,333 warrants, respectively, vested. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the additional warrants issued in 2000 and 1999, totaling $173,000 and $708,000, respectively, was recorded as deferred debt issuance costs and is being amortized to expense over the remaining term of the facility. The debt issuance costs were fully amortized at December 31, 2000. Each warrant expires five years from the date of issuance.</P>

<P>In February of 2001, these same stockholders of the Company agreed to renew a two-year $4,000,000 letter of credit in favor of the Company's credit card processor. Beginning on June 30, 2001 and at the end of each subsequent quarter, the Company was required to make deposits to reduce the letter of credit by $250,000. As of December 31, 2001, none of these deposits had been remitted. As consideration for renewing the letter of credit, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $1.17. In 2001, these warrants were repriced to $0.50 in connection with the VAC Transaction (see Note 4). Upon execution of the letters of credit, warrants to purchase 800,000 shares, with an estimated fair value of $476,000, vested immediately. Warrants to purchase an additional 2,624,238 shares vested on<BR>
May 15, 2001, with an estimated fair value of approximately $1,561,000. The remaining warrants to purchase 575,762 shares vested on August 15, 2001, with an estimated fair value of approximately $343,000. The fair values, computed using the Black-Scholes pricing model, were recorded in other assets and are being amortized to expense over the term of the facility. The warrants will expire on February 13, 2008.</P>

<P>The Company has provided a valuation reserve of $48,194,895 and $36,287,401 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, to fully reserve for net deferred tax assets in the same amounts due to the uncertainty of their future realization.</P>

<P>As of December 31, 2001, net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $119,000,000 are available to reduce income taxes of future years and will begin to expire in 2010, if unused. The Company made income tax payments of $40,000 and $60,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. No income tax payments were made for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2001. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforward may be subject to certain limitations as a result of changes in ownership of the Company.</P>

<B><P>Aircraft</P>
</B>
<P>From the date of inception through December 31, 2001, the Company has entered into operating lease agreements (collectively, the Lease Agreements) for 19 Boeing 737-200, two Boeing 737-300 Series, and five MD-80 Series aircraft requiring fixed monthly rental payments. Five Boeing 737-200 aircraft were returned upon expiration of their respective lease terms in 2001, 2000, and 1999, and six Boeing 737-200 aircraft were returned prior to the expiration of their respective lease terms in 2001 and 2000. The Company recorded rent expense for aircraft of approximately $19,245,000, $18,339,000, and $14,186,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. During 2001, aircraft rent included related-party rent expense of approximately $5,441,000 related to six aircraft delivered in 2001. There was no related party aircraft rent in 2000 and 1999.</P>

<P>Certain Lease Agreements required the Company to pay the entire cost of the initial overhauls or major repairs, even though a portion of the cycles or flight hours was incurred prior to initiation of the Lease Agreements. Accordingly, at the inception of such leases, the Company accrued (as accrued maintenance) the portion of the estimated cost of the initial overhaul pertaining to cycles or flight hours incurred prior to inception of the lease. The amounts capitalized as aircraft leasehold costs totaled approximately $1,763,000 and $2,396,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Lease agreements commencing in 2001 provide for sufficient reserves to </P>
<B><P>9. Leases (continued)</P>
</B>
<P>fund the first expected maintenance event or require the lessors to pay for any costs of the first overhaul or major repairs in excess of reserves paid to date. As a result, there was no overhaul component capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2001. The capitalized component is being amortized on the straight-line method over five years, the estimated lease terms. Amortization totaled approximately $705,000, $827,000, and $590,000 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.</P>

<P>The Lease Agreements have lease terms ranging between five and six years and generally contain no option to extend the lease term. In December 1999, one lease agreement was modified to extend its lease term through July 2000. </P>

<B><P>Other</P>
</B>
<P>The Company leases facilities as well as office space for its corporate headquarters from local airport authorities. These operating leases have terms ranging from one month to five years. In addition, the Company leases certain aircraft engines, auxiliary power units, certain equipment, and other office space. These operating leases have terms ranging from one to six years. Total rental expense for operating leases other than aircraft charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 was approximately $5,009,000, $4,994,000, and $4,258,000, respectively. Approximately $154,000 of rental expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was attributed to related parties. There was no related party rental expense for 2000 and 1999.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10. Commitments and Contingencies</P>
</B>
<P>In December 2000, the Company signed a letter of intent to lease six Boeing MD-80 series aircraft, with options to lease two additional aircraft, from Pegasus Aviation, a related party. In July 2001, in connection with the VAC Transaction, the Company agreed to lease an additional two Boeing MD-80 series aircraft from Pegasus Aviation. The Company took delivery of five of these aircraft during 2001 and expects to take delivery of the remaining three by the end of 2002. The Company has not exercised its remaining two options.</P>

<P>The Company is party to various legal proceedings and claims which arise during the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11. Federal Grant Assistance Income</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On September 11, 2001, international terrorists hijacked four aircraft (operated by American Airlines and United Airlines) and crashed them into New York City's World Trade Center twin towers and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. This act of war resulted in the closure of the U.S. air traffic system for over two days and has resulted in significantly reduced demand for air travel.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the terrorist attacks, the U.S. Congress approved $15 billion in aid to stabilize the airline industry, including up to $5 billion in direct grants to passenger and cargo airlines to cover losses directly and indirectly resulting from the attacks through the end of December 2001, up to $10 billion in loan guarantees to facilitate the airline industry's access to the capital markets, and war risk insurance for up to 180 days and reimbursements to airlines for certain war risk insurance premium increases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The $5 billion of direct grants has been allocated among U.S. airlines based on their relative size, as measured by available seat miles or cargo ton miles flown during the month of August 2001. The allocation to the Company, which was received in 2001 and recognized as other income, was approximately $7,286,000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the fourth quarter 2001, the Company applied for a loan guarantee from the federal government for financing that the Company is seeking. There can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>12. Aircraft Return and Lease Termination</P>
</B>
<P>During 2001, the Company returned six of its aircraft at or prior to the end of the respective leases. As a result, the Company incurred several charges including the write-off of aircraft leasehold costs associated with these aircraft of approximately $967,000, loss of certain aircraft deposits and other related assets of $450,000, and maintenance expense related to the return of the aircraft of approximately $680,000.</P>

<P>On December 27, 2001, the Company committed to terminate lease agreements relating to two of its aircraft which were taken out of service on January 8, 2002 and February 15, 2002, respectively. The early termination of the leases resulted in several charges including the loss of aircraft deposits of approximately $805,000, early return fees of approximately $800,000, approximately $934,000 in rental fees for the periods the aircraft will be out of service prior to their return dates, approximately $100,000 of maintenance expense related to the return of the aircraft, and $88,000 of other expenses. Approximately $6,000 of the charges have been paid as of December 31, 2001.</P>
<B>
<P>13. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets</I>, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. This new standard, when in effect, will supersede SFAS No. 121, <I>Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for the Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of</I>, providing one accounting model for the review of asset impairment. SFAS No. 144 retains much of the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 121 but removes goodwill from its scope. The Company will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2002 and does not expect a material impact on the financial statements.</P>

<B><P>14. Subsequent Events</P>
</B>
<P>In January 2002, the Company received notice from the bank that processes its bank card sales transactions that they will cease processing the Company's credit card receivables on March 31, 2002, as a result of the bank ceasing this line of business in general. The Company has obtained a nonbinding agreement in principle from a new bank to assume such functions and is in the process of finalizing the agreements with this new bank to </P>

<B><P>14. Subsequent Events (continued)</P>
</B>
<P>complete the transition of processing by March 31, 2002. The proposed terms of the agreement with the new bank are not materially different from the terms of the existing agreement. However, the new bank has advised the Company that they will not accept a surety bond as collateral as did the current credit card processor. Accordingly, the Company must obtain replacement collateral satisfactory to the new processor or the new processor will withhold funds when its exposure exceeds the value of the letters of credit to be provided as collateral. Additionally, the Company must obtain the approval of the old bank and the stockholders providing the existing letters of credit (see Note 7), that such letters of credit may also be used to secure the new bank. There can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained. Inability to replace the bank card sales transaction processing function could cause the Company to cease operations.</P>

<P>In November 2001, the Company signed a letter of intent with debis AirFinance to lease two MD-80 series aircraft. The Company entered into lease agreements and accepted delivery of these aircraft in January and February 2002.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 2002, the Company agreed to return two Boeing 737-200 aircraft to their lessor and expects to complete such returns prior to the end of April 2002. The costs associated with the return of these aircraft, estimated at approximately $800,000, will be recognized in March 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 2002, the Company's Board of Directors has approved a one-for-five reverse stock split, subject to shareholder approval.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 2002, the Company agreed to issue warrants to purchase 3,500,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $0.24782 to its financial advisor as settlement of compensation earned on transactions completed prior to December 31, 2001. This compensation was recorded as an accrued expense of $737,000 in the December 31, 2001 financial statements.</P>

</U><P>Vanguard Airlines, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (hereinafter called the "Company"), hereby certifies that the following resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company as required by Section 242 of the General Corporation Law at a meeting duly called and held on June 8, 2001 and that such resolution was approved in writing by all holders of shares of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of Directors of the Company (hereinafter called the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") in accordance with the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Company (the "Restated Certificate"), the Board of Directors hereby restates the Certificate of Designation for its Series C Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), as follows, subject to approval of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 1.&#9;<U>Designation and Amount</U>. The shares of this series shall be designated as "Series C Preferred Stock" (the "Series C Preferred") and the number of shares constituting the Series C Preferred shall be One Hundred Eighty-Seven Thousand Five Hundred (187,500). Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; <U>provided</U>, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series C Preferred to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Company convertible into Series C Preferred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 2.&#9;<U>Rank</U>. The Series C Preferred shall, with respect to any and all rights and preferences set forth herein, including without limitation, dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution, whether voluntary or involuntary, rank senior to all series of Preferred Stock that may be designated by the Board from time to time other than the Preferred Stock designated as the Series A Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred") and the Preferred Stock designated as the Series B Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred") (together with the Series C Preferred, the "Parity Securities"). The Series C Preferred shall, with respect to any and all rights and preferences set forth herein, including without limitation, dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution, whether voluntary or involuntary, rank equally and <U>pari</U> <U>passu</U> with the Parity Securities and prior to (a) the common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company (the "Comm

All equity securities of the Company to which the Series C Preferred ranks prior, including the Common Stock, are collectively referred to herein as the "Junior Securities."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 3.&#9;<U>Dividend Provisions</U>. Subject to the equal rights of any Parity Securities, the holder of each share of Series C Preferred shall be entitled to receive, out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash, on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date") (rounded to the nearest cent) an amount equal to the product of (a) the number of shares in which each Series C Preferred is then convertible, times (b) the aggregate amount of all cash dividends, and the aggregate (payable in cash, based upon the fair market value at the time the non-cash dividend or other distribution is declared as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) declared (but not w
ithdrawn) during such quarter on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the date upon which shares of Series C Preferred were first issued (the "Initial Series C Issue Date"). No dividends shall be declared or paid by the Company on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise)) unless at such time or prior thereto, the Board of Directors shall have declared and set aside for payment the resulting dividend required by this Section 3.</P>
<P>Dividends shall not be declared on the Series C Preferred unless the dividends applicable to the same period shall be declared on the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.&#9;<U>Liquidation Preferences</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, and subject to the equal rights of any Parity Securities, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of Common Stock and other Junior Securities by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the sum of (i) Twenty Dollars ($20.00) for each outstanding share of Series C Preferred (the "Original Series C Issue Price"), (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of all Liquidation Accretion Amounts that have accrued pursuant to subsection 4(b) with respect to such share of Series C Preferred since the Initial Series C Issue Date, and (iii)&nbsp;an amount equal to declared but unpaid dividends on such share (the sum of the amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) is referred to herein as the "Liquidation Value"). If, upon the occurrence of
 such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series C Preferred shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full Liquidation Value, then, subject to the equal rights of the Parity Securities, the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution to the holders of the Series C Preferred shall be distributed ratably among the holders of shares of Series C Preferred in proportion to the aggregate Liquidation Value that each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Parity Securities shall participate <I>pari passu</I> in any liquidation distribution with each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock participating pro rata based on the amount of such share's liquidation preference at the moment immediately preceding such distribution.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;(i) For purposes of this Section 3, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this Company shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation that results in the transfer of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting power of the Company); or (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii)&#9;In any of such events, if the consideration received by the Company or its stockholders is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall be valued as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(A)&#9;Securities not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (B) below:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1)&#9;If traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2)&#9;If actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3)&#9;If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Company and the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Parity Securities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(B)&#9;The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder's status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (A)(1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Company and the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of the Parity Securities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii)&#9;In the event the requirements of this subsection 4(d) are not complied with, the Company shall forthwith either:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(A)&#9;cause such closing to be postponed until such time as the requirements of this Section 4 have been complied with; or</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(B)&#9;cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Series C Preferred shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice referred to in subsection 4(c)(iv) hereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iv)&#9;The Company shall give each holder of record of Series C Preferred written notice of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholders' meeting called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 4, and the Company shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the Company has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the Company has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of Series C Preferred that are ent
itled to such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Series C Preferred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 5.&#9;<U>Redemption</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>Optional Redemption</U>. The Series C Preferred may be redeemed (subject to (i)&nbsp;the right of any or all shares of Series C Preferred to be converted into Common Stock at any time prior to the Redemption Date (as defined in subsection&nbsp;5(b)), and (ii)&nbsp;subject to the restrictions described in this subsection 5(a) and the legal availability of funds therefor) at any time after June 30, 2001, at the Company's option, in whole or in part, in the manner provided in subsection 6(b), at a redemption price per share of Series C Preferred equal to the Liquidation Value in effect on the Redemption Date. In the event a redemption of less than all of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred pursuant to this subsection 5(a), the Company shall effect such redemption either pro rata according to the number of shares held by each holder of shares of Series C Preferred, or by lot, in each case, as may be determined by the Company in its sole discretion.</P>

In the event that less than all of the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii)&#9;Unless the Company defaults in the payment in full of the applicable redemption price, cash dividends on the shares of Series C Preferred called for redemption shall cease to accrue and accumulate on the Redemption Date, and the holders of such redeemed shares shall cease to have any further rights with respect thereto from and after the Redemption Date, other than the right to receive the redemption price on the Redemption Date, without interest.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 6.&#9;<U>Conversion</U>. The holders of Series C Preferred shall have conversion rights as follows (the "Conversion Rights"):</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>Right to Convert</U>. Each share of Series C Preferred shall be convertible at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the Initial Series C Issue Date, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Series C Preferred, into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Liquidation Value by the Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. The initial Conversion Price (the "Conversion Price") shall be $1.25 per share. Such initial Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. The number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Series C Preferred is convertible is hereinafter referred to as the "Conversion Rate."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>Mechanics of Conversion</U>. Before any holder of Series C Preferred shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Series C Preferred, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that he elects to convert the same, and shall state therein the name or names which he wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. The Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to each holder of Series C Preferred, or to his nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series C Preferred to be converted, and the person or persons enti
tled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>Fractional Shares</U>. No fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of the Series C Preferred. In lieu of the Company issuing any fractional shares to holders upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred, the Company shall pay to such holders an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Conversion Price by the fraction of a share not issued pursuant to the previous sentence.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>Stock Splits and Dividends</U>. In the event the Company should at any time or from time to time after the Initial Series C Issue Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&#9;<U>Combinations</U>. If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Initial Series C Issue Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Series C Preferred shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of Series C Preferred shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f)&#9;<U>Other Distributions</U>. In the event the Company shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Company or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in subsection 6(e), then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 6(f), the holders of the Series C Preferred shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company into which their shares of Series C Preferred are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Company entitled to receive such distribution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(g)&#9;<U>Recapitalizations</U>. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section&nbsp;6 or Section&nbsp;4) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series C Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series C Preferred the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series C Preferred after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of 
the Series C Preferred) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(h)&#9;<U>No Impairment</U>. The Company will not, by amendment of its Restated Certificate or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but it will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all of the provisions of this Section 6 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Series C Preferred against impairment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i)&#9;<U>Certificate as to Adjustments</U>. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred pursuant to this Section 6, the Company, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of such Series C Preferred a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Series C Preferred, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A)&nbsp;such adjustment and readjustment, (B)&nbsp;the Conversion Price at the time in effect, and (C)&nbsp;the number of shares of Common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series C Preferred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(j)&#9;<U>Notices of Record Date</U>. In the event of any taking by the Company of the record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series C Preferred, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date specified herein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(k)&#9;<U>Reservation of Stock</U>. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series C Preferred such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all the then outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred, the Company will take such corporate action as may be necessary, in the opinion of its counsel, to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(l)&#9;<U>Notices</U>. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6 to be given to the holders of shares of Series C Preferred shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his or her address appearing on the books of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 7.&#9;<U>Voting Rights</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;The holder of each share of Series C Preferred shall have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such Series C Preferred could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the Company, and shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote. Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Series C Preferred held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;So long as shares of the Series C Preferred are outstanding, the Company shall not, without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of at least fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, (i)&nbsp;alter or change the rights, preferences, or privileges of the Series C Preferred so as to affect adversely such series of Preferred Stock or (ii)&nbsp;increase the authorized number of shares of Series C Preferred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Designation of Series C Preferred Stock of Vanguard Airlines, Inc. is executed on behalf of the Company this 12th day of July, 2001.</P>

Any failure of Lessee to timely give the notice required hereunder shall not relieve Lessor of its obligation to release monies to Le

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;<U>Payment by Lessor</U>. Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any claims by Lessee for reimbursement from Maintenance Reserves shall be made not later than ninety (90) days after completion of the related work for which reimbursement is sought or upon Lessee's receipt of invoices from any external maintenance provider, whichever is later, but in no event later than six (6) months after completion of the related work and provided that Lessee has notified Lessor in writing that such invoices are in process. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessor shall pay to Lessee, or directly to the repair facility if Lessee so directs Lessor in writing,  within twenty-one (21) days after presentation of an invoice together with supporting evidence reasonably acceptable to Lessor, such as third party bills and work package certified completed, such amounts as are equal to the cost incurred by Lessee and reimbursable to Lessee to the extent permitted hereunder, during the Term of the Lease and claimed by Lessee (together with supporting evidence of the purpose and amount of the expenditure satisfactory to Lessor), in respect of a Major Maintenance Program, including without limitation a Major Maintenance Program undertaken to comply with the requirements set forth in Section 16 and in Exhibit F hereof provided, however, that:</P>

 entitled to reimbursement from the Maintenance Reserves for such Engine for the cost of any maintenance accomplished during such visit to the extent reimbursable to Lessee hereunder and which restores life back to such Engine, and which maintenance would have otherwise been accomplished during the next shop visit, and which would not otherwise have been covered by insurance;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;(3)&#9;if, on any occasion during the Term, the maximum amount available to Lessee in respect of the Airframe, Landing Gear or each Engine, respectively, is insufficient to meet a claim for payment, the shortfall is for the account of Lessee and may not be carried forward or made the subject of any further claim for payment.</P>

Lessee shall provide Lessor with thirty (30) days' prior written notice of each "C" check or portion thereof.  Lessor shall have no duty to make any such inspection and shall not incur any liability or obligation by reason of not making any such inspection.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Maintenance</U> <U>of</U> <U>Corporate</U> <U>Existence</U>.   During the term of this Lease, Lessee will preserve and maintain its corporate existence and such of its rights, privileges, licenses and franchises in any jurisdiction where failure to obtain such licensing or qualification would have a material adverse effect upon Lessee and its business and its ability to perform hereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Maintenance</U> <U>of</U> <U>Status</U>.  Lessee is, and shall remain so long as it shall be the Lessee under this Lease, duly qualified to operate and maintain the Aircraft under Applicable Law and in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(c)&#9;<U>Payment</U> <U>of</U> <U>Taxes</U>.  Lessee will pay or cause to be paid all Taxes (including but not limited to any withholding tax imposed under Applicable Law on Rent payments made to Lessor hereunder, but excluding any sales tax payable in connection with the purchase or sale of the Aircraft by Lessor, or any successor to Lessor) assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it, the Lessor, and the Aircraft and its use and operation (including all landing fees, customs duties, airport fees and the like), arising out of the use and operation of the Aircraft, or upon Lessee's income or profits, or upon any property belonging to it, prior to the date on which the same, if not paid, would give rise to a Lien (other than a Lien permitted by Section 14 hereof) upon the Aircraft, including the Airframe, the Engines or any of the Parts thereof.  Lessee shall promptly pay any and all such Taxes as and when the same are due, and Lessee, on reasonable demand from time 
to time, shall provide written evidence to Lessor that it has paid, or set aside adequate reserves to pay, any Taxes so imposed; provided, however, that Lessee shall have the right, at its own expense, if so permitted by Applicable Law, to contest in good faith the imposition of any and all such Taxes by appropriate procedures and in any reasonable manner that does not impose a material risk of loss, seizure, confiscation or detainment of the Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine or any Part.  Lessee will not be obligated to pay any Taxes measured by the gross annual income or profits of Lessor or Lessor's Lender.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(d)&#9;<U>Place</U> <U>of</U> <U>Business</U>.  Lessee will not, without prior written notice to Lessor, change its principal place of business or chief executive office if there is more than one place of business.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(e)&#9;<U>Notice</U> <U>of</U> <U>Default</U>.  Immediately after Lessee or any of its corporate officers obtains knowledge of a Default or an Event of Default hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement, Lessee shall notify Lessor in writing of such Default.</P>

Lessee further undertakes, at its sole cost and expense, to obtain or effect any new or additional governmental consents, licenses, authorizations, approvals, declarations, filings or registrations of any Governmental Entity as may become necessary for the performance of any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, each Operative Agreement, or any other document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or as is otherwise required by Applicable Law.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Replacement</U> <U>of</U> <U>Parts</U>.  Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will promptly replace or cause to be replaced by the Approved Maintenance Provider, or applicable vendor of the same, all Parts which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever.  In addition, in the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing, Lessee may, at its own cost and expense, cause to be removed any Parts, whether or not worn out, destroyed, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use, provided that Lessee shall immediately replace such Parts, at its own cost and expense.  All replacement Parts shall be free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens permitted by Section 14 hereof, shall be in at least the same modification status and service bulletin accomplishment status, shall be interchangeable as to form, fit and function,
 and subject to Section 16 hereof, shall have been overhauled, repaired and inspected by an FAA approved agency and shall bear FAA acceptable tags, and shall be in as good an operating condition as, and have a value, utility and remaining useful life at least equal to, the Parts replaced (assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition and repair in which they were required to be maintained by the terms hereof) and all historical records relating to such replacement Parts shall be maintained by Lessee in English, and in compliance with the requirements of the FAA.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;All Parts which are at any time removed from the Aircraft shall remain the property of Lessor and subject to this Lease, no matter where located, until such time as such Parts shall be replaced by Parts which have been incorporated or installed in or attached to the Aircraft and which meet the requirements for replacement Parts specified above. Immediately upon any replacement Part becoming incorporated or installed in or attached to the Aircraft as above provided, (i) title to the removed Part shall thereupon vest in Lessee, free and clear of all rights of Lessor, (ii) title to such replacement Part shall thereupon vest solely in Lessor, and (iii) such replacement Part shall become subject to this Lease and be deemed a Part for all purposes hereof to the same extent as the Part which it has replaced.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Alterations,</U> <U>Modifications</U> <U>and</U> <U>Additions</U>.  Lessee, at its own cost and expense, shall make or cause to be made such alterations and modifications in and additions to the Aircraft as may be required from time to time to meet the applicable standards of the FAA, or to comply with any Applicable Law, rule, directive, mandatory bulletin, regulation or order of any Governmental Entity during the Term of this Lease or of the manufacturer of the Aircraft, Engines or Parts (collectively, "Mandatory Orders").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Mandatory Order is issued on or after the Commencement Date which must be terminated during the Term, the actual costs of complying with and otherwise accomplishing any such Mandatory Order shall be paid by and such compliance shall be the sole responsibility of Lessee, provided, however, that if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lessor shall reimburse Lessee for costs incurred by Lessee in terminatin
g any such Mandatory Order in excess of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars (US$150,000.00) under the following formula:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;(X - $150,000)   x   <U>(84 months - Y)</U>  =  Z</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the avoidance of doubt, the above formula for reimbursement to Lessee of costs incurred for the performance of Mandatory Orders shall only apply to the performance of terminating action required by such Mandatory Order and not to inspections required thereby.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessor shall reimburse Lessee for all costs incurred by Lessee in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) in terminating the Mandatory Order designated as AD #2000-11-01 (MPET Insulation Blanket) or as otherwise amended or revised.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In addition, Lessee, at its own cost and expense, and with the advance written consent of Lessor, may from time to time make alterations and modifications in and additions to the Aircraft, provided no such alteration, modification or addition diminishes the remaining warranty, value or utility, or impairs the condition or airworthiness of the Aircraft.  Title to all Parts incorporated or installed in or attached or added to the Aircraft as the result of such alteration, modification or addition shall vest immediately in Lessor and shall become subject to this Lease, without the necessity for any further act or transfer, document or notice, provided, however, that Lessee may remove such Parts prior to return of the Aircraft to Lessor on the Expiration Date if such removal does not damage or otherwise result in any diminution in value of the Aircraft, which value the Aircraft would have had at such time had such alteration, modification or addition not occurred.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 10.&#9;<U>General Tax Indemnity</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Indemnity</U>.  Lessee shall pay when due and indemnify and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and from all Taxes imposed against any such Indemnitee, Lessee, the Aircraft or any interest therein or use thereof, and any and all license, registration and recording fees and assessments, as well as Taxes arising directly or indirectly out of this Lease, and each other Operative Agreement, or based on or measured by, the payments of Rent and other amounts due hereunder or thereunder, the terms, covenants and conditions hereof and thereof, or the use, operation, maintenance, possession, condition, control, occupancy, servicing, installation, transportation, storage, substitution, recording, documentation, import, export, rental, lease, location, repair, abandonment, replacement, delivery, registration, repossession, improvement, subleasing, manufacture, rental, settlement of any insurance claim, return or other disposition of the Aircraft or any Part thereof or int
erest therein regardless of the method of calculation; provided, however, that Lessee shall have no obligation to pay any Taxes assessed by the federal government of the United States, or any state thereof, against the Lessor or any Lessor Lender which are based upon or measured by their respective gross annual incomes or profits.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>Reimbursements to Lessee</U>.  If, by reason of any Tax payment made to or for the account of an Indemnitee by Lessee pursuant to Section 10(a) such Indemnitee subsequently realizes a net tax benefit (whether due to a tax deduction or credit made available to such Indemnitee) not previously taken into account in computing such payment, such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to Lessee an amount equal to the sum of (i) the actual net reduction in Taxes, if any, realized by such Indemnitee which is attributable to such benefit, savings, deduction or credit and (ii) the actual reduction in any Taxes realized by such Indemnitee as the result of any payment made by such Indemnitee pursuant to this sentence; provided, however, that the obligation of such Indemnitee to make any payment pursuant to this Section 10(b) shall be postponed for so long as the amount of such payment pursuant to (i) above would exceed (x) the amount of all prior payments made by Lessee pursuant to Section 10(a) less
 (y) the portion of all prior payments computed pursuant to (i) above by such Indemnitee to the Lessee hereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>Contests</U>.  If a written claim shall be timely made against and timely received by any Indemnitee for any Tax for which Lessee is obligated pursuant to this Section 10(a), such Indemnitee shall notify Lessee in writing promptly of such claim and shall provide Lessee such information regarding such claim as claim as Lessee may reasonably request, but the failure to give such notice or to provide such information shall not diminish Lessee's obligation hereunder unless such failure causes a contest to be precluded or such contest right is materially adversely affected by such failure.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a written claim shall be made for any Tax, for which Lessee is obligated pursuant to Section 10(a), and (x) under applicable law of the taxing jurisdiction Lessee is allowed to directly contest such Tax and, (y) no unindemnified taxes are involved that cannot reasonably be severed from the claim with respect to such Tax, then Lessee shall be permitted, at its expense and in its own name, to contest the imposition of such Tax and (provided that it shall impose no risk of loss, seizure, confiscation or detainment of the Aircraft, the Airframe, the Engine or any part of Lien upon title thereto) to withhold payment during the pending of such contest, if permitted by law.  If allowable under local law and permission is granted to Lessee by Indemnitee, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld, Lessee will be permitted to litigate any Tax claim for which it is obligated to indemnify any Indemnitee provided satisfactory arrangements are concluded which will fully protect such Indemni
tee from a final decision adverse to the interest of Lessee and/or Indemnitee.  If Lessee cannot contest the Tax in its own name, or if Lessee and Indemnitee agree that any contest should be in the name of Indemnitee, then upon request from Lessee within 30 days after receipt of such notice, such Indemnitee shall at Lessee's expense contest the imposition of such Tax.  After considering any views offered by Lessee and Lessee's counsel concerning the forum in which the adjustment is most likely to be favorably resolved, such Indemnitee may in its reasonable discretion select the forum for such contest and determine whether any such contest shall be by (A) resisting payment of such Tax, (B) paying such Tax under protest or (C) paying such Tax and seeking a refund or other repayment thereof, provided, however, if Lessee makes arrangements which fully protect Indemnitee from a final decision adverse to Lessee and/or Indemnitee, Lessee may in its discretion select any forum for such contest and the manner in whic
h it is contested.  Lessee shall indemnify Lessor and Lessor's Lender for any adverse consequences resulting from such choice of forum by Lessee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In no event shall such Indemnitee be required or, shall Lessee be permitted, to contest the imposition of any Tax for which Lessee is obligated pursuant to Section 10(a) unless (P) Lessee shall have agreed to pay such Indemnitee on demand, and indemnify such Indemnitee from, and shall so pay and indemnify on demand of such Indemnitee from time to time, all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses that such Indemnitee incurs in contesting such claim or arising out of or relating to such contest (including, without limitation, all out-of-pocket costs, expenses, losses, reasonable legal and accounting fees, disbursements, penalties, interest and additions to tax); (Q) such Indemnitee shall have reasonably determined that the action to be taken will not result in a sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien (except if Lessee shall have adequately bonded such Lien or otherwise made provision to protect the interests of Lessor in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Lessor) other
 than Liens for Taxes either not yet due or being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings so long as such proceedings do not involve any risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Aircraft, Airframe, any Engine or part or any interest therein; (R) if such contest shall be conducted in a manner requiring the payment of the claim, Lessee shall have advanced sufficient funds, on an interest-free basis, to make the payment required, and agreed to indemnify the Indemnitee against any additional net after-tax cost to such Indemnitee of such advance; (S) in the case of any tax being contested in the name of an Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall have received an opinion of independent tax counsel selected by Lessee and approved by such Indemnitee (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and furnished at Lessee's sole expense to the effect that there is a meritorious basis for contesting such claim; and (T) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall have, at the o
ption of the Indemnitee, either (i) provided security for its obligation hereunder reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee by placing in escrow sufficient funds to cover any such contested Tax or otherwise provided satisfactory provisions for payment or (ii) paid such Tax.  If any Indemnitee shall obtain a refund of all or any part of any Tax paid by Lessee, such Indemnitee shall pay Lessee, but not before Lessee shall have made all payments theretofore due to such Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10(a) an amount equal to the Lessor of (X) the amount of such refund, including interest received attributable thereto, and (Y) such Tax payment by Lessee to such Indemnitee plus any other payment by Lessee to such Indemnitee theretofore made pursuant to Section 10(a).  If any Indemnitee shall have paid the Lessee any refund of all or part of any Tax paid by Lessee and it is subsequently determined that such Indemnitee was not entitled to the refund, such determination shall be treated as the imposition of a Tax fo
r which Lessee is obligated to indemnify such Indemnitee pursuant to the provisions of Section 10(a).  An Indemnitee shall not settle any such claim or contest pursuant to this provision without the written consent of Lessee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nothing contained in this Section 10(c) shall require any Indemnitee to contest or continue a contest of a claim which such Indemnitee would otherwise be required to contest pursuant to this Section 10(c), if such Indemnitee shall waive payment by Lessee of any amount that might otherwise be payable to Lessee under this Section 10 in connection with such claim.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event an Indemnitee contests any Taxes hereunder, the Indemnitee shall apprise Lessee of all material developments with  respect to such contest (provided, however, that a failure to so provide shall not relieve Lessee from its obligations to indemnify hereunder), shall forward copies of all material submissions made in such contest, shall consider in good faith any request concerning the conduct of any such contest and, without waiving the right to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such claim, shall not settle or concede any such contest without the prior written consent of Lessee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>Forms</U>.  Each Indemnitee agrees to promptly furnish from time to time to Lessee or to such other person as Lessee may designate, at Lessee's request and expense, such duly executed and properly completed forms as may be necessary or appropriate in order to claim any reduction, or exemption from any Tax which Lessee may be required to indemnify against hereunder, but only if such Indemnitee may truthfully complete such form and such action shall note have a material adverse effect on such Indemnitee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&#9;<U>Reimbursements by Indemnitees Generally</U>.  If, for any reason, Lessee is required to make any payment with respect to any Taxes imposed on any Indemnitee in respect to the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements or on the Aircraft, the Airframe, the Engines, the Parts or any part thereof, which Taxes are not the responsibility of Lessee under this Section 10 or otherwise under the Operative Agreements, then such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to Lessee on the written demand of Lessee an amount which equals any amounts paid by Lessee with respect to such Taxes, plus accrued interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date of such demand.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f)&#9;<U>Verification</U>.  At Lessee's request, the amount of any indemnity payment by Lessee pursuant to this Section 10 or any payment by an Indemnitee to Lessee pursuant to this Section 10 in excess of $100,000 shall be verified by a firm of independent accountants mutually acceptable to Lessee and Indemnitee, who shall be asked to verify, after consulting with such Indemnitee, whether such Indemnitee's computations are correct and to report its conclusions to both Lessee and such Indemnitee.  Each Indemnitee and Lessee hereby agrees to provide the accounts with all information and materials as shall be reasonably necessary or desirable in connection herewith.  The fees and disbursements of such accounting firm shall be paid by Lessee unless such verification shall result in an adjustment in Lessee's favor greater than or equal to the greater of (i) 10% of the total amount verified, (ii) $25,000, or (iii) the fee charged by such accounting firm, in which case such fees and disbursemen
ts shall be paid by  the appropriate Indemnitee.  Any information provided to such accountants by Lessee or an Indemnitee shall be and remain the exclusive property of Lessee or such Indemnitee, as the case may be, and shall be deem by the parties to be (and the accountants will confirm in writing that they will treat such information as) the private, proprietary an confidential property of such Lessee or Indemnitee, as the case may be, and no person other than Lessee or such Indemnitee and the accountants shall be entitled thereto, and all such materials shall be returned to Lessee or such Indemnitee, as the case may be.  Such accounting firm shall be requested to make its determination within thirty (30) days.  In the event such accounting firm shall determine that such computations are incorrect, then such firm shall determine what it believes to be the correct computations.  The computations of the accounting firm shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Lessee and such Indemnitee, and Lessee shall ha
ve no right to inspect the books, records, tax returns or other documents of or relating to such Indemnitee to verify such computations or for any other purpose.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(g)&#9;<U>Miscellaneous</U>.  In case any report or return is required to be made with respect to any Taxes which are an obligation of Lessee under this Section 10, Lessee will either make such report or return in such manner as will show the ownership of the Aircraft in Lessor and send a copy of such report or return to Lessor or will notify Lessor of such requirement and make such report or return in such manner as shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lessor.  If actual notice is given by any taxing authority to Lessor that a report or return is required to be filed with respect to any such Taxes referred to in this Section 10, Lessor shall promptly notify Lessee of such required report or return.  Lessor agrees to respond to any reasonable request of Lessee for information within the control of Lessor with respect to the filing of any report or return, but Lessee agrees to pay any reasonable costs, fees or other charges of independent counsel or independent accountants incurred in co

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Lessee's obligations under this Section 10 shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which Lessee may have against Lessor or any other Person for any reason whatsoever. Lessee will pay to an Indemnitee, on demand, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, interest at the Interest Rate on any amount not paid when due pursuant to this Section 10 until the same shall be paid in full. All indemnities, obligations, adjustments and payments provided for in this Section 10 shall survive, and remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding the expiration or other termination of this Lease.  The obligations of Lessee in respect of all such indemnities, obligations, adjustments and payments are expressly made for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, an Indemnitee, without declaring this Lease to be in default or taking other action thereunder, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
 contained herein.</P>

Lessee further agrees that if at any time any Applicable Law or any Governmental Entity requires any deduction or withholding in respect of Taxes from any payment of Rent or other amounts due under this Lease or under any other Operative Agreement, the sum due from the Lessee in respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after paying such Taxes or making such deductions or withholding, the Lessor or other Person entitled to the same, receives on the due date for such payment a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required to be made.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Casualty Occurrence with respect to the Airframe</U>.  Immediately after a Casualty Occurrence with respect to the Airframe, Lessee shall give Lessor written notice of such occurrence.  On or before ninety (90) days after the date of the Casualty Occurrence, or upon receipt of insurance proceeds in an amount equal to the Casualty Value, whichever is sooner, Lessee shall pay to Lessor in immediately available funds the Casualty Value.  Upon such payment, and the payment of all other amounts then due and payable under this Lease: (i) the obligation of Lessee to make further payments of Basic Rent hereunder shall terminate, (ii) this Lease shall terminate with respect to the Aircraft, and (iii) Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty, all of Lessor's right, title and interest, in and to the Airframe and Engines (if any) suffering the Casualty Occurrence, free and clear of Lessor's Liens, as well as all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to any Engi

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Casualty Occurrence with respect to an Engine</U>.  Upon a Casualty Occurrence with respect to an Engine only, Lessee shall give Lessor prompt written notice thereof and shall, within sixty (60) days, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the date of such Casualty Occurrence, convey to Lessor, as replacement for the Engine suffering a Casualty Occurrence, title to a Replacement Engine.  Each Replacement Engine shall be free of all Liens (except those Liens which are permitted by Section 14 hereof), shall be the same or better make and model, and shall be in as good an operating condition as the Engine being replaced, assuming the Engine being replaced was in the condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the Casualty Occurrence.  Upon full compliance by Lessee with the terms of this paragraph, Lessor will transfer to Lessee title to the Engine which suffered the Casualty Occurrence.  Prior to or at the time of any such conveyance, Lesse
e, at its own expense, will promptly: (i) furnish Lessor with a full warranty bill of sale, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor, with respect to such Replacement Engine; (ii) cause a further Lease Supplement hereto, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor, subjecting such Replacement Engine to this Lease, to be duly executed by Lessee, and recorded pursuant to Applicable Law; (iii) furnish Lessor with such evidence of title to such Replacement Engine and of compliance with the insurance provisions of Section 12 hereof with respect to such Replacement Engine as Lessor may reasonably request; (iv) furnish Lessor with an opinion of Lessee's counsel acceptable to Lessor and any Lessor Lender to the effect that title to such Replacement Engine has been duly conveyed to Lessor, free and clear of all Liens, that such Replacement Engine is duly leased hereunder and that such Replacement Engine is duly subjected to the Operative Agreements and the Lien of the Lessor Lender's mortga

Upon full compliance by Lessee with the terms of this Section 11(b), Lessor will transfer to Lessee all of the right, title and interest in the Engine, free and clear of Lessor's Liens, which suffered the Casualty Occurrence and which was originally leased to Lessee. For all purposes hereof, each such Replacement Engine shall be deemed part of the property leased hereunder, shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein and shall be deemed part of the Aircraft.  No Casualty Occurrence cover

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(c)&#9;<U>Application of Proceeds and Payments</U>.  Any payments received at any time by Lessor or by Lessee from any insurer under insurance (other than Excluded Payments), or from any Governmental Entity or other Person with respect to a Casualty Occurrence will be applied as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;unless clause 11(c)(ii) below is applicable, so much of such payments as shall not exceed the Casualty Value required to be paid by Lessee pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Lease shall be paid to or as directed by Lessor in reduction of Lessee's obligation to pay such Casualty Value if not already paid by Lessee, or, if already paid by Lessee (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) shall be applied by Lessor to reimburse Lessee for its payment of such Casualty Value and the balance of such payment, if any, remaining thereafter, if such payment is received with respect to insurance other than liability insurance (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) shall be paid over to, or retained by Lessee; or</P>

All payments received by Lessor or Lessee from the Governmental Entity for the use of the Airframe or such Engine during the Term therefor shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and all payments received by Lessor or Lessee from the Governmental Entity for the use of such item after the Term therefor shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(e)&#9;<U>Other Applications</U>.  Any amounts not payable to or retained by Lessee pursuant to this Section 11 or Section 12 hereof because a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall be paid to Lessor until such Default or Event of Default shall cease to be continuing, except that if Lessor shall have theretofore declared this Lease to be in default pursuant to Section 18 hereof, such amounts shall be retained by Lessor and disposed of in accordance with the provisions thereof.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance</U>.  Lessee will carry and maintain in effect, at its own cost and expense, with Approved Insurers, comprehensive airline public liability insurance (including, without limitation, contractual liability to cover Lessee's obligations under Section 13 of this Lease, and passenger legal liability, but only to the extent of the terms and conditions of the policy), and property damage insurance with respect to the Aircraft.  Such insurance shall be in an amount not less than the amount applicable to similar passenger aircraft and engines which comprise Lessee's fleet, shall be of the type usual and customary by U.S. airline standards for U.S. carriers operating other similar aircraft in similar operations and carried by Lessee on the other aircraft in Lessee's fleet and shall at all times be in amounts not less than Three Hundred Fifty Million Dollars (US$350,000,000.00), per occurrence, with zero deductible.  Lessee shall not discri

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Insurance Against Loss or Damage</U>.  Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will maintain in effect with Approved Insurers "all-risk" ground and flight aircraft hull insurance (which shall include, but not be limited to, war risk and allied perils, hijacking, and coverage against strikes, riots, commotions or labor disturbances, malicious acts or acts of sabotage and unlawful seizure or wrongful exercise of control of the Aircraft in flight by a person on board such Aircraft acting without the consent of Lessee, and foreign object damage (defined as sudden and unexpected impact with a foreign object requiring immediate withdrawal of the Engine from service) to Engines) covering such Aircraft, and fire, transit and extended and "all-risk" coverage insurance with respect to Engines and Parts while not installed on such Aircraft or an aircraft, which in each case is at least as broad as coverage of the type usual and customary by U.S. airline standards for airline carriers opera
ting other similar aircraft in similar operations and carried by Lessee on the other aircraft in Lessee's fleet.  Such insurance shall be for an amount not less than the Casualty Value.  Such insurance shall include provisions for deductibles in an amount of not more than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$500,000.00).  No deductible shall apply in the event of a Casualty Occurrence.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(c)&#9;<U>Required Policy Designations and Provisions</U>.  Each policy of insurance obtained and maintained pursuant to this Section, and each policy obtained in substitution or replacement for any such policies, shall:  (i) designate Lessor as owner of the Aircraft covered thereby, and shall designate the Indemnitees as additional named insureds, and the Lessor and/or the Lessor Lender as loss payee, as their interests may appear (but without imposing upon the Indemnitees any obligation imposed upon the insured, including, without limitation, the liability to pay any premiums for any such policies); (ii) expressly provide that, in respect of the interests of the Indemnitees in such policies, the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of Lessee, and shall insure the Indemnitees regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained in such policies by Lessee; (iii) provide that if such insurance is canceled by the Approved Insur

l be payable directly to Lessor as the sole loss payee, for the account of all interests, except as otherwise set forth in subparagraph 12(e) hereof.  Each such policy shall be primary without right of contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by the Indemnitees.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Lessee shall have the right to carry insurance in excess of the amounts required hereunder and the proceeds of such excess insurance shall be payable to Lessee.  Similarly, the Indemnitees shall have the right to carry additional and separate insurance for their own benefit at their own expense, without, however, thereby limiting Lessee's obligations under this Section 12.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(d)&#9;<U>Application of Insurance Proceeds for a Casualty Occurrence</U>.  It is agreed that insurance payments which arise from insurance obtained hereunder and received as the result of the occurrence of a Casualty Occurrence shall be applied in accordance with Section 11(c) hereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(e)&#9;<U>Application of Insurance Proceeds for Other than a Casualty Occurrence</U>.  The insurance payments for any property damage loss to the Airframe or any Engine not constituting a Casualty Occurrence, or to any Part, shall be paid to Lessor, and thereafter be applied by Lessor in payment for the repairs or for replacement property Lessee is required to perform or that Lessee must obtain in accordance with the terms of Sections 9 or 11 of this Lease, or, if such repair or replacement has already been paid for by the Lessee, to promptly reimburse Lessee for such repairs or replacements, and any balance remaining after compliance with such sections with respect to such loss shall be applied, in the sole discretion of Lessor, towards any amounts due and owing to Lessor hereunder by Lessee, provided, however, that if no Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, the first One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) of insurance payments for any property damage loss to th

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(f)&#9;<U>Application in Default</U>.  Any amount referred to in Section 11(c) or Section 12(e) hereof which is otherwise payable to Lessee shall not be paid to Lessee, or, if it has been previously paid to Lessee, and not yet applied by Lessee as permitted or required hereunder, shall be immediately delivered by Lessee to Lessor, if at the time of such payment, an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.  In either case, all such amounts shall be held by Lessor as security for the obligations of Lessee, or, at the option of Lessor, applied by Lessor toward payment of any of Lessee's obligations at the time due hereunder.  At such time as there shall not be continuing any such Event of Default, all such amounts at the time held by Lessor in excess of the amount, if any, which Lessor has elected for application as provided above, shall be paid to Lessee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(g)&#9;<U>Certificates of Insurance</U>.

Lessee will instruct such Approved Insurance Broker who is authorized by an Approved Insurer to agree to advise Lessor in writing or by telex: (i) at least thirty (30) days (seven (7) days in the case of any war risk and allied perils coverage or such lesser period of time as may be customarily applicable) prior to the termination or cancellation by the underwriters for any reason (including, without limitation, failure to pay the premium therefor) of any such insurance; and (ii) a

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(h)&#9;<U>Reinsurance</U>.  If the Aircraft is ever registered outside the United States, or otherwise insured outside of the United States, then all of the insurances required hereunder are to be reinsured and such reinsurance shall contain a "cut-through" clause reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and each Lessor's Lender, and Lessee will furnish to Lessor and Lessor's Lender a certificate and a letter of undertaking executed and delivered by an Approved Insurance Broker who is authorized by an Approved Insurer, describing in reasonable detail the reinsurance carried on the Aircraft and certifying that the reinsurance then maintained on the Aircraft complies with the terms of this Lease.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(i)&#9;<U>Y2K Exclusions</U>.&#9;Lessee shall secure coverage in respect of all of the foregoing insurances under AVN 2001 and AVN 2002 so as to insure against any applicable exclusions from coverage under AVN 2000, in each case to be confirmed by certificates to be delivered under subparagraph 12(g) above.</P>

In the event Lessee is required to indemnify any Indemnitee hereunder, Lessee shall pay to such Indemnitee an amount which, after deduction of all Taxes and like charges required to be paid by such Indemnitee in respect of such payment, is equal to the amount of the indemnification required, provided, however, that all of the provisions of Section 10 hereof shall apply to such payment; and provided further, however, that Lessee shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnitee against Claims arising out of any one or more of the following: (1) such Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct; (2) any representation or warranty by such Indemnitee in the Operative Agreements being incorrect; (3) the failure by such Indemnitee to perform or observe in any material respect any agreement, covenant or condition in any of the Operative Agreements, inc

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a claim is made against an Indemnitee involving one or more Claims and such Indemnitee has notice thereof, such Indemnitee shall promptly after receiving such notice give notice of such claim to Lessee; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release Lessee from any of its obligations to indemnify hereunder.

Notwithstanding  any of the foregoing to the contrary, Lessee shall not be entitled to assume responsibility for and control of any such judicial or administrative proceedings, (i) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or (ii) if such proceedings will involve a material risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on the Aircraft or any part thereof, unless in such an event Lessee shall have posted a bond or other security reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Indemnitees in respect to such risk.  An Indemnitee may participate at its own expense and with its own counsel in any jud

The Lessee shall supply any Indemnitee with such information reasonably requested by such Indemnitee as is necessary or advisable for each Indemnitee to control or participate in any proceeding to the extent permitted by this Section 13.

At such time as the Aircraft has been inspected by Lessor and found to be in the condition required hereunder, Lessor shall issue a redelivery receipt to Lessee confirming the same. Any engines installed on the Aircraft returned to Lessor hereunder which had not originally been installed on the Aircraft will be deemed to be part of the Aircraft and owned by Lessor, and Lessor shall, subject to such engines fulfilling all requirements of a Replacement Engine under
 Section 11(b) hereof, and otherwise complying with all requirements of Exhibit F hereto, relinquish title to any Engines previously removed and replaced by such last-installed engines.

 shall be no substitution of an engine for an Engine such that the time and cycles remaining on any Replacement Engine is less than the time and cycles that were remaining on the replaced Engine based upon actual hours / cycles operated by Lessee.

All storage expenses attributable to any extension of the Term pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be payable by Lessee, and Lessee shall continue to insure the Aircraft in accordance with Section 12 during any such extension period. Lessor shall work diligently in its inspection of the Aircraft.</P>

Any direct expense incurred by Lessor for such correction shall become Supplemental Rent payable by 
Lessee within thirty (30) days following the submission of a written statement by Lessor to Lessee, identifying the items corrected and setting forth the expense of such correction.  Lessee's obligation to pay such Supplemental Rent shall survive the passage of the Expiration Date or other termination of this Lease.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(g)&#9;<U>Brokers</U>.  Each party agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, damages, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees) asserted by any agent, broker or other third party for any commission or compensation of any nature whatsoever based upon the lease of the Aircraft, if such claim, damage, cost or expense arises out of any action or alleged action by the indemnifying party, its employees or agents.</P>

Upon return of each Engine, Lessee shall compensate Lessor for any hours consumed by Lessee since the last Engine Shop Visit occurring prior to the Redelivery Date, based on the Engine performance restoration portion of the Maintenance Reserve rate, which is $90/hour.  Lessee will be permitted to draw upon funds in the applicable Maintenance Reserve account to compensate Lessor. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;f)&#9;Each landing gear shall have the same number of hours and cycles and days  remaining until the next scheduled overhaul as it had on the Commencement Date. Lessee may return each landing gear with less time remaining to the next scheduled overhaul than on the Commencement Date provided that Lessee compensate Lessor for the difference between the time remaining until the next scheduled overhaul at the Expiration Date, and the time remaining until the next scheduled overhaul at the Commencement Date.  Each landing gear shall have no more time since last overhaul than the time that has elapsed on the Aircraft since the Commencement Date.  The formula for calculating such compensation shall be the industry average cost to overhaul such landing gear, divided by the overhaul interval and then multiplied by the numbers of hours which is less than was delivered to Lessee.  Lessee will be permitted in draw upon funds in the applicable Maintenance Reserve account to compensate Lessor.  If L
essee returns such Landing Gear with more time remaining until the next due overhaul than was the case at delivery to Lessee, then Lessor shall compensate Lessee per the above described calculation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8(f) of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 8(f), deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party will have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party will have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party repres
ented by such counsel in such proceeding.  The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced thereby, will relieve such indemnifying party of liability, but only to the extent that such indemnifying party is prejudiced with respect to a specific claim.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder or underwriter, or any person controlling such Holder or underwriter, from whom the person asserting any losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Registrable Shares, if a copy of the prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) provided by the Company was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Holder or underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the purchased Registrable Shares to such person, and if the prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>If the indemnification provided for in Sections 8(f)(i) or 8(f)(ii) hereof shall be unavailable to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any liability under the 1933 Act, then, and in each such case, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statement or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to infor
mation supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided that in no event shall any contribution under this subsection (v) by any Holder exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by such indemnifying party.  No person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section II(f) of the 1933 Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 8(f) will survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Shares in a registration statement, and otherwise.</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P>This Employment Contract dated as of November 14, 2001, is entered into by and between Vanguard Airlines, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Vanguard") and ____________________________ ("Officer").</P>

<P>This Employment Contract sets forth the terms under which Officer continues employment with Vanguard.    This contract supplements the terms of Officer's existing employment with Vanguard.</P>

<P>In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:</P>

<P>1.  <U>Employment</U>  The Company agrees to employ Officer, and Officer agrees to remain in the employ of the Company, under the following terms and conditions.</P>

<P>2.  <U>Position</U>  At the time of execution of this contract, Officer shall have the position of ____________________________.  Such position may be changed at the discretion of Vanguard's Board of Directors, subject to the terms of this agreement.</P>

<P>3.  <U>Term</U>  Officer's employment shall be at will.  Either the Company or Officer shall have the right and ability to terminate the relationship at any time, with or without cause, and without any liability except as expressly set forth herein or in any letter granting stock options to Officer, and provided, that, absent cause, Officer shall provide Vanguard at least two weeks notice of any termination of employment by Officer.</P>

<P>4. <U>Compensation</U>  Vanguard shall pay Officer a base salary at an initial rate of per year, payable in substantially equal biweekly installments (or on such regular payroll schedule as the Company may establish from time to time).  Such compensation may be increased from time to time.  As used herein, "Base Salary" refers to the amount Officer is being paid as of a termination of his employment with Vanguard, without regard to bonus or any other form of incentive compensation or any voluntary salary reduction agreements.</P>

<P>5.  <U>Termination of Employment</U>  A "Termination of Employment" shall be defined as any one of the following:</P>

<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>the termination of Officer's employment by Vanguard for any reason other than (i) willful misconduct or gross neglect of duty by Officer, (ii) retirement at or following Officer's attainment of age 65, (iii) death of Officer;</LI>
<LI>a reduction of Officer's cash compensation by more than 15% below the highest level of cash compensation from time to time in effect for Officer (provided, that the voluntary 25% salary deferral through October 31, 2001 shall not be considered a Termination of Employment); or</LI>
<LI>a termination of Officer's employment by Officer within two years following a Change in Control (as defined below) as a result of either (i) a relocation of the Officer's place of employment that results in a hardship to the Officer or (ii) a material reduction in the responsibilities, authority or title of Officer.</LI></OL>

<LI>In the event Officer has been employed with Vanguard (as an officer) for at least three years, for the lifetime of the Officer.</LI></OL>


<P>During the Severance Period, pass travel shall be at the same priority as during Officer's employment.  Following the Severance Period, Officer and spouse shall be entitled to the same boarding priority as during Officer's employment; all other pass-eligible dependents shall be at an SA-3 priority, based on the Officer's original date of hire (or its equivalent).  The number of round trips taken by Officer and his pass-eligible dependents on a positive space basis shall not exceed 30 per year.</P>

<P>Buddy passes shall expire as of the date an Officer's employment terminates.</P>

<P>7.  <U>Stock Options</U>  Notwithstanding any more restrictive language in any stock option grant letter, but subject to the terms of any stock option plan under which such options are granted, upon a Termination of Employment, all options previously granted to Officer shall become immediately vested and exercisable, and shall remain exercisable for a period of six (6) months following the Termination of Employment.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>8.  <U>Officer Obligations</U>  As a condition to Officer's entitlement to the benefits set forth herein, during the Severance Period:</P>

<OL TYPE="a">

<P>9.  <U>Change in Control</U>  A &quot;Change in Control&quot; shall be deemed to occur upon the Company's execution of an agreement or a term sheet (regardless of whether Board of Directors approval has been obtained) providing for a company or other person (other than Richard Wiley, William Hambrecht or Ed Shea or any entities controlled by them) to obtain 35% or more of the voting interests in Vanguard (or to otherwise exercise effective control of Vanguard).</P>

<P>10.  <U>Miscellaneous</U>  </P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>a)&#9;This agreement shall be binding on any successors or assigns of Vanguard, including any company with which Vanguard may merge or to which Vanguard sells or transfers all or substantially all its assets.  </P>
<P>b)&#9;Written notices furnished under this agreement shall be sent to the Officer at his last address reported to Vanguard and, if to Vanguard, to</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Purchase and Sale of Units</U>.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company will issue and sell to each Investor, and each Investor will purchase from the Company, at the Closing (as defined below) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, $.001 par value, (the "Preferred Stock") set forth opposite each Investor's name on <U>Exhibit A</U> at a purchase price equal to Twenty Dollars ($20.00) per share.  The Preferred Stock shall have the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions set forth in the Certificate of Designation attached hereto as <U>Exhibit B</U> (the &quot;Certificate of Designation&quot;).</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Closing</U>.  The closing of the purchase and sale of the Preferred Stock shall take place at 2:00 p.m. on or about March 9, 2001, or at such other date and time as the Investors and the Company shall mutually agree upon (which date and time are designated as the &quot;Closing&quot;).

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Delivery</U>.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company shall deliver to each Investor a stock certificate representing the Shares to be purchased by such Investor against payment of the purchase price therefor by cancellation of the principal amount of any indebtedness (with accrued and unpaid interest on any such indebtedness being paid by the Company within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date), a check payable to the order of the Company, or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account of the Company.  <B> </B>In the event that payment by an Investor is made, in whole or in part, by cancellation of indebtedness, then such Investor shall surrender to the Company for cancellation at the Closing any evidence of such indebtedness or shall execute an instrument of cancellation in form and substance acceptable to the Company.  </LI></P></OL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Representations and Warranties of the Company</U>.  The Company hereby represents and warrants to each Investor, that, except as set forth on the Schedule of Exceptions attached hereto as <U>Exhibit C</U> (the &quot;Schedule of Exceptions&quot;), with any disclosure thereon being deemed disclosure for all purposes and all relevant subsections hereof, which exceptions will be deemed to be representations and warranties as if made hereunder:</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Organization and Good Standing</U>.  The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.  The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to own its assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and presently proposed to be conducted.  The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or leasing of assets, or the conduct of its business, makes such qualification necessary, except where failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial condition of the Company.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Requisite Power and Authorization</U>.  The Company will have all necessary corporate power and authority under the laws of the State of Delaware and all other applicable provisions of law to execute and deliver this Agreement, to issue the Shares, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Shares (the &quot;Conversion Shares&quot;), the Warrants and the Warrant Shares and to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the Warrants.  All corporate action on the part of the Company required for the lawful execution and delivery of this Agreement, and issuance and delivery of the Shares, the Conversion Shares, the Warrants and the Warrant Shares has been duly and effectively taken.  Upon execution and delivery, this Agreement and the Warrants constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforcement may be limited by insolvency and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights g
enerally and equitable remedies.  The Shares and the Warrants (and the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants) when issued in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Warrants, as the case may be, and the Conversion Shares when issued in accordance with the Restated Certificate, will, be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable, and issued in compliance with federal securities laws and the securities laws of the State of California.  No stockholder of the Company or other person has any preemptive right of subscription or purchase or contractual right of first refusal or similar right with respect to the Shares, the Conversion Shares, the Warrants or the Warrant Shares.  The Company has reserved such number of shares of its Common Stock necessary for issuance of the Warrant Shares and the Conversion Shares.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Consents</U>.  No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court, governmental agency or third party is required for the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the performance by the Company of any of its obligations hereunder (including issuance of the Shares and the Warrant Shares) and under the Restated Certificate other than the Stockholder Approval. </LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>SEC Documents</U>.  The Company has timely filed all documents that the Company was required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;SEC&quot;) under Sections 13 or 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;), since December 31, 1996 (collectively, the &quot;SEC Documents&quot;).  As of their respective filing dates, or such later date on which such reports were amended, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;1933 Act&quot;), as applicable.  No SEC Documents as of their respective dates, or such later date on which such reports were amended, or press release, containing information material to the business as a whole, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances 
under which they were made, not misleading.  The financial statements included in the SEC Documents (the &quot;Financial Statements&quot;) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.  Except as may be indicated in the notes to the Financial Statements or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and any subsidiaries at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and consolidated cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring adjustments). </LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Capital Stock</U>.  The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $.001 par value, and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $.001 par value, 600,000 of which have been designated Series A Preferred Stock.  As of January 1, 2001, there were 20,571,862 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, and 302,362 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.  All outstanding shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.  Except for (A) the conversion privileges of the Preferred Stock to be issued under this Agreement, (B) the 2,584,274 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, (C) the 6,410,256 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, (D) 12,538,724 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise o
f the Company's<B> </B>outstanding warrants, (E) 4,677,291 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of stock options granted to employees, consultants, officers or directors of the Company, the Company has no outstanding securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock and no contracts, rights, options or warrants to purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock.  Since December 1, 2000 the Company has not issued any shares of capital stock except for shares set forth on the Schedule of Exceptions.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Compliance with Other Agreements</U>. Neither the execution and delivery of, nor the consummation of any transaction or execution of any instrument contemplated by, this Agreement, nor the issuance of the Shares, the Conversion Shares, the Warrants and the Warrant Shares, has constituted or resulted in, or will constitute or result in, a default under or breach or violation of any term or provision of the Company's Bylaws, Restated Certificate, or contracts with third parties, state or federal laws, rules or regulations, writs, orders or judgments or decrees which are applicable to the Company or its properties.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No Material Adverse Change</U>.  Since the date of the Company's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q or most recent periodic report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC, there has not been:</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="i">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition or operations of the Company from that reflected in the Financial Statements except changes resulting from ongoing operating losses during such period;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any material change, except in the ordinary course of business, in the contingent obligations of the Company whether by way of guarantee, endorsement, indemnity, warranty or otherwise;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, materially and adversely affecting the properties or business of the Company; or</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any declaration or payment of any dividend or other distribution of the assets of the Company.</LI></P></OL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Litigation</U>.  There is no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation before any court, governmental agency or body, or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its affiliates that would materially adversely affect the execution by the Company of, or the performance by the Company of its obligations under, this Agreement.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No Misrepresentation</U>.  No representation or warranty by the Company in this Agreement and no statements in the SEC Documents, as amended, nor any other document, statement, certificate or schedule furnished or to be furnished by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, when taken together with the foregoing, contains or shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or shall omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make such statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The Company has delivered true and complete copies of all documents requested by the Investors.</LI></P></OL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Representations and Warranties of Investors</U>.  Each Investor represents and warrants, severally and not jointly, to the Company that:</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Authorization</U>.  Such Investor has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of such Investor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and equitable remedies, and except as indemnity provisions in the enforcement of Section 4 of this Agreement (relating to registration rights) may be limited by law.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Purchase for Investment</U>.  Such Investor is purchasing the Units for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, a distribution of the Units within the meaning of the 1933 Act.  Such Investor has no present intention of selling or otherwise disposing of all or any portion of the Units.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Access to Information</U>.  Such Investor has had an opportunity to ask questions of the Company's representatives concerning the Company, its present and prospective business, assets, liabilities and financial condition that such Investor has deemed necessary and appropriate as a prudent and knowledgeable investor in evaluating the risks of purchasing the Units.  The foregoing, however, does not limit or modify the representations and warranties of the Company in Section 3 of this Agreement or the rights of the Investors to rely thereon.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Understanding of Risks</U>.  Such Investor is fully aware of:  (i) the highly speculative nature of the investment in the Units; (ii) the financial hazards involved;     (iii) the risk of loss of the investment if the Company is unable to finance its continuing operations; (iv) the lack of liquidity of the Shares, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Shares, the Warrants and the Warrant Shares (collectively, the &quot;Securities&quot;) and the restrictions on the transferability of the Securities (e.g., that such Investor may not be able to sell or dispose of the Securities or use them as collateral for loans); and (v)&nbsp;the tax consequences of investment in the Units.  The foregoing, however, does not limit or modify the representations and warranties of the Company in Section 3 of this Agreement and the rights of the Investors to rely thereon.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Investor's Qualifications</U>.  Such Investor is an &quot;accredited&quot; investor as defined under Regulation D under the 1933 Act.  Such Investor is aware of the general business and financial circumstances of the Company and, by reason of such Investor's business or financial experience, such Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of this investment and is financially capable of bearing a total loss of this investment.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Compliance with Securities Laws</U>.  Such Investor understands and acknowledges that, in reliance upon the representations and warranties made by such Investor herein, the Securities are not being registered with the SEC under the 1933 Act or being qualified under the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, as amended (the &quot;Law&quot;), but instead are being issued under an exemption or exemptions from the registration and qualification requirements of the 1933 Act or the Law or other applicable state securities laws which impose certain restrictions on such Investor's ability to transfer the Shares and the Warrant Shares.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Restrictions on Transfer</U>.  Such Investor understands that such Investor may not transfer any of the Securities unless such Securities are registered under the 1933 Act or pursuant to an exemption from such registration and qualification requirements.  Such Investor understands that only the Company may file a registration statement with the SEC.  Such Investor has also been advised that exemptions from registration and qualification may not be available or may not permit such Investor to transfer all or any of the Securities in the amounts or at the times proposed by such Investor.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Rule 144</U>.  In addition, such Investor has been advised that SEC Rule 144 (&quot;Rule 144&quot;) promulgated under the 1933 Act, which permits certain limited sales of unregistered securities, is not presently available with respect to the Securities solely due to the holding periods required thereunder and, in any event, requires that the Securities be held for a minimum of one year, and in certain cases two years, after they have been purchased and paid for (within the meaning of Rule 144), before they may be resold under Rule 144.  Such Investor understands that Rule 144 may indefinitely restrict transfer of the Securities if such Investor is an &quot;affiliate&quot; of the Company and &quot;current public information&quot; about the Company (as defined in Rule 144) is not publicly available.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders</U>.  Such Investor understands that certificates or other instruments representing any of the Securities acquired by such Investor may bear legends substantially similar to the following, in addition to any other legends required by federal or state laws:</LI></P></OL>

<P>THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE &quot;ACT&quot;), OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE.  THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED, OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT, OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SUCH ACT OR UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to ensure and enforce compliance with the restrictions imposed by applicable law and those referred to in the foregoing legend, or elsewhere herein, the Company may issue appropriate &quot;stop transfer&quot; instructions to its transfer agent, if any, with respect to any certificate or other instrument representing the Securities, or if the Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in the Company's records.  Any legend endorsed on a certificate pursuant to this Subsection (i) and the related stop transfer instructions with respect to such Securities shall be removed, and the Company shall issue a certificate or warrant without such legend to the holder thereof, if such Securities are registered under the 1933 Act and a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the 1933 Act is available, if such legend may be properly removed under the terms of Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act or if such holder provides the Company
 with an opinion of counsel for such holder, reasonably satisfactory to legal counsel for the Company, to the effect that a sale, transfer or assignment of such securities may be made without registration.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Obligations of the Company</U>.  Whenever required to effect the registration of Registrable Securities under this Agreement, the Company will, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="i">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>furnish to the Holders such number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the 1933 Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by them that are included in such registration;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>use its best efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or &quot;blue sky&quot; laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders, provided that the Company will not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter(s) of such offering;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant hereunder to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities registered pursuant hereunder and a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such registration; and</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4, if, at any time during which a prospectus is required to be delivered in connection with the sale of any Registrable Securities, the Company determines in good faith and in its reasonable judgment that such sale would require public disclosure by the Company of material non-public information that the Company deems it advisable not to disclose, or that a development has occurred or a condition exists as a result of which the registration statement or the prospectus filed as a part thereof contains a material misstatement or omission, the Company will immediately notify each Holder thereof by telephone and in writing.  Upon receipt of such notification, Holder and its affiliates will immediately suspend all offers and sales of any Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement.  In such event, the Company will amend or supplement the registration statement as promptly as practicable and will take such other steps as may be 
required to permit sales of the Registrable Securities thereunder by Holder and its affiliates in accordance with applicable federal and state securities laws.  The Company will promptly notify Holder after it has determined in good faith that such sales have become permissible in such manner and will promptly deliver copies of the registration statement and the prospectus (as so amended or supplemented).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to exercise its right to suspend sales of any Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement more than one (1) time in any twelve-month period, (B) the period during which such sales may be suspended (each a &quot;Blackout Period&quot;) shall not exceed thirty (30) calendar days and (C) no Blackout Period may commence less than sixty (60) calendar days after the end of the preceding Blackout Period.  </LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon the commencement of a Blackout Period pursuant to this Section 4, Holder will immediately notify the Company of any contracts to sell any Registrable Securities (each a &quot;Sales Contract&quot;) that Holder or any of its affiliates has entered into prior to notification of the commencement of such Blackout Period and that would require delivery of such Registrable Securities during such Blackout Period, which notice will contain the aggregate sale price and volume of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Sales Contract.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company will immediately notify Holder of its election either (i) to terminate the Blackout Period and, as promptly as practicable, amend or supplement the registration statement or the prospectus filed as a part thereof in order to correct the material misstatement or omission and deliver to Holder copies of such amended or supplemented registration statement and prospectus or (ii) to continue the Blackout Period in accordance wit
h this paragraph.  If the Company elects to continue the Blackout Period, and Holder or any of its affiliates is therefore unable to consummate the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Sales Contract (such unsold Registrable Securities being hereinafter referred to herein as the &quot;Unsold Securities&quot;), the Company will promptly indemnify each Holder against any loss, claim or damage that each Holder may incur arising out of or in connection with Holder's breach or alleged breach of any such Sales Contract, and the Company shall reimburse each Holder for any reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred by such party in investigating or defending any such proceeding (collectively, the &quot;Indemnification Amount&quot;); provided, however, that each Holder shall take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to mitigate such Indemnification Amount; and provided further, however, that as long as current prospectus is delivered to such Holder within one day of t
he end of the Blackout Period, the Indemnification Amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to the number of Unsold Securities multiplied by the difference between (x) the actual per share price received by Holder or any of its affiliates upon the sale of the Unsold Securities (if such sale occurs within three (3) trading days of the end of the Blackout Period) or the closing sale price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ or other national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed on the third trading day after the end of the Blackout Period (if the Unsold Securities are not sold by Investor or any of its affiliates within three (3) trading days of the end of the Blackout Period), and (y) the per share sale price for the Unsold Securities provided in the Sales Contract.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Furnish Information</U>.  It will be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to Section 4 hereof that the selling Holders will furnish to the Company such information regarding themselves, the Registrable Securities held by them, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as will be required to effect the registration of their Registrable Securities.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Delay of Registration</U>.  No Holder will have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any registration as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this  <BR>
Section 4.</LI></P>

<OL TYPE="i">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, the partners, shareholders, officers, directors, employees and agents of each Holder, any underwriter (as defined in the 1933 Act) for such Holder and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively, a &quot;Violation&quot;):</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="A">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act, any federal or state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act or any federal or state securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement;</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and the Company will reimburse each such Holder, partner, shareholder, officer, director, employee, agent, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them, as incurred, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 4(f)(i) will not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), nor will the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by such Holder, partner, shareholder, officer, director, underwriter or controlling person 
of such Holder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act, any underwriter and any other Holder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other Holder's partners, directors or officers or shareholders or any person who controls such Holder within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the Company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other such Holder, partner or director, officer, shareholder or controlling person of such other Holder may become subject under the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any
 Violation that arises solely as a result of written information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other Holder, partner, officer, director, shareholder or controlling person of such other Holder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action: provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 4(f)(ii) will not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; and provided further, that the total amounts payable in indemnity by a Holder under this Section 4(f)(ii) in respect of any Violation will not exceed the lesser of (A) the aggregate proceeds (net of discounts) received by 
such Holder upon the sale of the Shares or Warrant Shares and (B) that proportion of aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses indemnified against which equals the proportion which the number of Registrable Securities being sold by such Holder bears to the total number of Securities being sold by the Company and all Holders.  </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 4(f) of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 4(f), deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party will have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party will have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party repres
ented by such counsel in such proceeding.  The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced thereby, will relieve such indemnifying party of liability, but only to the extent that such indemnifying party is prejudiced with respect to a specific claim.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder or underwriter, or any person controlling such Holder or underwriter, from whom the person asserting any losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased shares, if a copy of the prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) provided by the Company was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Holder or underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the purchased shares to such person, and if the prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>If the indemnification provided for in Sections 4(f)(i) or 4(f)(ii) hereof shall be unavailable to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any liability under the 1933 Act, then, and in each such case, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statement or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to infor
mation supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided that in no event shall any contribution under this subsection (v) by any Holder exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by such indemnifying party.  No person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section II(f) of the 1933 Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 4(f) will survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement, and otherwise.</LI></P></OL>
