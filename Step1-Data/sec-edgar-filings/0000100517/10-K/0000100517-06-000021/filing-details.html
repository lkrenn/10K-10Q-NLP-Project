<p><b>ITEM 1.&#160; BUSINESS.</b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>UAL Corporation
(together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "we," "our," "us," "UAL"
or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on December 30, 1968. World headquarters is located at 1200 East Algonquin
Road, Elk Grove Township, Illinois 60007. The mailing address is P.O. Box
66919, Chicago, Illinois 60666 (telephone number (847) 700-4000).
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL is a holding company
whose principal subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc. ("United").&#160;
United's operations, which consist primarily of the transportation of persons,
property, and mail throughout the U.S. and abroad, accounted for most of
UAL's revenues and expenses in 2005.&#160; United provides these services
through full-sized jet aircraft (which we refer to as our "mainline" operations),
as well as smaller aircraft in its regional operations conducted under
contract by "United Express<sup>&#174;</sup>" carriers.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United is one of the largest
passenger airlines in the world with more than 3,600 flights a day to more
than 200 destinations through its mainline and United Express services.
United offers 1,600 average daily mainline (including Ted<sup><font size="-2">(SM)</font></sup>)
departures to more than 120 destinations in 28 countries and two U.S. territories.&#160;
United provides regional service connecting primarily with United's domestic
hubs through marketing relationships with United Express carriers, which
provide more than 2,000 average daily departures to more than 150 destinations.&#160;
United serves virtually every major market around the world, either directly
or through its participation in the Star Alliance<sup>&#174;</sup>, the
world's largest airline network.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160; United offers a portfolio of services that we believe
will allow it to generate a revenue premium by meeting distinct customer
needs. This strategy of market segmentation is intended to optimize margins
and costs by offering the right service to the right customer at the right
time. This portfolio includes:
</p><ul>
<li>
United mainline, including United First<sup>&#174;</sup>, United Business<sup>&#174;</sup>
and Economy Plus<sup>&#174;</sup>, which now offers three to five inches
of extra legroom on all United mainline flights (including Ted), and on
explus<sup><font size="-2">(SM)</font></sup> regional jet flights;</li>
<li>
Ted, a low-fare service, expanded in 2005 from 47 to 56 aircraft serving
19 airports with more than 240 daily departures from all United hubs;</li>
<li>
p.s.<sup><font size="-2"> (SM)</font></sup> - premium transcontinental service
connecting New York with Los Angeles and San Francisco; and</li>
<li>
United Express, which now includes more than 100 aircraft that offer explus,
United's premium regional service, redefining the regional jet experience.</li>
</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company also generates significant
revenue through its Mileage Plus Frequent Flyer Program ("Mileage Plus"),
United Cargo<sup><font size="-2">(SM)</font></sup>, and United Services.
Mileage Plus contributed over $800 million to passenger and other revenue
in 2005 and helps the company attract and retain high-value customers.
United Cargo generated over $700 million in freight and mail revenue in
2005. United Services generated over $275 million in revenue in 2005 by
utilizing downtime of otherwise under-utilized resources.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company believes its
restructuring has made United competitive with network airline peers. In
every year of the restructuring, beginning in 2003, the Company has improved
its financial performance. The Company's 2005 financial results clearly
demonstrate this progress - despite an increase in fuel price of over 40
percent. While the cost of mainline fuel has increased more than $2.0 billion
since 2002, the Company has reduced operating losses by approximately $2.6
billion over the same period.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Throughout the restructuring
process, United employees delivered some of the best operational performance
metrics in the Company's recent history. For example, in 2005, United ranked
number one in fewest denied boardings, number two in Arrival:14, and number
three in fewest mishandled bags among the seven major domestic carriers.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Management is focused on
margin enhancement by delivering continuous improvements to the core business
across its operations, by reducing costs, improving revenue execution,
developing differentiated products and services and realizing revenue premiums.
The Company is building on its core competitive advantages, including strong
brand recognition, its leading loyalty program and broad global network.
The Company intends to continue to drive performance through a corporate
culture of accountability and continuous improvement.

with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including annual reports

</p><p><b><u>Bankruptcy Considerations</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>The following discussion
provides general background information regarding the Company's Chapter
11 cases, and is not intended to be an exhaustive summary. Detailed information
pertaining to its bankruptcy filings may be obtained at <u>www.pd-ual.com</u>.
See also Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On December 9, 2002 (the
"Petition Date"), UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions to reorganize their
businesses under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division (the "Bankruptcy Court"). On October 20, 2005, the Debtors filed
the Debtor's First Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the First Amended Disclosure
Statement for Reorganizing Debtors' Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant
to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Disclosure Statement").
On October 21, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Disclosure Statement.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Commencing on October 27,
2005, the Disclosure Statement, ballots for voting to accept or reject
the proposed plan of reorganization and other solicitation documents were
distributed to all classes of creditors eligible to vote on the proposed
plan of reorganization. On January 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed
the Debtors' Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Plan of Reorganization").
The Plan of Reorganization became effective and the Debtors emerged from
bankruptcy protection on February 1, 2006 (the "Effective Date"). On the
Effective Date, UAL implemented fresh start accounting in accordance with
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position
90-7 "<i>Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code</i>" ("SOP 90-7"). See Note 20, "Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance Sheet
(Unaudited)" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Plan of Reorganization
generally provides for the full payment or reinstatement of allowed administrative
claims, priority claims, and secured claims, and the distribution of new
equity securities to the Debtors' creditors, employees and others in satisfaction
of allowed unsecured claims. The Plan of Reorganization contemplates UAL
issuing up to 125 million shares (out of the one billion shares of new
common stock authorized under its certificate of incorporation). The new
common stock was listed on the NASDAQ National Market and began trading
under the symbol "UAUA" on February 2, 2006. The distributions of common
stock, subject to certain holdbacks as described in the Plan of Reorganization,
will generally be made as follows:
<br/>&#160;
</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Approximately 115 million shares of common stock to unsecured creditors
and employees,</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Up to 9.825 million shares of common stock and options (or rights to acquire
shares) under the management equity incentive plan ("MEIP") approved by
the Bankruptcy Court, and</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Up to 175,000 shares of common stock and options (or rights to acquire
shares) under the director equity incentive plan ("DEIP") approved by the
Bankruptcy Court.</li>

on
the Effective Date, and no distribution will be made to holders of those
securities.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On the Effective Date, the
Company secured access to up to $3.0 billion in exit financing (the "Credit
Facility") which consists of a $2.8 billion term loan and a $200 million
revolving credit line. On the Effective Date, $2.45 billion of the $2.8
billion term loan and the entire revolving credit line was drawn and used
to repay the Debtor-In-Possession credit facility (the "DIP Financing")
and to make other payments required upon exit from bankruptcy, as well
as to provide ongoing liquidity to conduct post-reorganization operations.
Subsequently, the Company repaid $161 million on the revolving credit line
and accessed the remaining $350 million on the term loan. For further details
on the Credit Facility, see Note 9, "Long-term Debt" in the <u>Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Until recently, the Company
had an ongoing dispute with respect to a group of mostly-public financiers
(the "Public Debt Group") involving 14 aircraft financed under the Series
1997-1 Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates ("1997-1 EETC").&#160; In
August 2005, United provided notice to the 1997-1 EETC trustee of its intention
to purchase the Tranche A certificates, which would permit it to secure
long-term access to the 14 aircraft subject to that financing.&#160; The
Company previously had acquired the 1997-1 EETC Tranche B and Tranche C
certificates in a market transaction as a precursor to utilizing the transaction
par buyout mechanism to purchase the Tranche A certificates. However, a
dispute arose between the Company and the holders of the Tranche A certificates
regarding the amount necessary to pay the current certificate holders in
full, and that matter was the subject of litigation.&#160; On March 17,
2006, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Company's settlement
with the Public Debt Group in connection with the 1997-1 EETC transaction.
The settlement resolves all pending litigation in connection with the 1997-1
EETC transaction and aircraft and provides for a permanent mutual release
of all related claims. On March 20, 2006, the Company remitted $281 million
to the 1997-1 EETC trustee as final payment for the Tranche A certificates.
The Company refinanced the 14 aircraft with the $350 million term loan
provided under the Credit Facility.

</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2005, United carried
approximately 67 million mainline revenue passengers and flew approximately
114 billion mainline revenue passenger miles ("RPMs"). United operating
statistics reported in this Form 10-K (which we refer to as "mainline"
operations) do not include the operations of United Express regional carriers,
since these entities are independent carriers who report those operating
statistics separately to the Department of Transportation ("DOT").
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Operating revenues attributed
to United's North America segment were $10.8 billion in 2005, $10.5 billion
in 2004 and $9.9 billion in 2003. Operating revenues attributed to United's
international segments were $5.6 billion in 2005, $5.1 billion in 2004

Sydney and Tokyo. United also provides direct service via its Tokyo hub
to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and Taipei as well as direct service
via Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore, and via Sydney to Melbourne.
In 2005, United's Pacific operations accounted for 18% of operating revenues.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Atlantic</u>.&#160; Washington,
D.C. is United's primary gateway to Europe, serving Amsterdam, Brussels,
Frankfurt, London, Munich, Zurich and Paris. Chicago is United's secondary
gateway to Europe, serving Amsterdam (summer seasonal), Frankfurt, London,
Munich and Paris. United also provides nonstop service between San Francisco
and each of London and Frankfurt; and between London and each of Los Angeles

</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>United Express. </i></b>United
has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide
regional jet and turboprop service branded as United Express. United Express
is a seamless extension of the United product line (United, Ted and p.s.).
SkyWest Airlines, Mesa Airlines, Chautauqua Airlines, Shuttle America,
Trans States Airlines and GoJet Airlines are all United Express carriers,
most of which operate under capacity purchase agreements. The terms of
these agreements require United to pay the regional carriers contractually-agreed
amounts for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement based
on agreed performance metrics. Under these capacity agreements, United
is responsible for all fuel costs incurred. In return, the regional carriers
operate this capacity on schedules determined by United, who also determines
pricing, revenues and inventory levels and assumes the distribution risk
for the available seats.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The capacity agreements which
United has entered into with United Express carriers do not include the
provision of ground handling services. As a result, United sources ground
handling support from a variety of third-party providers as well as by
utilizing internal United resources in some cases.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; While the regional carriers
operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise over 95% of United
Express flying, we also have limited prorate agreements with SkyWest Airlines,
Trans States Airlines and Colgan Airlines. Under these prorate agreements,
United and its prorate partners agree to divide revenue collected from
each passenger according to a formula, while both United and the prorate
partners are individually responsible for their own costs of operations.
Generally, United also collects a program fee from prorate partners to
cover certain marketing and distribution costs such as credit card transaction
fees, global distribution systems ("GDS") transaction fees, and frequent
flyer costs. Unlike capacity purchase agreements, these prorate agreements
require the regional carrier to retain the control and risk of scheduling,
market selection and seat pricing and inventory in its markets.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, United
Express carriers operated 292 aircraft, generating $2.4 billion in operating
revenues and $2.7 billion in operating expenses during 2005. The program
also produced 14 billion available seat miles ("ASMs") and 11 billion RPMs
in 2005.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ted. </i></b>In February
of 2004, United launched Ted in Denver to eight destinations, and by August
2004, 47 Airbus 320s were flying in Ted markets.&#160; In March 2005, United
announced plans to expand its Ted fleet from 47 to 56 aircraft by converting
an additional nine A320 aircraft to the Ted configuration.&#160; The new
Ted aircraft (all in service by mid-December 2005) provide additional service
out of United's hubs in Denver, Washington Dulles, and Chicago O'Hare International
Airport ("O'Hare") to markets in Florida, Mexico and the Caribbean, and
to be flying soon between Phoenix and Los Angeles.&#160; As of December
15, 2005, Ted provides service from all of United's hubs to 12 destinations
in the U.S. and three in Mexico.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>United Cargo.</i> </b>United
Cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through a variety
of services including Small Package Delivery, T.D. Guaranteed, First Freight,
International Freight and Global SP. Freight shipments account for approximately
80% of United Cargo's volumes, with mail accounting for the remainder.
During 2005, United Cargo accounted for 4% of UAL's operating revenues
by generating $729 million in freight and mail revenue, a 4% increase versus
2004. Since United Cargo is not a separate reporting segment, United Cargo
revenues are allocated to the North America, Pacific, Atlantic and Latin
America reporting segments, based upon the actual flown revenue associated
with these segments. The majority of United Cargo revenues are earned in
the international segments of the Company's operations.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United Services.</i></b>United
Services is a global airline support business offering customers comprehensive
solutions for their aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul ("MRO"),
airport and training needs. United Services brings nearly 80 years of experience,
employee talent and the highest level of operational integrity to more
than 150 airline customers worldwide. MRO services account for approximately
three quarters of United Services' revenue with ground handling and flight
training accounting for the remainder. MRO revenue sources include engine
maintenance, maintenance of high tech components including avionics, line
maintenance and landing gear services. During 2005, United Services generated
over $275 million in revenue, a 10% increase as compared to 2004.

<p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>During 2005, United
Express consumed 353 million gallons of fuel costing United approximately
$709 million. This expense is classified as "Regional affiliates" expense
in the <u>Statements of Consolidated Operations</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The price and availability
of jet fuel significantly affect our results of operations. A significant
rise in jet fuel prices was the primary reason that our fuel expense increased
in each of the last two years. The Company expects to be able to offset
some, but not all, of any future fuel expense increases through higher
revenues.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To ensure adequate
supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs, we
arrange to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to our
major hub locations. Although we currently do not anticipate a significant
reduction in the availability of jet fuel, a number of factors make predicting
fuel prices and fuel availability uncertain, including increased world
energy demand due to the improving global economy, geopolitical uncertainties
affecting energy supplies from oil-producing nations, industrial accidents,
threats of terrorism directed at oil supply infrastructure, extreme weather
conditions causing temporary shutdowns of refining capacity, and changes
in relative demand for other petroleum products that may impact the quantity
and price of jet fuel produced from period to period.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Alliances.</i> </b>United
has entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with
other airlines, expanding travel choices for our customers through these
relationships by participating in markets worldwide that United does not
serve directly. These marketing alliances typically include one or more
of the following features: joint frequent flyer program participation;
code sharing of flight operations (whereby selected seats on one carrier's
flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier); coordination
of reservations, ticketing and check-in, baggage handling and flight schedules;
and other resource-sharing activities.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The most significant of these
arrangements is the Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network
co-founded by United in 1997. As of December 31, 2005, Star Alliance carriers
served approximately 790 destinations in over 138 countries with over 15,000
daily flights. Current Star Alliance partners, in addition to United, are
Air Canada, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Asiana, the Austrian Airlines
Group (which includes Austrian Airlines, Lauda Air and Austrian Arrows,
formerly Tyrolean), bmi, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, SAS, Singapore
Airways, Spanair, TAP Portugal, Thai International Airways, US Airways
and Varig.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the first half of 2006,
South African Airways and Swiss International Air Lines will be integrated
into Star Alliance.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United currently also has independent
marketing agreements with other air carriers, including Air China, Air
Dolomiti, Aloha, BWIA West Indies Airways, Continental Connection (operated
by Gulfstream), Fair Inc. dba "ANA Connection," Great Lakes Airlines (a
regional carrier), Island Air, and Virgin Blue.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Mileage Plus.</i> </b>Mileage
Plus builds customer loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent
travelers. Mileage Plus members can earn mileage credit for flights on
United, United Express, Ted, members of the Star Alliance, and certain
other airlines that participate in the program. Miles also can be earned
by purchasing the goods and services of our non-airline partners, such

of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</u>.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Distribution Channels.
</i></b>The
majority of United's airline seat inventory continues to be distributed
through the traditional channels of travel agencies and GDS.The growing
use of alternative distribution systems, including the Company's website
and GDS new entrants, however, provides United with an opportunity to lower
its ticket distribution costs. To encourage customer use of lower-cost
channels and capitalize on these cost-saving opportunities, the Company
will continue to expand the capabilities of its website, www.united.com,
and we guarantee the availability of the lowest prices on united.com.
</p><p><b><u>Industry Conditions</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Seasonality.</i> </b>The
air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. The Company's
operations can be adversely impacted by severe weather and the first and
fourth quarter results normally reflect lower travel demand. Historically,
results of operations are better in the second and third quarters which
reflect higher levels of travel demand.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Domestic Competition.</i></b>The
domestic airline industry is highly competitive and volatile. In domestic
markets, new and existing carriers are free to initiate service between
any two points in the U.S. United's competitors consist primarily of other
airlines, a number of whom are low-cost carriers ("LCCs") with lower-cost
structures than United's, and, to a lesser extent, other forms of transportation.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; About 80 percent of United's
domestic revenue is now exposed to LCCs, which is more than double the
percentage from a decade ago. In January 2006, Southwest Airlines ("Southwest")
initiated new service from Denver, United's second-largest hub, to Chicago
(Midway), Las Vegas and Phoenix. Southwest also began service between Denver
and two more cities, Baltimore and Salt Lake City, in March 2006. United
already competes directly with LCCs in all five of these markets and believes
it is well positioned to compete effectively with Southwest.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In January 2006, Independence
Air ceased operations. In the last year, Independence Air had operated
as many as 600 flights daily to and from Washington Dulles airport, United's
east-coast hub. As a result of Independence Air's cessation of operations,
United expects to benefit from a larger share of Washington-area passenger
traffic and an improved fare environment to and from Washington, D.C. However,
we anticipate that competition from LCCs and other U.S. airlines, including
several large network carriers who are currently restructuring in bankruptcy,
will continue to intensify across the domestic system in the future.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Domestic pricing decisions
are largely affected by the need to meet competition from other U.S. airlines.
Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect
on the Company's financial results because United generally finds it necessary
to match competitors' fares to maintain passenger traffic. Historically,
attempts by United and other network airlines to raise fares have often
failed due to lack of competitive matching by LCCs. Because of different
cost structures, low ticket prices that generate a profit for an LCC have
usually had a negative effect on the Company's financial results. The introduction
of Ted by United in early 2004 was designed to provide United with a lower-cost
operation in selected leisure markets, under which United can be more economically
competitive with its LCC rivals.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>International Competition</i>.
</b>In
United's international networks, the Company competes not only with U.S.
airlines, but also with foreign carriers. Competition on specified international
routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations. See "Industry
Regulation" below. As the U.S. is the largest market for air travel worldwide,
United's ability to generate U.S. originating traffic from its integrated
domestic route systems provides United with an advantage over non-U.S.
carriers. Foreign carriers are prohibited by U.S. law from carrying local
passengers between two points in the U.S. and United experiences comparable
restrictions in foreign countries. In addition, U.S. carriers are often
constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international
gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements or restrictions
imposed unilaterally by foreign governments. To compensate for these structural
limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and
marketing arrangements that allow these carriers to feed traffic to each
other's flights. (see "Alliances" above for further details).
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Insurance.</i> </b>United
carries hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation
industry, in amounts which the Company deems adequate, covering passenger
liability, public liability and damage to United's aircraft and other physical
property. United also maintains other types of insurance such as property,
directors and officers, cargo, automobile and the like, with limits and
deductibles that are standard within the industry. Since the September
11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Company's insurance premiums have increased
significantly. Additionally, after September 11, 2001, commercial insurers
canceled United's liability insurance for losses resulting from war and
associated perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other similar events).
The U.S. government subsequently agreed to provide commercial war-risk
insurance for U.S. based airlines until August 31, 2006 covering losses
to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. The Secretary of
Transportation may extend the policy until December 31, 2006. If the U.S.
government does not extend this coverage beyond August 31, 2006, obtaining
comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially
higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if it is available at all.
See "Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may
adversely impact our operations and financial results" in the <u>Risk Factors</u>.
</p><p><b><u>Industry Regulation</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Domestic Regulation.</i></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b><u>General</u>. All
carriers engaged in air transportation in the United States are subject
to regulation by the DOT. Among its responsibilities, the DOT has authority
to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic
air transportation (no air carrier, unless exempted, may provide air transportation
without a DOT certificate of public convenience and necessity), grants
international route authorities, approves international code share agreements,
regulates methods of competition and enforces certain consumer protection
regulations, such as those dealing with advertising, denied boarding compensation
and baggage liability.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Airlines also are regulated
by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"), a division of the DOT,
primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and other safety
and technical matters. The FAA has authority to issue air carrier operating
certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates, prescribe maintenance
procedures, and regulate pilot and other employee training, among other
responsibilities. From time to time, the FAA issues rules that require
air carriers to take certain actions, such as the inspection or modification
of aircraft and other equipment, that may cause us to incur substantial,
unplanned expenses.&#160; The airline industry is also subject to various
other federal, state and local laws and regulations. The Department of
Homeland Security ("DHS") has jurisdiction over virtually all aspects of
civil aviation security. See "<u>Legislation</u>" below. The Department
of Justice has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. The
U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation
of mail. Labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed
by the Railway Labor Act ("RLA"). We are also subject to inquiries by the
DOT, FAA and other U.S. and international regulatory bodies.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Airport Access</u>. Access
to landing and take-off rights, or "slots," at three major U.S. airports
and many foreign airports served by United are subject to government regulation.
The FAA has designated John F. Kennedy International Airport ("Kennedy")
and LaGuardia Airport ("LaGuardia") in New York and Ronald Reagan Washington
National Airport in Washington, D.C. as "high density traffic airports"
and has limited the number of departure and arrival slots at those airports.
Slot restrictions at O'Hare were eliminated in July 2002 and are slated
to be eliminated at Kennedy and LaGuardia by 2007. From time to time, the
elimination of slot restrictions has impacted our operational performance
and reliability.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To address congestion concerns
and delays at O'Hare, United and American Airlines reached agreement with
the FAA in January 2004 to reduce each of their flight schedules at O'Hare.
We reduced our flight schedule at O'Hare beginning February 2004 between
the peak hours of 1:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. In addition, effective March
2004, we again depeaked our flight schedule by 5%. Subsequently, United,
American Airlines and certain other carriers complied with the FAA's request
to further depeak afternoon operations at O'Hare resulting in a slight
reduction in operations overall beginning in November 2004. In 2005, the
FAA proposed longer-term rules to address congestion at O'Hare until 2008,
which additional capacity is expected to be available at the airport. In
the meantime, the FAA has ordered that the existing operating restrictions
remain in effect until the earlier of October 28, 2006 or the date on which
the long-term rules become effective.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Legislation</u>. The airline
industry is also subject to legislative activity that can have an impact
on operations and costs. Specifically, the law that authorizes federal
taxes and fees assessed on airline tickets expires in September 2007. Congress
is likely to begin the process of reauthorizing these and other aviation
programs in 2006. Past aviation reauthorization bills have touched on a
wide range of areas of interest to the industry, including air traffic
control operations, capacity control issues, airline competition issues,
aircraft and airport technology requirements, safety issues, taxes, fees
and other funding issues.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Additionally, since September
11, 2001, aviation security has been and continues to be a subject of frequent
legislative action, requiring changes to our security processes and increasing
the cost of security procedures for the Company. The Aviation and Transportation
Security Act (the "Aviation Security Act"), enacted in November 2001, has
had wide-ranging effects on our operations. The Aviation Security Act made
the federal government responsible for virtually all aspects of civil aviation
security, creating a new Transportation Security Administration ("TSA"),
which is a part of the DHS pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002.
Under the Aviation Security Act, substantially all security screeners at
airports are now federal employees and significant other aspects of airline
and airport security are now overseen by the TSA. Pursuant to the Aviation
Security Act, funding for airline and airport security is provided in part
by a passenger security fee of $2.50 per flight segment (capped at $10.00
per round trip), which is collected by the air carriers from passengers
and remitted to the government. In addition, air carriers are required
to submit to the government an additional security fee equal to the amount
each air carrier paid for security screening of passengers and property
in 2000. In January 2006, United and a number of U.S. and foreign carriers
were notified by the TSA that a substantial increase in the additional
security fee would be imposed retroactively to the beginning of 2005, and
continuing into 2006 and future years. United, together with many other
affected carriers, is currently disputing this fee assessment. It is expected
that aviation security laws and processes will continue to be under review
and subject to change by the federal government in the future.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>International Regulation.</i></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b> <u>General</u>. International
air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. In connection
with our international services, we are regulated by both the U.S. government
and the governments of the foreign countries we serve. In addition, the
availability of international routes to U.S. carriers is regulated by treaties
and related aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments,
and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT
and/or the relevant foreign governments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Airport Access</u>. Historically,
access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral
agreements between the U.S. and each foreign country involved. These agreements
regulate the number of markets served, the number of carriers allowed to
serve each market, and the frequency of carriers' flights. Since the early
1990s, the U.S. has pursued a policy of "open skies" (meaning all carriers
have access to the destination), under which the U.S. government has negotiated
a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access to foreign
markets. Additionally, all of the airports that United serves in Europe
and Asia maintain slot controls, and many of these are restrictive due
to congestion at these airports. London Heathrow, Frankfurt and Tokyo Narita
are among the most restrictive due to capacity limitations, and United
has significant operations at these locations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Further, our ability to serve
some countries and expand into certain others is limited by the absence
altogether of aviation agreements between the U.S. and the relevant governments.
Shifts in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the
alteration or termination of air service agreements between the U.S. and
other countries. Depending on the nature of the change, the value of our
route authorities may be materially enhanced or diminished.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In November 2005, the U.S.
government and the European Union ("EU") Commission concluded the negotiation
of a transatlantic aviation agreement to replace the existing bilateral
arrangements between the U.S. government and the 25 EU member states. The
EU Council of Transport Ministers must approve the agreement. It is expected
that the Council will vote on the proposed agreement in June 2006. If approved,
the agreement is expected to go into effect in the summer of 2007.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The proposed agreement is
based on the U.S. open skies model and would authorize U.S. airlines to
operate between the United States to any point in the EU and beyond, free
from government restrictions on capacity, frequencies and scheduling and
provides EU carriers with reciprocal rights in these U.S.-EU markets. Currently,
only 15 of the 25 member states have open skies agreements with the United
States. Importantly, the agreement would authorize all U.S. and EU carriers
to operate services between the United States and London Heathrow and,
as a result, the Company and bmi will be able to takes steps to implement
the antitrust immunity the carriers previously received from regulators
on both sides of the Atlantic, but which was suspended pending the opening
of access to Heathrow.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The agreement would also
resolve a legal issue in the existing bilateral agreements between the
U.S. and the EU member states that has resulted in the EU Commission calling
on the EU member states to renounce their air services agreements with
the United States because they allegedly do not comply with U.S. law. To
date, no EU member state has indicated a willingness to renounce its air
services
agreement with the U.S. If EU member states do renounce such agreements,
the status of our existing antitrust immunity with our European partners
would be in doubt because the immunity is based upon an open skies agreement
between the United States and the applicable EU member state.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The EU Commission is expected
to propose important new legislation in the near future that will impact
the Company. The EU Commission is expected to officially sanction secondary
slot trading. This should resolve disputes about the legality of slot exchanges
at EU airports. In addition, the EU Commission will soon propose legislation
to deregulate GDS. We expect GDS deregulation to result in a reduction
in the Company's distribution costs. Finally, the EU Commission is expected
to propose legislation to include aviation within the EU's existing emissions
trading scheme by 2013. Such a measure could add significantly to the costs
of operating in Europe.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; An open skies agreement between
the U.S. and Canada is expected to take effect in September 2006. We anticipate
that an open skies agreement between the U.S. and Canada will permit United
and Air Canada to expand their existing antitrust immunity, which currently
is limited in application to the transborder region.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Environmental Regulation.
</i></b>The
airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local,
and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to
the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water,
and the management of hazardous substances, oils, and waste materials.
Our industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations,
including those that require us to remediate soil or groundwater to meet
certain objectives. Compliance with all environmental laws and regulations
can require significant expenditures. Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as "Superfund")
and similar environmental cleanup laws, generators of waste materials,
and owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for
investigation and remediation costs at facilities that have been identified
as requiring response actions. We also conduct voluntary remediation actions.
Environmental cleanup obligations can arise from, among other circumstances,
the operation of fueling facilities, and primarily involve airport sites.
Future costs associated with these activities are not expected to have
a material adverse affect on our business.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Collective bargaining agreements
("CBAs") are negotiated under the RLA, which governs labor relations in
the air transportation industry, and such agreements typically do not contain

<p><b>ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.</b>
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The following risk factors
should be read carefully when evaluating our business and the forward-looking
statements
contained in this report and other statements we or our representatives
make from time to time. Any of the following risks could materially adversely
affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and
the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are
made in this report.</i>
</p><p><b><u>Risks Related to Our Business</u></b>
</p><p><b><i>Continued periods of historically high fuel costs or significant
disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse
impact on our operating results.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our operating results have
been and continue to be significantly impacted by changes in the availability
or price of aircraft fuel. Previous record-high fuel prices increased substantially
in 2005 as compared with 2004. We at times have not been able to increase
our fares when fuel prices have risen due to the highly competitive nature
of the airline industry, and we may not be able to do so in the future.
Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft
fuel, it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft
fuel. In addition, from time to time we enter into hedging arrangements
to protect against rising fuel costs. Our ability to hedge in the future,
however, may be limited due to market conditions and other factors.
</p><p><b><i>Additional terrorist attacks or the fear of such attacks, even
if not made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect us
and the airline industry.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely
affected our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
prospects for the airline industry generally. Among the effects we experienced
from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption
costs caused by the FAA-imposed temporary grounding of the U.S. airline
industry's fleet, significantly increased security costs and associated
passenger inconvenience, increased insurance costs, substantially higher
ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue
per RPM ("yield").
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Additional terrorist attacks,
even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of or the
precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks (including elevated national
threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights) could
materially and adversely affect us and the airline industry. The war in
Iraq and additional international hostilities could also potentially have
a material adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity and results
of operations. Our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb
the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or an increase in
post-war unrest in Iraq or other international hostilities involving the
United States.
</p><p><b><i>The airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to
price discounting.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The U.S. airline industry
is characterized by substantial price competition, especially in domestic
markets. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources
or lower-cost structures than we do, or both. In recent years, the market
share held by LCCs has increased significantly. For the last several years,
large network carriers like United have generally had a lack of pricing
power in domestic markets.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition, Northwest, Delta
and several small U.S. competitors have recently filed to reorganize under
bankruptcy protection. Other carriers could file for bankruptcy or threaten
to do so to reduce their costs. Carriers operating under bankruptcy protection
can operate in a manner that could be adverse to us and could emerge from
bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors.
</p><p><b><i>Additional security requirements may increase our costs and decrease
our traffic.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Since September 11, 2001,
the DHS and the TSA have implemented numerous security measures that affect
airline operations and costs, and are likely to implement additional measures
in the future. In addition, foreign governments have also begun to institute
additional security measures at foreign airports we serve. A substantial
portion of the costs of these security measures is borne by the airlines
and their passengers, increasing our costs and/or reducing our revenue.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Security measures imposed
by the U.S. and foreign governments after September 11, 2001 have increased
our costs and may adversely affect us and our financial results, and additional
measures taken in the future may result in similar adverse effects.
</p><p><b><i>Extensive government regulation could increase our operating costs
and restrict our ability to conduct our business.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Airlines are subject to extensive
regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant
costs. In addition to the enactment of the Aviation Security Act, laws,
regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from
time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations
or reduce airline revenue. The FAA from time to time also issues directives
and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft
that require significant expenditures by the Company. We expect to continue
incurring expenses to comply with the regulations of the FAA and other
agencies. Additionally, we operate under a certificate of public convenience
and necessity issued by the DOT. If the DOT altered, amended, modified,
suspended or revoked our certificate, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Many aspects of our operations
are also subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws
protecting the environment. Future regulatory developments in the U.S.
and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs
in the airline industry. For example, potential future actions that may
be taken by the U.S. government, foreign governments, or the International
Civil Aviation Organization to limit the emission of greenhouse gases by
the aviation sector are unknown at this time, but the impact to us and
our industry is likely to be adverse and could be significant.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The ability of U.S. carriers
to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable
arrangements between the United States and foreign governments may be amended
from time to time, or because appropriate slots or facilities may not be
made available. We cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations,
or laws or regulations enacted in the future, will not adversely affect
us.
</p><p><b><i>Our results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other
factors associated with the airline industry. Our future financial condition
and results of operations will be further affected by the adoption of fresh
start accounting; and by the future resolution of bankruptcy-related contingencies.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Due to greater demand for
air travel during the summer months, revenue in the airline industry in
the second and third quarters of the year is generally stronger than revenue
in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Our results of operations
generally reflect this seasonality, but have also been impacted by numerous
other factors that are not necessarily seasonal, including among others
excise and similar taxes, extreme or severe weather, air traffic control
delays and general economic conditions. As a result, our quarterly operating
results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire
year, and historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of
future operating results.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result of our bankruptcy
reorganization, we are subject to the adoption of fresh start accounting
as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). As
required by fresh start accounting, our assets and liabilities will be
adjusted to fair value, and certain assets and liabilities not previously
recognized in the Company's financial statements will be recognized under
fresh start accounting. Because we completed our reorganization and adopted
fresh start accounting on February 1, 2006, our reported assets and liabilities
at December 31, 2005 do not yet give effect to the adjustments that will
result from the adoption of fresh start accounting and, as a result, will
change materially. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of
operations from and after the Effective Date will not be comparable to
the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical
consolidated financial statements. For further information about fresh
start accounting, see Note 20, "Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance Sheet - (Unaudited)"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</u>
</p><p>Additionally, despite our exit from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006,
several significant matters remain to be resolved in connection with our
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Unfavorable
resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our
business. For additional detail regarding these matters, see Note 1, "Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11- Bankruptcy Considerations" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p><b><i>Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions
may adversely affect our operations.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Approximately 80% of the
employees of UAL are represented for collective bargaining purposes by
U.S. labor unions. These employees are organized into seven labor groups
represented by seven different unions.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Relations between air carriers
and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under the
RLA, a carrier must maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment
following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy
series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board.
This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement
on a new CBA, or the parties are released to "self-help" by the National
Mediation Board. Although in most circumstances the RLA prohibits strikes,
shortly after release by the National Mediation Board carriers and unions
are free to engage in self-help measures such as strikes and lock-outs.
None of our U.S. labor agreements become amendable until January 1, 2010.&#160;
There is also a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without
union involvement, could engage in illegal slow-downs, work stoppages,
partial work stoppages, sick-outs or other actions short of a full strike
that could individually or collectively harm the operation of the airline
and impair its financial performance.
</p><p><b><i>Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage
may adversely impact our operations and financial results.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums
and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial airlines.
Accordingly, our insurance costs increased significantly and our ability
to continue to obtain certain types of insurance remains uncertain. We
have obtained third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance through a special
program administered by the FAA, resulting in lower premiums than if we
had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market. Should
the government discontinue this coverage, obtaining comparable coverage
from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums
and more restrictive terms, if it is available at all. If we are unable
to obtain adequate war risk insurance, our business could be materially
and adversely affected.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If any of our aircraft were
to be involved in an accident, we could be exposed to significant tort
liability. The insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future
accidents may be inadequate. In the event that our insurance is not adequate,
we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition,
any accident involving an aircraft that we operate could create a public
perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm
our reputation, result in decreased customer traffic and adversely impact
our financial condition and results of operations.
</p><p><b><i>We rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and
any significant failure of these systems could harm our business.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We depend on automated systems
to operate our business, including our computerized airline reservation
systems, our flight operations systems, our telecommunication systems and
our commercial websites, including united.com. Our website and reservation
systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver
important flight information, as well as process critical financial transactions.
Substantial or repeated website, reservations systems or telecommunication
systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services versus
our competitors, and materially impair our ability to market our services
and operate our flights.
</p><p><b><i>Our business relies extensively on third-party providers. Failure
of these parties to perform as expected, or unexpected interruptions in
our relationships with these providers or their provision of services to
us, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We have engaged third-party
service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral
to our business, such as operation of United Express flights, operation
of customer service call centers, provision of information technology infrastructure
and services, provision of maintenance and repairs, provision of various
utilities, performance of aircraft fueling operations, and many other vital
functions and services. We do not directly control these third-party providers,
although we do enter into agreements with many of them which define expected
service performance. Any of these third-party providers, however, may materially
fail to meet their service performance commitments to the Company. The
failure of these providers to adequately perform their service obligations,
or other unexpected interruptions of services, may reduce our revenues
and increase our expenses, or prevent us from operating our flights and
providing other services to our customers. In addition, our business and
financial performance could be materially harmed if our customers believe
that our services are unreliable or unsatisfactory.
</p><p><b><i>Our high level of fixed obligations could limit our ability to
fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, could
limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and could
increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We have a significant amount
of financial leverage from fixed obligations, including the Credit Facility,
aircraft lease and debt financings, leases of airport property and other
facilities, and other material cash obligations. In addition, the Company
has pledged substantially all of its available assets as collateral to
secure its various fixed obligations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our high level of fixed obligations
and lack of significant unencumbered assets or a downgrade in our existing
credit rating could impair our ability to obtain additional financing,
if needed, and reduce our flexibility in the conduct of our business. Certain
of our existing indebtedness also requires the Company to meet covenants
and financial tests to maintain ongoing access to those borrowings. See
Note 9, "Long-term Debt" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>
for further details. A failure to pay our fixed costs, or other breach
of our contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences,
including the acceleration of our indebtedness, the withholding of credit
card sale proceeds by our credit card service providers, and the exercise
of other remedies by our creditors and lessors which could result in material
adverse effects on our operations and financial condition. In such a situation,
it is unlikely that we would be able to fulfill our obligations to repay
the accelerated indebtedness, make required lease payments, or otherwise
cover our fixed costs.
</p><p><b><i>Our net operating loss carry forwards may be limited.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, prior
to our emergence from bankruptcy, we had estimated net operating loss carry
forwards ("NOLs") to be $7.0 billion for federal and state income tax purposes
that will expire over a five to twenty year period. The Company expects
that the issuance of its common stock to creditors upon emergence from
bankruptcy may have the effect of increasing these NOLs in 2006. If we
were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code, under current conditions, our annual federal
NOL utilization could be limited to an amount equal to our market capitalization
at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the federal long-term
tax exempt rate.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To avoid a potential adverse
effect on the Company's ability to utilize its NOLs for federal income
tax purposes after the Effective Date, the Company's certificate of incorporation
contains a "5% Ownership Limitation," applicable to all stockholders except
the PBGC. The 5% Ownership Limitation remains effective until February
1, 2011. While the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent
a change of ownership from occurring within the meaning of Section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code (which ownership change would materially adversely
affect the Company's ability to utilize its NOLs or other tax attributes),
no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur,
in which case the availability of the Company's substantial NOLs and other
federal income tax attributes would be significantly limited or possibly
eliminated.
</p><p><b><i>The loss of skilled employees upon whom we depend to operate our
business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could
adversely affect our results of operations.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We believe that our future
success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain
highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not
be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting and retaining
other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract significant
numbers of qualified management and other personnel could adversely affect
our business.
</p><p><b><i>We could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that
affects travel behavior.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; An outbreak of a disease
that affects travel behavior, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
("SARS") or avian flu, could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
</p><p><b><u>Risks Related to Our Common Stock</u></b>
</p><p><b><i>Our common stock has a very limited trading history and its market
price may be volatile.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Because our common stock
began trading after the Effective Date on the NASDAQ National Market on
February 2, 2006, there is very little trading history. The market price
of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors,
many of which are beyond our control.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Certain provisions of the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws of UAL may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition
of our board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some
of our stockholders may consider beneficial.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Certain provisions of the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws of UAL may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in
control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control
are not in the best interests of UAL and its stockholders.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; These provisions are not
intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize
the value of our stockholders' interests. While these provisions have the
effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company
to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable our board of
directors to prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders
might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent
or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.
</p><p><b><i>The issuance of additional shares of our common stock, including
upon conversion of our convertible preferred stock and our convertible
notes, could cause dilution to the interests of our existing stockholders.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In connection with our emergence
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, we issued 5,000,000 shares of 2%
convertible preferred stock. This preferred stock may be converted into
shares of our common stock upon the earlier of February 1, 2008, or upon
a fundamental change or change in control of the Company. Further, the
preferred stock is mandatorily convertible 15 years from the issuance date.
We also issued approximately $150 million in convertible 5% notes shortly
after the Effective Date, and we are required to issue approximately $726
million in additional convertible notes within the first six months after
the Effective Date. Holders of these securities may convert them into shares
of our common stock according to their terms. If the holders of the convertible
preferred stock or the holders of the convertible notes decided to exercise
their rights to convert their securities into common stock, it could cause
substantial dilution to existing stockholders. For further information,
see Note 1 "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 - Bankruptcy Considerations"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our certificate of incorporation
authorizes us up to 1 billion shares of common stock. In certain circumstances,
we can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval. In addition,
our board of directors is authorized to issue additional series of up to
250 million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of
our stockholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder
approval, to set the terms of any such series of shares of preferred stock
that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, dividend
rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or
if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms. If we
issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common
stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights
that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders
of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely
affected. We are also authorized to issue, without stockholder approval,
other securities convertible into either preferred stock and, in certain
circumstances, common stock. In the future we may decide to raise capital
through offerings of our common stock, securities convertible into our
common stock, or rights to acquire these securities or our common stock.
The issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible
into common stock could result in dilution of existing stockholders' equity
interests in us. Issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock,
or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect
prevailing market prices for our common stock and we cannot predict the
effect this dilution may have on the price of our common stock.

</p><p><b><u>Ground Facilities</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We have entered into various
leases relating to our use of airport landing areas, gates, hangar sites,
terminal buildings and other airport facilities in most of the municipalities
we serve. These leases were subject to assumption or rejection under the
Chapter 11 process. As of December 31, 2005, we had assumed major facility
leases in Washington (Dulles and Reagan), Denver (terminal lease only),
San Francisco, Newark (terminal lease only), Austin, Cleveland, Columbus,
Detroit (terminal lease only), Las Vegas, Oakland, Portland, Fort Meyers
(fuel system lease only), Orange County and Tucson. Major facility leases
expire at San Francisco in 2011 and 2013, Washington-Dulles in 2014, Chicago

space for our world headquarters, a computer facility and a training center.
We also own a flight training center, located in Denver, which can accommodate
36 flight simulators and more than 90 computer-based training stations.
We own a limited number of other properties, including a reservations facility

</p><p><b>ITEM 3.&#160; LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.</b>
</p><p><b><u>In re: UAL Corporation, et. al.</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As discussed above, on the
Petition Date the Debtors filed voluntary petitions to reorganize their
businesses under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On October 20, 2005,
the Debtors filed the Debtor's First Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization
Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the Disclosure
Statement. The Bankruptcy Court approved the Disclosure Statement on October
21, 2005.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Commencing on October 27,
2005, the Disclosure Statement, ballots for voting to accept or reject
the proposed plan of reorganization and other solicitation documents were
distributed to all classes of creditors eligible to vote on the proposed
plan of reorganization. After a hearing on confirmation, on January 20,
2006, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Reorganization. The Plan
of Reorganization became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy
protection on the Effective Date.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Numerous pre-petition claims
still await resolution in the Bankruptcy Court due to the Company's objections
to either the existence of liability or the amount of the claim. The process
of
determining whether liability exists and liquidating the amounts due
is likely to continue for the remainder of 2006. Additionally, certain
significant matters remain to be resolved in the Bankruptcy Court. For
details see Note 1, "<i>Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 - Bankruptcy
Considerations</i>" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p><b><u>Summers v. UAL Corporation ESOP, et. al.</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Certain participants in the
UAL Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") sued the ESOP, the
ESOP Committee and State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street")
in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the "District
Court") in February 2003 seeking monetary damages in a purported class
action that alleges that the ESOP Committee breached its fiduciary duty
by not selling UAL stock held by the ESOP commencing as of July 19, 2001.
The ESOP Committee appointed State Street in September 2002 to act as investment
manager and fiduciary to manage the assets of the ESOP itself. The parties
entered into a stipulation under which the plaintiffs agreed to proceed
only against the $10 million in insurance proceeds available from a policy
held by UAL Corporation in return for the Company and the ESOP Committee's
agreement to lift the automatic stay and allow the litigation to proceed.
As a part of this agreement, the ESOP Committee agreed to withdraw the
indemnification claims they filed against the Company in the Chapter 11
case. The District Court subsequently entered an order certifying the class,
which both State Street and the ESOP Committee defendants appealed.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In August 2005, a proposed
settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the ESOP Committee defendants.
The agreed upon settlement amount is to be paid out of the remaining $10
million insurance proceeds. State Street is not a party to settlement and
objected to the settlement during the fairness hearing.&#160;&#160; The
District Court approved the settlement agreement in October 2005. State
Street appealed that decision to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
Also, the District Court granted State Street's motion for summary judgment.
The plaintiffs have appealed that decision in turn. All appeals have been
consolidated and are scheduled for oral argument on April 4, 2006.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; State Street filed a pre-petition
indemnification claim against the Company under its Investment Manager
Agreement as Trustee of the ESOP at the beginning of the Chapter 11 case.
On March 2, 2006, State Street filed an application in the Chapter 11 case
seeking allowance and payment of an administrative claim of approximately
$4.1 million to indemnify State Street for defense costs incurred in the
litigation. A hearing on State Street's application is scheduled for April
28, 2006.
</p><p><b><u>Litigation Associated with September 11 Terrorism</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Families of 94 victims of
the September 11 terrorist attacks filed lawsuits asserting a variety of
claims against the airline industry. United and American Airlines, as the
two carriers whose flights were hijacked, are the central focus of the
litigation, but a variety of additional parties have been sued on a number
of legal theories ranging from collective responsibility for airport screening
and security systems that allegedly failed to prevent the attacks to faulty
design and construction of the World Trade Center towers. In excess of
97% of the families of the deceased victims received awards from the September
11<sup>th</sup> Victims Compensation Fund of 2001, which was established
by the federal government, and consequently are now barred from making
further claims against the airlines. World Trade Center Properties, Inc.
and The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have filed cross-claims
in the wrongful death litigation against all of the aviation defendants
as owners of the World Trade Center property for property damage sustained
in the attacks. The insurers of various tenants at the World Trade Center
have filed subrogation claims for damages as well. In the aggregate, September
11<sup>th</sup> claims are estimated to be well in excess of $10 billion.
By statute, these matters were consolidated in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York, and airline exposure was capped
at the limit of the liability coverage maintained by each carrier at the
time of the attacks. While the temporary suspension of litigation activity
is no longer in place in the personal injury and wrongful death matters,
settlement discussions continue and the parties have reached settlements
in several matters. The Company anticipates that any liability it may face
arising from the events of September 11, 2001 could be significant, but
will be subject to the statutory limitation to the amount of its insurance
coverage.
</p><p><b><u>Environmental Proceedings</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In accordance with an order
issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board in June 1999,
United, along with most of the other tenants of the San Francisco International
Airport, has been investigating potential environmental contamination at
the airport and conducting remediation when needed. Work under this order
includes investigation and remediation that United is conducting for solvent
impacts to soil, bedrock, and groundwater at United's San Francisco Maintenance
Center.
</p><p><b><u>Other Legal Proceedings</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL and United are involved
in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of business. From time to time we become aware of potential non-compliance
with environmental regulations, which have either been identified by the
Company (through our internal environmental compliance auditing program)
or through notice from a governmental entity. In some instances, these
matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial
proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions. We believe,
after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the
views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which we are subject
and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies
will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results
of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.</font></b>
</p><p><b><u><font size="+0">Overview</font></u></b>
</p><p><font size="+0"><font face="Arial">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </font>Over
the past several years, United and the airline industry have been faced
with severe business challenges and fundamental changes in the airline
industry which have produced material adverse impacts on the Company's
results of operations, financial position and liquidity. The Company reported
losses from operations of $219 million, $854 million and $1,360 million
for years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively; and reported
net losses of $21.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion for the same
respective periods. The Company had been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since December 9, 2002 and emerged on February 1, 2006.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the last
few years, operating revenues for the airline industry in general, as well
as for United, have been adversely impacted by a number of factors. The
growth of LCCs; excess industry seat capacity; pricing transparency; periodic
unfavorable general economic conditions that have reduced the demand for
high-yield business travel; global events such as the war in Iraq, the
outbreak of SARS in early 2003 as well as the general public's fear of
future terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001; and the enactment of
federal taxes on ticket sales to fund additional airport security measures,
have caused yield to decline from 13.25 cents in 2000 (the last year we
reported an operating profit) to 11.25 cents in 2005.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 2005, yield
partially recovered, increasing by 4% over 2004 and 2003. Passenger load
factor improved to 81.4% from 79.2% in 2004 and 76.5% in 2003. PRASM was
9.20 cents, or 7% higher than 2004 and 11% higher than 2003. These results
reflect a 3% reduction in system capacity from 2004 to 2005, but a 3% increase
in capacity in 2005 over 2003. As announced in the fourth quarter of 2004,
the Company has shifted significant amounts of capacity from domestic to
international markets and believes that its and other airlines actions
to reduce domestic overcapacity are contributing to recent unit revenue
improvements.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company's
operating expenses have fluctuated as it sought to restructure its obligations
in bankruptcy, adjust its mainline and regional carrier operating capacity
to match marketplace demand, and cope with historically high jet fuel prices
throughout recent years. CASM increased from 10.65 cents in 2000 to 12.03
cents in 2001, and then declined back to 10.59cents in 2005. In spite of
significant accomplishments in restructuring our operating expenses, including
significant contributions from employees and creditors through the bankruptcy
process, high fuel costs have had a significant adverse affect on unit
operating costs, particularly in 2005 and 2004. In 2005, CASM was 4% and
1% higher than it was in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in mainline
fuel price between periods added approximately nine tenths of a cent, and
one point four cents, to CASM in 2005, as compared to 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In 2005, mainline fuel expense was our largest category of operating expense,
surpassing salary and related costs which have traditionally been our largest
operating cost.</font>
</p><p><b><u><font size="+0">Chapter 11 Restructuring Efforts</font></u></b>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; By using the
means available to the Company throughout the bankruptcy process as well
as focusing on continuous improvement initiatives to increase the efficiency
and effectiveness of its operations, the Company expects to realize approximately
$7 billion in average annual cash and contractual savings. These savings
were primarily derived from labor and benefit restructurings (including
the termination of all of the Company's under-funded defined benefit pension
plans in the U.S.), implementation of business improvement initiatives,
restructuring of its relationships with its United Express partners, and
aircraft financing restructurings. In total, our restructuring has made
the Company cost-competitive with other U.S. network carriers.</font>
</p><p><i><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Labor
and Benefit Restructuring</b>.</font></i><font size="+0">&#160; In addition
to pay and benefit reductions imposed on its salaried and management workforce,
the Company reached consensual agreements with each of its labor unions
to reduce labor costs through a combination of lower pay rates, decreased
benefit costs and higher productivity. Additionally, all represented employee
groups agreed to eliminate requirements in their respective CBAs to maintain
a defined benefit pension plan. Thus, the Company terminated all of its
under-funded U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Pilot Plan is subject
to the outcome of the matters being considered by the District Court as
more fully described in Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter
11 - Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in Bankruptcy Court"
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These CBAs are not
amendable until January 2010 and contain no "snapback" or "re-opener" provisions.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In exchange
for these savings, the Company agreed to provide each employee group a
portion of the equity provided to general unsecured creditors under the
Plan of Reorganization. Each employee group received a distribution (or
a "deemed claim") based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided
by that group. The total value of the deemed claim amount that was used
to determine this distribution to employees was approximately $7.4 billion.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Further,
the Company agreed to provide to its U.S. employees, both union and non-
represented, over $726 million in convertible notes, to be issued no later
than six months after the Effective Date. These notes were promised in
recognition that, among other things, all of these employee groups agreed
to the termination of their defined benefit pension plans.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><b>Business Improvement
Initiatives</b>. </i>The Company has successfully implemented certain business
improvement initiatives primarily focused on optimizing resources and lowering
distribution costs, including such initiatives as lowering the cost of
aircraft maintenance and airport operations through more efficient use
of labor and non-labor resources; call center automation and off shoring;
renegotiation of United Express capacity agreements; and providing customers
with low-cost alternatives to reserve and purchase airline seats. The Company
will continue to identify opportunities to operate our business more efficiently
through similar continuous improvement initiatives in the future.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><b>Significant
Matters Remaining to be Resolved in Bankruptcy Court</b>. </i>During the
course of our Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company successfully reached
settlements with most of its creditors and resolved most pending claims
against the Debtors. However, the following material matters remain to
be resolved in the Bankruptcy Court. For further details, see Note 1, "Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11 - Bankruptcy Considerations" in the <u>Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0"><b><font face="Arial">&#160;</font></b>&#160;&#160; <i><u>Section
1110 Aircraft Restructuring</u>.</i>&#160; The Company negotiated with
its aircraft lessors and lenders to restructure debt and lease financings
to reduce aircraft ownership costs to current market rates, and was successful
in reaching agreements to restructure such transactions with respect to
a majority of our financed aircraft. However, certain aircraft financings
are still unresolved and subject to further negotiations. United cannot
accurately predict the outcome of these negotiations, and it could potentially
have a material adverse impact on the Company.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Municipal Bond Obligations</u></i>.
The Company is a party to numerous long-term agreements to lease certain
airport and maintenance facilities that are financed through tax-exempt
municipal bonds that are issued by various local municipalities to build
or improve airport and maintenance facilities. As a result of the Company's
bankruptcy filing, we were not permitted to make payments on unsecured
pre-petition debt. The Company had been advised that these municipal bonds
may be unsecured (or in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition
debt. Therefore, through the bankruptcy process, the Company had either
settled or rejected certain pre-petition debt associated with the municipal
bonds. The ultimate disposition of a portion of the outstanding municipal
bond obligations remains subject to the uncertain outcome of pending litigation.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Claims Resolution
Process</u></i>. Despite the Company's emergence from Chapter 11 protection,
many unsecured proofs of claim remain unresolved. Since the Effective Date
and in accordance with the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, the Company
has continued to review the claims register and believes that many of the
filed proofs of claim are invalid, untimely, duplicative, or overstated,
and therefore is in the process of objecting to such claims. Differences
between claim amounts filed and the Company's estimates of claims to be
allowed are being investigated and will be resolved in connection with
its claims resolution process. In this regard, it should be noted that
the claims reconciliation process may result in material adjustments after
the Effective Date.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Pension Terminations</u></i>.
Currently, there is a dispute as to whether the United Airlines Pilot Defined
Benefit Pension Plan (the "Pilot Plan") was effectively terminated under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") Section 4042 with
a termination date of December 30, 2004. ALPA and the United Retired Pilots
Benefit Protection Association and seven retired pilots (collectively,
"URPBPA") and the PBGC filed notices of appeal and in February 2006, the
District Court reversed the Bankruptcy Court's order based on a determination
that the Bankruptcy Court lacked "core" jurisdiction over the Involuntary
Termination Proceeding. However, the District Court did not address the
substantive merits of the Bankruptcy Court's ruling. The District Court
remanded the proceedings to the Bankruptcy Court so that the Bankruptcy
Court could submit proposed findings and conclusions of law to be forwarded
to the District Court for review, which has since happened. The District
Court's determination (and that of any court considering an appeal of the
District Court's order) regarding the termination of the Pilot Plan may
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>ALPA Convertible
Notes</u></i>. In January 2005, United filed a motion seeking approval
of the new CBA with ALPA pursuant to Section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.
The Bankruptcy Court approved the ALPA agreement over the objections of
various parties. The active pilots ratified the agreement, and the Bankruptcy
Court entered an order approving the ALPA agreement (the "ALPA Order").
In February 2005, URPBPA filed its notice of appeal of the ALPA Order based
principally on the allegation that United was unfairly treating the retired
pilots by not distributing the same unsecured notes to the retired pilots
that it was distributing to the active pilots pursuant to the ALPA agreement.
In June 2005, the District Court entered an order and memorandum opinion
dismissing URPBPA's appeal of the ALPA Order as interlocutory. URPBPA appealed
the District Court's judgment to the Court of Appeals. The parties fully
briefed the matter and the Court of Appeals heard oral argument in February
2006, though it has not yet ruled on the matter. Additionally, the Company
filed with the Court of Appeals a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground
that (i) no effective relief can be granted to the appellants and/or (ii)
if relief could be granted, it would be highly inequitable to do so. The
Court of Appeals has not yet ruled on United's motion to dismiss or indicated
whether it will hear further argument on the matter.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Objections to the
Plan of Reorganization Confirmation</u></i>. Two parties have filed notices
of appeal of the order confirming the Plan of Reorganization.&#160; If
the Bankruptcy Court were to grant these appeals, it could have a materially
adverse effect on the Company.</font>
</p><p><b><u><font size="+0">Results of Operations</font></u></b>
</p><p><font size="+0"><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>The
air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our operations
can be adversely impacted by severe weather and our first and fourth quarter
results normally reflect lower travel demand. Historically, results of
operations are better in the second and third quarters which reflect higher
levels of travel demand.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Summary of Results.
</b>UAL's
loss from operations in 2005 was $219 million, compared to losses from
operations of $854 million in 2004 and $1.4 billion in 2003. UAL's net
loss for 2005 was $21.2 billion, or $182.29 per share, compared to net
losses of $1.7 billion, or $15.25 per share in 2004 and $2.8 billion, or
$27.36 per share in 2003.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Effective February
1, 2006, the Company is no longer operating under Chapter 11 protection.
As a result of the Company's emergence from bankruptcy and the adoption
of fresh start accounting, the 2005 financial results are not indicative
of future results.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition,
fuel price fluctuations can have a material impact on the Company's future
financial performance. For example, a one cent change in fuel price can
either increase or decrease the Company's annual operating expenses by
approximately $20 million.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The 2005 results
include $18 million in operating special items and $20.6 billion in reorganization
expenses related to the Company's bankruptcy filing.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The 2004 results
included a favorable adjustment to passenger mainline revenue of $60 million
and non-operating special items of $5 million. Additionally, non-operating
expense includes $158 million in gains from the sale of investments as
well as $611 million in reorganization expenses related to the Company's
bankruptcy filing.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The 2003 results
include operating special items of $178 million (including curtailment
and special termination charges of $152 million) and non-operating special
items of $251 million. Additionally, non-operating expense includes $300
million in government compensation and $158 million in gains from the sale
of investments, as well as $1.2 billion in reorganization expenses related
to the Company's bankruptcy filing.</font>

cents. Mainline passenger revenues increased 3%, or $372 million, due to
a 4% increase in yield slightly offset by a decline in RPMs of 1%. ASMs
decreased 3%; however, passenger load factor increased 2.2 points to 81.4%.

<font size="+0"><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Other income
(expense).</i></b> Other non-operating expense amounted to $872 million
in 2004 (which included $5 million of special items, $611 million of reorganization
items, net and $158 million of gains on sales), as compared to $1.4 billion
in 2003 (which included $251 million of special items, $1.2 billion of
reorganization items, net, $158 million of gains on sales and $300 million
of government compensation). For further information, see Note 1, "Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11 - Financial Statement Presentation", Note
3, "Special Items" and Note 7, "Investments" in the
<u>Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements</u>. Interest expense decreased 15%, or $78 million,
primarily due to a lower number of mortgaged aircraft and lower fees and
interest associated with our DIP Financing. Interest income decreased 55%,
or $30 million, primarily due to interest income on IRS tax refunds received
in 2003 and higher amounts of interest earned on restricted cash in 2004.</font>
<p><b><u><font size="+0">Liquidity and Capital Resources</font></u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Liquidity</i>.</b>
UAL's total of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, including
restricted cash, was $2.8 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to $2.2
billion at December 31, 2004.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December 31, 2005,
we had $957 million in restricted cash, an increase of $80 million as compared
to December 31, 2004. Restricted cash primarily represents cash collateral
to secure workers' compensation obligations, security deposits for airport
leases and reserves with institutions that process our credit card ticket
sales. Prior to 2003, we met many of these obligations (which were smaller
in amount) through surety bonds or secured letters of credit; however,
such facilities are currently largely unavailable to us. As a result, we
may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet
such obligations in the future.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In October 2005, we entered
into a new processing agreement for MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions
with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Paymentech, L.P. The agreement replaces
our former processing agreement with National Processing Company (which
expired on January 15, 2006) and provides credit card processing services
for transactions on and after January 11, 2006. The processing agreement
required us to initially establish a restricted cash reserve to secure
the potential obligations to customers using a credit card form of payment
in the event the Company does not provide the ticketed transportation services.
The amount of this reserve is determined by applying a reserve percentage
to the Company's aggregate then-outstanding bank card air traffic liability.
The reserve percentage will vary between zero and 100% based upon our credit
rating and our ability to comply with the fixed charge ratio and unrestricted
cash covenants under the Credit Facility. See Note 9, "Long-Term Debt"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>. The processing
agreement expires on December 31, 2012.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Concurrently with entering
into the processing agreement, we entered into an amendment to our agreement
with Chase Bank USA N.A. ("Chase") regarding the Mileage Plus Visa card
under which Chase pays for frequent flyer miles earned by Mileage Plus
members for making purchases using the Mileage Plus Visa card. In addition
to extending the agreement until 2012 and making certain other adjustments
in the relationship, the agreement provides for an advance purchase of
miles approximately equal to the initial amount of the reserve account
under the processing agreement. As a result, the reserve account provisions
of the processing agreement initially did not have a significant effect
on our liquidity. Any significant future increase in the reserve percentage
under the processing agreement could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Operating Activities.</u></i>
For the year ended December 31, 2005, we generated cash from operations
of $1.1 billion, an increase of $980 million as compared to cash generated
from operations in 2004 and an 8% increase over the $1.0 billion in cash
generated from operations in 2003. The higher operating cash generated
in 2005 is largely due to increased passenger revenues and lower salary
and related costs, partially offset by increased fuel costs. The operating
cash generated in 2003 included the receipt of $365 million in income tax
refunds and $314 million in government compensation, together with other
working capital changes.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In October 2003, United and
one of its subsidiaries, UAFC, entered into an agreement with a third-party
to supply approximately 50% of the fuel required by United and UAFC and
to assume some of their supply, infrastructure and third-party sale agreements.
The third-party acquires fuel on behalf of United and UAFC, transports
it and maintains minimum inventory levels at specified locations for subsequent
sale to them. Under this arrangement, the Company generated approximately
$105 million of additional working capital during 2004 by reducing working
capital requirements for fuel inventory and accounts receivable.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company contributed $127
million towards its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension funds in 2004
and $6 million in 2003, but made no cash contributions in 2005. In addition,
the Company contributed $61 million, $75 million and $80 million in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, largely towards its non-U.S. pension plans
and its U.S. non-qualified pension plans. Detailed information regarding
our pension plans is included in Note 15, "Retirement and Postretirement
Plans" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Investing Activities.</u></i>
Cash used in investing activities was $291 million in 2005 and $296 million
in 2004 compared to cash generated from investing activities of $339 million
in 2003. During 2003, changes to the Company's liquidity needs and the
interest rate environment resulted in the Company no longer purchasing
investments with maturities in excess of 90 days.&#160; This change significantly
reduced cash proceeds from short-term investments in 2005 and 2004.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2005, the Company
sold ten B727, five B737 and seven B767 aircraft and rejected or returned
to the lessor 30 B737 aircraft, ten B767 aircraft and one B747 aircraft
under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company reacquired eight
B767 aircraft, of which four were purchased by the Company from the Public
Debt Group and subsequently sold to a third-party and simultaneously leased
back, and of which four aircraft were acquired directly by a third-party
from the Public Debt Group and subsequently leased to the Company. In addition,
the Company, as part of its agreement with the Public Debt Group, purchased
six additional B767 aircraft from the Public Debt Group, which were subsequently
sold to and leased back from third parties.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Additionally, during 2004,
we received $218 million from the sales of our investments in Orbitz and
Air Canada. In 2003, we received $150 million related to the sale of our
investments in Hotwire, Orbitz and Cendant.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Financing Activities.</u></i>
Cash used in financing activities was $110 million in 2005, $72 million
in 2004 and $404 million in 2003. During 2005, we made principal payments
under long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $285 million and
$94 million, respectively.
</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;</font></font>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During 2005, we made $16 million in principal payments on the DIP Financing.
In addition, we renegotiated and expanded our DIP Financing facility, allowing
us to borrow an additional $310 million during 2005. The amended DIP Financing
facility also permitted us to make capital expenditures not exceeding $750
million towards aircraft acquisitions, with cash expenditures for such
acquisitions not to exceed $300 million. This capital expenditures basket
was created primarily to allow the Company to purchase certain aircraft
that were controlled by the Public Debt Group, all of which were already
in our fleet or had been in our fleet in the recent past.&#160; The Company
raised $253 million in connection with the subsequent long-termfinancing
of ten of the B767 aircraft acquired from the Public Debt Group.
</p><p><font face="Courier New"><font size="-1">&#160;&#160;&#160; </font></font>During
2004, we made $313 million in principal payments on the DIP Financing.
In addition, we renegotiated and expanded our DIP Financing availability,
allowing us to borrow an additional $513 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2003, the sale of
two B747 aircraft and certain equity investments enabled us to pay down
a portion of the DIP Financing, allowing for additional amounts to be drawn
during the year. This activity resulted in a net reduction to our obligations
under the DIP Financing of $37 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, we
had a total of $1.2 billion in debt outstanding under the DIP Financing
and $39 million in letters of credit. The DIP Financing was repaid on the
Effective Date with the proceeds from the Credit Facility. For further
details, see Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 - DIP Financing"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>The Company secured access to up to $3.0 billion in exit financing which
consists of a $2.8 billion term loan and a $200 million revolving credit
line. On the Effective Date, $2.45 billion of the $2.8 billion term loan
and the entire revolving credit line was drawn and used to repay the DIP
Financing as noted above and to make other payments required upon exit
from bankruptcy, as well as to provide ongoing liquidity to conduct post-reorganization
operations. Subsequently, the Company repaid $161 million on the revolving
credit line and accessed the remaining $350 million on the term loan. For
further details on the Credit Facility, see Note 9, "Long-term Debt" in
the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Capital Commitments
and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.&#160;&#160; </i></b>Our business is
very capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund
the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, we have
funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing
debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings.
We also often enter into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure
access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities. As
can be seen in the table below, these operating lease commitments (which
are sometimes referred to as "off-balance sheet arrangements") are significant.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Following is a summary of
our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Although we were not generally
permitted to make any payments on pre-petition debt as a result of the
bankruptcy filing, we reached agreements with certain aircraft financiers
under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code and received approval from the
Bankruptcy Court to continue to make such payments on certain aircraft
debt and lease obligations. The amounts included in the above table represent
only those obligations for which we have finalized an agreement.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005,
our future cash postretirement benefit payments approximated $1.6 billion
for the period of 2006 through 2015. Due to uncertainties regarding significant
assumptions involved in estimating future benefit payments under our postretirement
obligations (such as health care cost trend rates and discount rates),
we are not able to reasonably estimate our future required cash flows beyond
2015.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005,
future commitments for the purchase of property and equipment, principally
aircraft, approximated $1.8 billion, after deducting advance payments.&#160;
Our current commitments are primarily for the purchase of A319 and A320
aircraft.&#160; In January 2006, we reached an agreement with the airframe
manufacturer to delay, with the right to cancel these future orders.&#160;
We also reached an agreement with the engine manufacturer eliminating all
provisions pertaining to firm commitments and support for future Airbus
aircraft. While this permits future negotiations on engine pricing with
any engine manufacturer, restructured aircraft manufacturer commitments
have assumed that aircraft will be delivered with installed engines at
list price. As a result of these subsequent changes, estimated future commitments
have increased to $2.5 billion in early 2006, after deducting advanced
payments.&#160; An estimated $0.1 billion will be spent in 2006, $0.1 billion
for years 2007 and 2008, $0.1 billion for years 2009 and 2010 and $2.2
billion thereafter.&#160; The disposition of $91 million of advance payments
made by the Company is subject to United taking future delivery of these
aircraft.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; See Note 9, "Long-Term Debt,"
Note 10, "Lease Obligations," Note 15, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans"
and Note 16, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties" in
the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u> for additional discussion
of these items.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</u></i>
- An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other
contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which
a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest
in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified
as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest
in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market
risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing,
hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. UAL
has off-balance sheet arrangements related to (1) and (4) above, as noted
below.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Certain municipalities issued
municipal bonds on behalf of United to finance the construction of improvements
at airport-related facilities. The Company also leases facilities at airports
where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airport-related
projects. However, as a result of our bankruptcy filing, we were not permitted
to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt. We have been advised that
our municipal bonds may be unsecured (or in certain instances, partially
secured) pre-petition debt. The Company determined that these bonds were
pre-petition obligations and accordingly reclassified certain accrued and
unpaid rent pertaining to these off-balance sheet arrangements to liabilities
subject to compromise. At December 31, 2005, $510 million in principal
of such bonds was outstanding but not recorded in the <u>Statements of
Consolidated Financial Position</u> in accordance with GAAP. UAL guaranteed
$60 million and United guaranteed $510 million of such bonds, including
accrued interest. For further details, see Note 1 "Voluntary Reorganization
Under Chapter 11 - Bankruptcy Considerations" and Note 16, "Commitments,
Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties - Financings and Guarantees" in
the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We have various financing
arrangements for aircraft in which the lessors are trusts established specifically
to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to us. These leasing entities meet
the criteria for variable interest entities; however, we are not considered
the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities since the lease terms are
consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include
a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature
that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate
in increases in the value of the aircraft. These financing arrangements
include 76 aircraft operating leases that contain a fair market value purchase
option. These leases became effective upon the confirmation of the Plan
of Reorganization.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company has 97 additionaloperating
leases, for which all but 26 have a fixed price or fair market value purchase
option. United does not guarantee the residual value of these aircraft.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition, the Company
has operating leases for aircraft and facilities (including the aircraft
noted above) with total future minimum lease payments of $12.1 billion
as of December 31, 2005. For detailed information, see Note 10, "Lease
Obligations" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Capital Resources.</i></b>
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., The CIT Group/Business Credit,
Inc. and General Electric Capital Corporation provided our DIP Financing,
a $1.7 billion financing facility (subject to a $100 million reserve for
collateral maintenance and liquidation expenses) which was available to
the Company while it was in bankruptcy. The DIP Financing consisted of
a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of $200 million and a
term loan of $1.5 billion, which was scheduled to mature on March 31, 2006.
At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding borrowings of $1.2 billion and
issued letters of credit totaling $39 million.
</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></font>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On the Effective Date, the Company secured access to the Credit Facility
for an amount up to $3.0 billion which consists of a $2.8 billion term
loan and a $200 million revolving credit line. The Credit Facility matures
on February 1, 2012. On the Effective Date, $2.45 billion of the $2.8 billion
term loan and the entire revolving credit line was drawn and used to repay
the DIP Financing and to make other payments required upon exit from bankruptcy,
as well as to provide ongoing liquidity to conduct post-reorganization
operations. Subsequently, the Company repaid $161 million on the revolving
credit line and accessed the remaining $350 million on the term loan. We
expect to be in compliance with the Credit Facility covenants, but there
are no assurances we will be able to do so. Failure to comply with the
covenants could result in a default under the Credit Facility unless we
obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default. Additionally, the
Credit Facility contains a cross-default provision with respect to defaults
on our other credit arrangements that exceed $40 million. A default could
result in a termination of the Credit Facility and a requirement to accelerate
repayment of all outstanding borrowings. We believe that the combination
of cash flows generated by operations as well as the net cash proceeds
provided by the Credit Facility will be adequate to satisfy our projected
liquidity needs over the next twelve months. For further details about
our Credit Facility and the associated covenants, see Note 9, "Long-Term
Debt" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Future Financing</u></i>.
Substantially all of our unencumbered assets are pledged to the Credit
Facility. Subject to the restrictions of our Credit Facility, the Company
could raise additional capital by issuing unsecured debt, equity or equity-like
securities, monetizing or borrowing against certain assets or refinancing
existing obligations to generate net cash proceeds. However, the availability
and capacity of these funding sources cannot be assured or predicted.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As part of its exit from
bankruptcy, United and UAL received a corporate credit rating of B (outlook
stable) from Standard &amp; Poor's and a corporate family rating of B2
(outlook stable) from Moody's Investors Services. These credit ratings
are below investment grade levels. Downgrades from these rating levels
could restrict the availability and/or increase the cost of future financing
for the Company.
</p><p><b><u>Other Information</u></b>
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial"><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></font>
Price Competition.</i></b>&#160;&#160; The airline industry is highly competitive,
characterized by intense price competition.&#160; In early 2005, United's
domestic competitors initiated fundamental changes to their fare structures
to compete with the industry-wide expansion of LCC's.&#160;&#160; Fare
discounting by our competitors has historically had a negative effect on
our financial results because we are generally required to match competitors'
fares to maintain passenger traffic.&#160; We are unable to accurately
predict the potential financial impact of existing and future competitive
fare adjustments on our financial results.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Foreign Operations.</i></b>&#160;
We generate revenues and incur expenses in numerous foreign currencies.
Such expenses include fuel, aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel
expense, advertising and distribution costs, customer service expenses
and aircraft maintenance. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact
our results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign
currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Despite the adverse effects
a strengthening foreign currency may have on demand for U.S. originating
traffic, a strengthening of foreign currencies tends to increase reported
revenue and operating income because our foreign currency-denominated operating
revenue generally exceeds our foreign currency-denominated operating expense
for each currency. Likewise, despite the favorable effects a weakening
foreign currency may have on demand for U.S. originating traffic, a weakening
of foreign currencies tends to decrease reported revenue and operating
income.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our biggest net foreign currency
exposures are typically for the Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Australian
dollar, British pound, Korean won, Hong Kong dollar, European euro and
Japanese yen. The table below sets forth our net exposure to various currencies
for 2005:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our foreign operations involve
insignificant amounts of dedicated physical assets; however, we do have
sizable intangible assets related to our previous acquisitions of Atlantic
and Latin American route authorities. See Note 2(k), "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies - Intangibles" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements</u> for further information. Because operating authorities in
international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between
the U.S. and foreign countries, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation
policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service
agreements that could adversely impact the value of our international route
authorities. Significant changes in such policies could also have a material
impact on our operating revenues and expenses and results of operations.
See Item 1. Business - "Industry Regulation - International Regulation"
for further information.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Environmental and Legal
Contingencies</i>.</b>&#160; United has been named as a Potentially Responsible
Party at certain Environmental Protection Agency or State Environmental
Protection Agency ("EPA" or "State EPA") cleanup sites that have been designated
as Superfund Sites. Our alleged proportionate contributions at the sites
are minimal; however, at sites where the EPA or State EPA has commenced
litigation or administrative proceedings, potential liability is joint
and several. Additionally, we have participated in, and are participating
in, remediation actions at certain other sites, primarily airports. We
accrue the estimated cost of these remediation actions when we have determined
that it is probable that we are liable. Environmental regulations and remediation
processes are subject to future change, and determining the actual cost
of remediation often requires further investigation and additional progress
of the remediation. Therefore, the ultimate disposition cannot be exactly
predicted. However, while such ultimate cost may vary from our current
estimate, we believe the difference between the accrued reserve and the
ultimate liability will not be material.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL has certain other contingencies
resulting from the above environmental actions and other litigation and
claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes,
after considering a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the
views of legal counsel and the nature of such contingencies and prior experience,
that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially
affect the Company's financial condition, operating results or liquidity.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company anticipates that
if ultimately found liable, its damages from claims arising from the events
of September 11, 2001 could be significant; however, we believe that, under
the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001, our
liability will be limited to our insurance coverage. We have not incurred
any material environmental obligations relating to the events of September
11, 2001.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Critical Accounting
Policies.</i>&#160;&#160; </b>Critical accounting policies are defined
as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which
potentially could result in materially different accounting under different
assumptions and conditions. We have prepared the accompanying financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following
critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of these financial
statements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Passenger Revenue Recognition</u>.</i>
As discussed in Note 2(c) "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -
Airline Revenues" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>,
passenger ticket sales are recorded as operating revenues when the transportation
is provided. The value of unused passenger tickets is included in current
liabilities as advance ticket sales. Additionally, we have interline agreements
with numerous other airlines whereby the other airline sells tickets for
future use on United and vice versa. Estimated settlement values in accordance
with the interline agreements reached with other airlines are recorded
as operating revenues at the time the ticket is used on United. Adjustments
between the estimated and actual values for interline tickets are recorded
in the period the actual settlement occurs.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Accounting for Long-Lived
Assets.</u></i> We have approximately $13.2 billion in net book value of
operating property and equipment at December 31, 2005. In addition to the
original cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number
of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives
and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment
charges.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We record aircraft at acquisition
cost. Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as
reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated
lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. Older generation aircraft
are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of
United and the practice of other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved,
useful life has increased and we have generally estimated the lives of
those aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on historical
experience with regards to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts, and
are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related
fleets. Residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft
are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the
end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual values
are revised periodically to recognize changes in our fleet plan and other
relevant information. A one year increase in the average depreciable life
of our aircraft would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately
$14 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our policy is to recognize
an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted
future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is
the difference between the asset's book value and fair market value (sometimes
estimated using appraisals). More often, we estimate the undiscounted future
cash flows for our various aircraft with financial models used by the Company
to make fleet and scheduling decisions. These models utilize projections
on passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors.
Changes in our projections expose the Company to future impairment charges
by raising the threshold which future cash flows need to meet.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 2005 and 2003, this process
resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $18 million and $26
million, respectively, for the early retirement of certain aircraft. See
Note 3, "Special Items" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; See Note 2(f), "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies - Operating Property and Equipment" in
the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u> for additional information
regarding United's policies on accounting for long-lived assets.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Frequent Flyer Accounting.</u></i>
United's Mileage Plus frequent flyer program awards mileage credits to
passengers who fly on United, Ted, United Express, the Star Alliance carriers
and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Additionally,
United sells mileage credits to participating airline partners in the Mileage
Plus program and ULS sells mileage credits to non-airline business partners.
In any case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on United,
or any airline that participates in the program (in which case, United
pays a designated amount to reimburse the transporting carrier). The Company
has an obligation to provide this future travel; therefore, we recognize
a liability and corresponding expense for mileage earned by passengers
who flew on United, Ted, United Express, Star Alliance partners, or one
of the Mileage Plus airline partners. For miles earned by members through
non-airline business partners, a portion of revenue from the sale of mileage
is deferred and recognized when the transportation is provided.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, our
estimated outstanding number of awards to be issued against earned and
outstanding mileage credits was approximately 10.1 million, compared to
10.2 million for December 31, 2004. We currently estimate that approximately
8.3 million of these awards will ultimately be redeemed and, accordingly,
have recorded a liability of $923 million, which includes the deferred
revenue from the sale of miles to non-airline business partners. We utilize
a number of estimates in accounting for the Mileage Plus program that require
management judgment as discussed below.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Members may not reach the
threshold necessary for a free ticket award and outstanding miles may not
always be redeemed for free travel. Therefore, based on historical data
and other information, we estimate how many miles will never be used for
an award and exclude those miles from our estimate of the Company's liability.
We also estimate the average number of miles that will be used to redeem
an award, which can vary depending upon member choices from alternative
award categories. If average actual miles used per award redeemed are more
or less than previously estimated, we must subsequently adjust the liability
and corresponding expense.&#160;&#160; A hypothetical 1% change in our
estimate of breakage, currently estimated at 18%, has approximately a $3.5
million effect on the liability.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When a travel award level
is attained by a Mileage Plus member, we record a liability for the estimated
incremental cost to United of providing the related future travel, based
on expected redemption. For award redemptions expected to occur on United,
United's incremental costs are estimated to include variable items such
as fuel, meals, insurance and ticketing costs, for what would otherwise
be a vacant seat. The estimate of incremental costs does not include any
indirect costs or contribution to overhead or profit. A change to these
cost estimates, such as a significant change in jet fuel prices, could
have a significant impact on our liability in the year of change as well
as in future years, since underlying variable cost factors can differ significantly
from period to period. A hypothetical 1% change in the cost of jet fuel
has approximately a $783 thousand effect on the liability.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 2005, 1.9 million Mileage
Plus travel awards were used on United, as compared to 1.7 million awards
used in 2004, and 2.0 million in 2003. This number represents the number
of awards for which travel was actually provided and not the number of
available seats that were allocated to award travel. These awards represented
6.6% of United's total revenue passenger miles in 2005, 7.4% in 2004, and
9.0% in 2003. Passenger preference for Saver awards, which have stringent
seat inventory level limitations but require the use of fewer miles to
redeem the award, keeps the potential displacement of revenue passengers
on United by award travel at a lower level than would be the case for less
restrictive awards. Total miles redeemed for travel on United in 2005,
including travel awards and class-of-service upgrades, represented 79%
of the total miles redeemed, of which 70% were used for travel within the
U.S. and Canada.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition to the awards
issued for travel on United, approximately 21% of the total miles redeemed
in 2005 were used for travel on partner airlines, such as Star Alliance
members. In these cases, United estimates its liability based upon agreements
with those partner airlines that specify reimbursement rates for those
awards using a 12.5% historical redemption pattern of awards redeemed on
partner airlines. Costs to United for awards issued on partner airlines
are on average much higher than incremental costs of awards issued for
travel on United. Therefore, a change in customer preference from redeeming
awards on United to redeeming them on partner airlines can significantly
increase the estimated cost of mileage credit obligations. A hypothetical
1% change in the redemption of awards on partner airlines has approximately
an $8.3 million effect on the liability.
</p><p>On March 7, 2006, United announced that Mileage Plus elite members were
eligible for merchandise rewards which offer a more diverse array of mileage-reward
opportunities. This offer expands mileage awards beyond flights, hotel
stays, dining certificates, car rentals and auction experiences, to include
brand-name online merchandise. This could have a potential impact on the
Company's liability if the average number of miles that will be used to
redeem an award is reduced as members elect to redeem miles for the merchandising
options. Non-air redemptions have typically been immaterial in the past
and we cannot accurately predict the redemption behavior and therefore
are unable to estimate the impact on our future liability.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><u>Pension Accounting.</u></i>&#160;
The Company accounts for pension benefits using SFAS No. 87, "<i>Employers'
Accounting for Pensions</i>" ("SFAS No. 87"). Under SFAS No. 87, pension
expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees' approximate service
periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions
or requirements. Detailed information regarding our pension plans is included
in Note 15, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements</u>. The calculation of pension expense and pension
obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the
assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The fair
value of plan assets decreased from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2004 to
$132 million at December 31, 2005. The terminations of the domestic defined
benefit pension plans reduced the difference between the plans' fair value
and accumulated benefit obligations from $6.4 billion at December 31, 2004
to $109 million at December 31, 2005.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We utilized a weighted-average
discount rate of 5.46% at December 31, 2005, compared to 5.84% at December
31, 2004 and 6.25% at December 31, 2003. The discount rates were based
on the construction of theoretical bond portfolios for 2005 and 2004, andMoody's
Aa bond index yield model for 2003, adjusted according to the timing of
expected cash flows for our future pension obligations. Duration is a commonly
used measure of interest rate risk that either assumes that yield changes
do not change the expected cash flows ("modified duration") or assumes
that expected cash flows may change given the fact that the yield changes
("effective duration"). Since United's pension obligations have generally
not been satisfied in single lump sum distributions, management, with assistance
from our actuary, used the modified duration methodology to determine an
acceptable discount rate by matching the expected cash outflows of our
pension obligations against available bonds with appropriate maturities.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We assumed an expected rate
of return on plan assets of 8.95%, 9.00% and 9.00%, respectively, at December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The expected return on plan assets is based on
an evaluation of the historical behavior of the broad financial markets
and the Company's investment portfolio, taking into consideration input
from the plans' investment consultant and actuary regarding expected long-term
market conditions and investment management performance. We believe that
the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted
allocation and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically
rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate.
Pension expense is reduced by the expected return on plan assets, which
is measured by assuming the market-related value of plan assets increases
at the expected rate of return. The market-related value is a calculated
value that phases in differences between the expected rate of return and
the actual return over a period of five years.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Actuarial gains or losses
are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from
the original assumptions. Under SFAS No. 87, those gains and losses are
not required to be recognized currently as pension expense, but instead
may be deferred. If the unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the
greater of the projected benefit obligations and the market-related value
of plan assets, the amount outside the 10% corridor is subject to amortization
over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees.
At December 31, 2005, we had unrecognized actuarial losses of $38 million.
</p><p><i><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b><u>Valuation Allowance for
Deferred Tax Assets.</u></i> We initially recorded a tax valuation allowance
against our deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2002. In recording
the valuation allowance, management considered whether it was more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized.
This analysis included consideration of scheduled reversals of deferred
tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carry back potential
and tax planning strategies, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "<i>Accounting
for Income Taxes</i>." At December 31, 2005, our valuation allowance totaled
$10.6 billion. See also Note 6, "Income Taxes" in the
<u>Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements</u> for additional information.

For detailed information, see Note 2(n), "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies - New Accounting Pronouncements" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p><b><u>Outlook</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United expects system mainline
capacity to be up approximately 1.0 percent year-over-year for the first
quarter, and up approximately 2.5 to 3.0 percent for the full year 2006
over 2005, driven by improved aircraft utilization through the Company's
resource optimization effort.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company expects mainline
fuel price, including taxes and expected hedge impact, for the first quarter
to average $1.95 per gallon, and for the full-year to average $1.94 per
gallon. The Company has 32% of its expected mainline fuel consumption for
the first quarter hedged at an average of $1.91 per gallon. Currently,
the Company has no hedges in place beyond first quarter of 2006. The Company
expects to be able to offset some, but not all, of increased fuel prices
through higher revenues.

</p><p><b>ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Interest Rate and Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risks - </b>United's exposure to market risk associated
with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations
and short-term investments. We do not use derivative financial instruments
in our investment portfolio. Our policy is to manage interest rate risk
through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and entering into
swap agreements, depending upon market conditions. A portion of our borrowings
is denominated in foreign currencies that expose us to risks associated
with changes in foreign exchange rates. To hedge against some of this risk,
we have placed foreign currency deposits (primarily for euros) to meet
foreign currency lease obligations denominated in those respective currencies.
Since unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on the foreign currency
deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations,
we reduce our overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility.
The fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value
of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate. The fair value of
long-term debt is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues or the present value of future cash flows using a U.S. Treasury
rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument, adjusted by a credit
spread.

<p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b> In the first quarter
of 2006, United entered into an interest rate swap whereby it fixed the
rate of interest on $2.45 billion notional value of floating-rate debt
at 5.14% plus a fixed credit margin. The swap will amortize according to
a pre-established schedule starting in November 2007 through its expected
maturity date of February 2012.

</p><p><b>ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</b>
</p><p>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
</p><p>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
<br/>UAL Corporation
<br/>Elk Grove Township, Illinois
</p><p>We have audited the accompanying statements of consolidated financial
position of UAL Corporation (Debtor-In-Possession) and subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related statements
of consolidated operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005.&#160; Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item
15. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company's management.&#160; Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
</p><p>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&#160; Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.&#160;
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.&#160;
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</p><p>In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of UAL Corporation (Debtor-in-Possession)
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.
</p><p>As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, on January 20, 2006,
the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization
which became effective after the close of business on February 1, 2006.
Under the plan of reorganization, the Company is required to comply with
certain terms and conditions as more fully described in Note 1.
</p><p>We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated March 30, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Considerations</i></b>.&#160;&#160; The following discussion provides general
background information regarding our Chapter 11 cases, and is not intended
to be an exhaustive summary. Detailed information pertaining to our bankruptcy
filings may be obtained at <u>www.pd-ual.com.</u></font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On December
9, 2002 (the "Petition Date"), UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions to
reorganize their businesses under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of
Illinois, Eastern Division (the "Bankruptcy Court"). On October 20, 2005,
the Debtors filed the Debtor's First Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization
Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the First
Amended Disclosure Statement for Reorganizing Debtors' Joint Plan of Reorganization
Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Disclosure
Statement"). On October 21, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Disclosure
Statement.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Commencing
on October 27, 2005, the Disclosure Statement, ballots for voting to accept
or reject the proposed plan of reorganization and other solicitation documents
were distributed to all classes of creditors eligible to vote on the proposed
plan of reorganization. On January 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed
the Debtors' Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Plan of Reorganization").
The Plan of Reorganization became effective and the Debtors emerged from
bankruptcy protection on February 1, 2006 (the "Effective Date"). On the
Effective Date, UAL implemented fresh start accounting in accordance with
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position
90-7 "<i>Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code</i>" ("SOP 90-7"). See Note 20, "Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance Sheet
(Unaudited)".</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Plan of
Reorganization generally provides for the full payment or reinstatement
of allowed administrative claims, priority claims, and secured claims,
and the distribution of new equity securities to the Debtors' creditors,
employees and others in satisfaction of allowed unsecured claims. The Plan
of Reorganization contemplates UAL issuing up to 125 million shares (out
of the one billion shares of new common stock authorized under its certificate
of incorporation). The new common stock was listed on the NASDAQ National
Market and began trading under the symbol "UAUA" on February 2, 2006. The
distributions of common stock, subject to certain holdbacks as described
in the Plan of Reorganization, will generally be made as follows:</font>
<br/>&#160;
</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">Approximately 115 million shares of common stock to unsecured
creditors and employees,</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">Up to 9.825 million shares of common stock and options (or
rights to acquire shares) under the management equity incentive plan ("MEIP")
approved by the Bankruptcy Court, and</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">Up to 175,000 shares of common stock and options (or rights
to acquire shares) under the director equity incentive plan ("DEIP") approved
by the Bankruptcy Court.</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><br/><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Plan
of Reorganization also provides for the issuance of the following debt
and equity securities:</font>
<br/>&#160;
</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">5,000,000 shares of 2% convertible preferred stock, which
were issued to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") shortly
after the Effective Date;</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">Approximately $150 million in aggregate principal amount
of convertible 5% notes, which were issued to holders of certain municipal
bonds shortly after the Effective Date;</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">Approximately $726 million in aggregate principal amount
of additional convertible notes, which are issuable within the first six
months after the Effective Date to employees;</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">$500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6% senior unsecured
notes, which were issued to the PBCG shortly after the Effective Date;
and</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">$500 million in aggregate principal amount of 8% senior unsecured
notes (in up to eight equal tranches of $62.5 million) issuable to the
PBGC subject to the satisfaction of certain contingencies.</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><br/><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pursuant
to the Plan of Reorganization, UAL common stock, preferred stock and Trust
Originated Preferred Securities ("TOPrS") issued prior to the Petition
Date were canceled on the Effective Date, and no distribution will be made
to holders of those securities.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On the Effective
Date, the Company secured access to up to $3.0 billion in exit financing
(the "Credit Facility") which consists of a $2.8 billion term loan and
a $200 million revolving credit line. On the Effective Date, $2.45 billion
of the $2.8 billion term loan and the entire revolving credit line was
drawn and used to repay the Debtor-In-Possession credit facility (the "DIP
Financing") and to make other payments required upon exit from bankruptcy,
as well as to provide ongoing liquidity to conduct post-reorganization
operations. Subsequently, the Company repaid $161 million on the revolving
credit line and accessed the remaining $350 million on the term loan.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Until recently,
the Company had an ongoing dispute with respect to a group of mostly-public
financiers (the "Public Debt Group") involving 14 aircraft financed under
the Series 1997-1 Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates ("1997-1 EETC").
In August 2005, United provided notice to the 1997-1 EETC trustee of its
intention to purchase the Tranche A certificates, which would permit it
to secure long-term access to the 14 aircraft subject to that financing.&#160;
The Company previously had acquired the 1997-1 EETC Tranche B and Tranche
C certificates in a market transaction as a precursor to utilizing the
transaction par buyout mechanism to purchase the Tranche A certificates.
However, a dispute arose between the Company and the holders of the Tranche
A certificates regarding the amount necessary to pay the current certificate
holders in full, and that matter was the subject of litigation.&#160; On
March 17, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Company's
settlement with the Public Debt Group in connection with the 1997-1 EETC
transaction. The settlement resolves all pending litigation in connection
with the 1997-1 EETC transaction and aircraft and provides for a permanent
mutual release of all related claims. On March 20, 2006, the Company remitted
$281 million to the 1997-1 EETC trustee as final payment for the Tranche
A certificates. The Company refinanced the 14 aircraft with the $350 million
term loan provided under the Credit Facility.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Significant Matters
Remaining to be Resolved in Bankruptcy Court.&#160; </i></b>During the
course of our Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company successfully reached
settlements with most of its creditors and resolved most pending claims
against the Debtors. However, the following material matters remain to
be resolved in the Bankruptcy Court:</font>
</p><blockquote><font size="+0">(a)&#160; In August 2005, United entered into
term sheets to restructure the financings for all of the aircraft in United's
fleet that are controlled by the Public Debt Group, excluding the 1997-1
EETC discussed above.&#160; As of the Effective Date, definitive documentation
was not yet complete on the restructurings contemplated by the term sheets.&#160;
With respect to the pre-1997 transactions financing 19 aircraft, we have
subsequently closed transactions covering 18 of the 19 aircraft. We have
reached agreement on all business terms associated with the last aircraft
and we anticipate closing shortly after other technical documentation has
been executed. With respect to the three post-1997 Enhanced Equipment Trust
Certificate transactions, financing 80 aircraft, there is a dispute with
respect to interpretation of the term sheet as to the circumstances under
which the Company can repay the obligations in advance of the maturity
dates.&#160; This dispute has prevented United from closing these transactions.&#160;
All of the Public Debt Group term sheets provide that in the event the
Company and the trustees did not execute definitive documentation prior
to United exiting from Chapter 11 and the parties did not extend the date
by which definitive documentation had to be completed, the restructured
transactions would be unwound.&#160; On January 31, 2006, the Bankruptcy
Court ruled in United's favor and ordered an extension of the date by which
definitive documentation must be completed to February 9, 2006 which was
subsequently extended to March 24, 2006. The parties have requested an
evidentiary hearing, which will take place at the end of April 2006. The
parties are currently negotiating another extension of the date by which
definitive documentation must be finalized. United cannot accurately predict
the outcome of this litigation, and it could potentially have a material
adverse impact on the Company.</font>
<p><font size="+0">(b)&#160; We are a party to numerous long-term agreements
to lease certain airport and maintenance facilities that are financed through
tax-exempt municipal bonds that are issued by various local municipalities
to build or improve airport and maintenance facilities. During 2003, we
filed four complaints for declaratory judgment and corresponding motions
for temporary restraining orders concerning United's municipal bond obligations
for facilities at Denver International Airport ("DEN"), John F. Kennedy
International Airport ("JFK"), San Francisco International Airport ("SFO"),
and Los Angeles International Airport ("LAX"). In each case, we sought
clarification of our obligations to pay principal and interest under the
applicable municipal bonds, and the protection of our rights concerning
related airport lease agreements at the applicable airports. With respect
to SFO, LAX and JFK, the Bankruptcy Court ruled in United's favor. With
respect to DEN, the Bankruptcy Court ruled against United. The Bankruptcy
Court's rulings with respect to each of the four matters were subsequently
appealed to the District Court. The District Court reversed the Bankruptcy
Court's rulings with respect to SFO and LAX but upheld the Bankruptcy Court's
rulings with respect to JFK and DEN. All four of the District Court's rulings
in turn were<b> </b>appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit (the "Court of Appeals"). The Court of Appeals reversed
the District Court's ruling against the Company with respect to the SFO
adversary proceeding and the SFO defendants' petition for a rehearing was
denied. The defendants in the SFO matter petitioned the United States Supreme
Court for a writ of certiorari on November 18, 2005, which was denied on
March 6, 2006. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ruling
in our favor with respect to the JFK adversary proceeding. The defendants
in the JFK matter filed a petition for rehearing with the Court of Appeals
in September 2005, which was denied by the Court of Appeals. The time for
filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the JFK matter has expired.
With respect to the DEN and LAX appeals, briefing has now been completedand
the Court of Appeals heard oral argument in February 2006. The Court of
Appeals, however, has not yet ruled on these matters. The outcome of theLAX
and DEN appeals remains uncertain and, therefore, the ultimate treatment
of these municipal bond obligations is uncertain.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">(c)&#160; Similarly, in September 2003, we filed a complaint
for declaratory judgment for all seven municipal bond issues (which represent
approximately $601 million in principal) relating to our facilities at
O'Hare, seeking, among other things, a declaration that a certain cross-default
provision in the O'Hare airport lease is unenforceable. In February 2005,
the Bankruptcy Court approved an agreement ("O'Hare Settlement Agreement")
resolving the disputes between United, the trustees and the bondholders.
The City of Chicago, a party to these adversary proceedings, is not a party
to the O'Hare Settlement Agreement. In August 2005, the Company announced
that it had reached an agreement in principle with the City of Chicago,
with respect to all unresolved disputes relating to our facilities at O'Hare.
However, the parties were unable to finalize the terms of this settlement.
The City of Chicago maintained that it could revoke United's exclusive
rights to terminals in place of "preferential" rights if United did not
meet the terms of the cross-default provision (the O'Hare Airport Use Agreement
did not define or provide for any usage rights, other than exclusive rights).
United responded that the cross-default provision was unenforceable against
a debtor in bankruptcy as provided under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code, and thus United should retain its exclusive rights at O'Hare. On
October 5, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court held a one day trial to determine
certain evidentiary issues underlying a determination of whether the cross-default
provision was enforceable. The parties subsequently completed post-trial
briefing and the Court is set to issue a ruling on this issue at the April
2006 omnibus hearing.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">(d)&#160; HSBC Bank Inc. ("HSBC"), as trustee for the
1997 special facility bonds related to SFO, filed a complaint against United
asserting a security interest in United's lease for portions of its maintenance
base at SFO. Pursuant to Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, HSBC alleges
that it is entitled to be paid the value of that security interest. United
denies these allegations. HSBC and United are engaged in discovery and
are preparing for trial at the end of April 2006.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">(e)&#160; Despite our emergence from Chapter 11 protection,
many unsecured proofs of claim remain unresolved. Since the Effective Date
and in accordance with the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, United
has continued to review the claims register and the Company believes that
many of the filed proofs of claim are invalid, untimely, duplicative, or
overstated, and therefore is in the process of objecting to such claims.
Differences between claim amounts filed and our estimates of claims to
be allowed are being investigated and will be resolved in connection with
our claims resolution process. In this regard, it should be noted that
the claims reconciliation process may result in material adjustments after
the Effective Date.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">(f)&#160; In December 2004, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC") filed an Involuntary Termination Proceeding ("Involuntary
Termination Proceeding") against United, as plan administrator for the
United Airlines Pilot Defined Benefit Pension Plan (the "Pilot Plan"),
in the District Court. In January 2005, the District Court granted a motion
filed by the Company and referred the Involuntary Termination Proceeding
to the Bankruptcy Court. ALPA and the United Retired Pilots Benefit Protection
Association and seven retired pilots (collectively, "URPBPA") were later
granted leave to intervene in the Involuntary Termination Proceeding.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">After several months, the PBGC moved for summary judgment
based on the administrative record which was partially granted by the Bankruptcy
Court. In addition, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that if grounds existed
for termination, the termination date would be December 30, 2004. However,
the Bankruptcy Court denied the PBGC's motion for summary judgment as to
the propriety of terminating the Pilot Plan. Later, in September 2005,
the Bankruptcy Court conducted a trial and determined that the Pilot Plan
should be involuntarily terminated under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act ("ERISA") Section 4042. On October 26, 2005, the Bankruptcy
Court issued a memorandum opinion in the PBGC's favor finding that the
Pilot Plan should be terminated. On October 28, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court
entered an order authorizing termination of the Pilot Plan.</font></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="+0">The PBGC, ALPA and URPBPA filed notices of appeal
and in February 2006, the District Court reversed the Bankruptcy Court's
order based on a determination that the Bankruptcy Court lacked "core"
jurisdiction over the Involuntary Termination Proceeding. However, the
District Court did not address the substantive merits of the Bankruptcy
Court's ruling. The District Court remanded the proceedings to the Bankruptcy
Court so that the Bankruptcy Court could submit proposed findings and conclusions
of law to be forwarded to the District Court for review, which has since
happened. The District Court's determination (and that of any court considering
an appeal of the District Court's order) regarding the termination of the
Pilot Plan may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
performance.</font>
<p><font size="+0">(g)&#160; After the PBGC commenced its Involuntary Termination
Proceeding and sought a December 30, 2004 termination date, the Company
suspended ALPA non-qualified pension benefits pending the setting of such
a termination date. On February 18, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court required
the Company to continue paying non-qualified pension benefits to retired
pilots pending a termination in the Involuntary Termination Proceeding,
notwithstanding the possibility that the Pilot Plan might be terminated
retroactive to December 30, 2004. Then, on October 6, 2005, the Bankruptcy
Court required the Company to continue paying non-qualified pension benefits
until entry of the Bankruptcy Court's order and accompanying memorandum
opinion terminating the Pilot Plan which was appealed by the Company. On
February 24, 2006, the District Court dismissed the Company's appeal of
the October 6, 2005 order compelling payment of non-qualified pension benefits
in light of its February 2006 decision reversing the Bankruptcy Court's
Termination Order. Subsequently, on March 17, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court
ruled that the Company was obligated to make payment of non-qualified pension
benefits through January 31, 2006. The Bankruptcy Court also ruled that
the Company's obligation to pay non-qualified pension benefits ceased as
of January 31, 2006. The Company continues to review the impact of the
Bankruptcy Court's latest decision.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">(h)&#160; In January 2005, United filed a motion seeking
approval of the new CBA with ALPA pursuant to Section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code. The Bankruptcy Court approved the ALPA agreement over the objections
of various parties. The active pilots ratified the agreement, and the Bankruptcy
Court entered an order approving the ALPA agreement (the "ALPA Order").
In February 2005, URPBPA filed its notice of appeal of the ALPA Order based
principally on the allegation that United was unfairly treating the retired
pilots by not distributing the same unsecured notes to the retired pilots
that it was distributing to the active pilots pursuant to the ALPA agreement.
In June 2005, the District Court entered an order and memorandum opinion
dismissing URPBPA's appeal of the ALPA Order as interlocutory. URPBPA appealed
the District Court's judgment to the Court of Appeals. The parties fully
briefed the matter and the Court of Appeals heard oral argument in February
2006, though it has not yet ruled on the matter. Additionally, the Company
filed with the Court of Appeals a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground
that (i) no effective relief can be granted to the appellants and/or (ii)
if relief could be granted, it would be highly inequitable to do so. The
Court of Appeals has not yet ruled on the Company's motion to dismiss or
indicated whether it will hear further argument on the matter.</font>
</p><p><font size="+0">(i)&#160; Two parties filed notices of appeal of the order
confirming the Plan of Reorganization. First, URPBPA filed its notice of
appeal and its brief in support of the appeal of the confirmation order
to the District Court. United filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on March
28, 2006. At a status hearing on March 29, 2006, the District Court ordered
a briefing schedule that combines both the merits of the appeal with United's
request to dismiss the appeal. Pursuant to that schedule, United will have
until April 19, 2006 to file a brief that responds to URPBPA on the merits
of the appeal and requests the District Court to dismiss the appeal. URPBPA
will then have until May 3, 2006 to file a brief that replies to United's
brief on the merits and responds to United's request for dismissal. Finally,
United will have until May 17, 2006 to file a reply to URPBPA in support
of its request for dismissal. The District Court set June 22, 2006 for
the next status hearing in this matter at which time a ruling may be made.
If the confirmation order was ultimately reversed on appeal, it could have
a materially adverse effect on the Company. Second, Wells Fargo Bank Northwest,
N.A., not individually but in its capacity as a trustee ("Wells Fargo"),
filed its notice of appeal of the confirmation order to the District Court.
At the initial status hearing on Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, N.A.'s appeal,
United represented to the District Court that the appeal likely would be
resolved in connection with the parties' agreement to settle the 1997-1
EETC litigation. As such, the District Court continued the status hearing
on Wells Fargo's appeal until April 20, 2006. United expects that the parties
will file a stipulation agreeing to voluntarily dismiss the appeal on or
prior to March 31, 2006 and in any event prior to the April 20, 2006 status
hearing.</font></p></blockquote>
<p><br/><b><i>Claims Resolution Process.</i></b>&#160; As permitted under
the bankruptcy process, our creditors filed proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy
Court. Through the claims resolution process, we identified many claims
which were disallowed by the Bankruptcy Court for a number of reasons,
such as claims that were duplicative, amended or superseded by later filed
claims, were without merit, or were otherwise overstated. Throughout the
bankruptcy, we filed omnibus objections to many of these claims and will
continue to file additional objections. Once we determine an unsecured
claim to be valid, either through the Bankruptcy Court process or through
other means, the claimant is entitled to a distribution of equity as noted
above.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Bankruptcy Court confirmed
and established January 20, 2006 as the record date for purposes of establishing
the persons that are claimholders of record to receive distributions in
accordance with the terms of the Plan of Reorganization. Since February
2, 2006, the first distribution date established in the Plan of Reorganization,
approximately 93<b> </b>million shares of the 115 million shares authorized
by the Plan of Reorganization with respect to such claims have been distributed
to unsecured creditors. Due to the significant volume of claims filed to
date, it is premature to estimate with any degree of accuracy the ultimate
allowed amount of such claims under the Plan of Reorganization. The Plan
of Reorganization stated a range for total unsecured claims of $22-$35
billion. The Company has more recently estimated, however, that the probable
range of unsecured claims to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court will be
$28-$31 billion. Differences between claim amounts filed and our estimates
are being investigated and will be resolved in connection with our claims
resolution process. In this regard, it should be noted that the claims
reconciliation process may result in material adjustments.

<p><b><font size="-1">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </font></b>The
Company determined in late 2004 that it would be necessary to terminate
and replace all of its domestic defined benefit pension plans. To this
end, in April 2005, United and the PBGC entered into a global settlement
agreement which provides for the settlement and compromise of various disputes
and controversies with respect to four defined benefit pension plans of
United, including the Pilot Plan, the United Airlines Flight Attendant
Defined Benefit Plan (the "Flight Attendant Plan"), the United Airlines,
Inc. Ground Employees' Retirement Plan (the "Ground Plan") and the United
Airlines Management, Administrative and Public Contact Defined Benefit
Pension Plan (the "MAPC Plan") (collectively, the "Pension Plans"). In
May 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement agreement, including
modifications requested by certain creditors.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Upon termination and settlement
of the Pension Plans, the Company recognized non-cash curtailment charges
of $640 million and $152 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, and net
settlement losses of approximately $1.1 billion in 2005 in accordance with
SFAS No. 88, "<i>Employer's Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits" </i>("SFAS
88"). Further, the Company recognized a non-cash charge of $7.2 billion
related to a final settlement with the PBGC as a result of the termination
of the defined benefit pension plans.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the global settlement
agreement, the Company provided in its confirmed Plan of Reorganization
for the distribution of the following consideration to the PBGC:
</p><ul>
<li>
$500 million in principal amount of 6% senior unsecured notes to be issued
to the PBGC no later than the Effective Date; maturing 25 years from issuance
date; with interest payable in kind (notes or common stock) through 2011
(and thereafter in cash) in semi-annual installments; and being callable
at any time at 100% of par value.</li>
<li>
5,000,000 shares of 2% convertible preferred stock to be issued to the
PBGC no later than the Effective Date, at a liquidation value of $100 per
share, convertible at any time following the second anniversary of the
issuance date into common stock of the reorganized Company at a conversion
price equal to 125% of the average closing price of the common stock during
the first 60 trading days following exit from bankruptcy; with dividends
payable in kind semi-annually; the preferred stock will rank pari passu
with all current and future UAL or United preferred stock; and will be
redeemable at any time at $100 par value at the option of the issuer; and
will be non-transferable until two years after the issuance date.</li>
<li>
$500 million in principal amount of 8% senior unsecured notes contingently
issuable to the PBGC in up to eight equal tranches of $62.5 million (with
no more than two tranches issued on a single date), no later than 45 days
following the end of any fiscal year starting with the fiscal year 2009
and ending with the fiscal year 2017 in which there is an issuance trigger
date. An issuance trigger date occurs when, among other things, the Company's
EBITDAR exceeds $3.5 billion over the prior twelve months ending June 30
or December 31 of any applicable fiscal year. However, if the issuance
of a tranche would cause a default under any other securities then existing,
the Company may satisfy its obligations with respect to such tranche by
issuing common stock having a market value equal to $62.5 million. Each
issued tranche will mature 15 years from its respective issuance date;
with interest payable in cash in semi-annual installments; and will be
callable at any time at 100% of par value.</li>
</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The PBGC assumed responsibility
for the Ground Plan effective May 23, 2005, the Flight Attendant and the
MAPC Plans effective June 30, 2005 and the Pilot Plan effective October
26, 2005, and the Company has no further duties or rights with respect
to the Pension Plans, subject to the outcome of the matters being considered
by the District Court as more fully described above under "Significant
Matters to be Resolved in Bankruptcy Court." On March 17, 2006, the Bankruptcy
Court ruled that the Company's obligations regarding non-qualified benefits
that were earned under the Pilot Plan ceased January 31, 2006 (representing
approximately $72 million of payments annually).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company provided the
PBGC with a single pre-petition general unsecured claim arising from the
termination of the Pension Plans. The Company and the PBGC entered into
a global settlement agreement, which, among other things, provided that
the PBGC would assign 45% of its claim to certain other creditors. In accordance
with the global settlement agreement, a portion of the shares of common
stock issued in satisfaction of this assigned 45% unsecured claim were
sold in ordinary trading transactions over the NASDAQ National Market,
and the proceeds were distributed to satisfy certain obligations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In exchange for employees'
contributions to the successful reorganization of the Company, including
agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, the Company agreed in the Plan
of Reorganization to provide each employee group a deemed claim which was
used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized
entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim
amount based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided by that
group through reductions to pay and benefits as well as through certain
work rule changes. The total value of this deemed claim was approximately
$7.4 billion. As of December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a non-cash
reorganization charge of $6.5 billion for the deemed claim amount for all
union-represented employees. The remaining $0.9 billion associated with
non-represented salaried and management employees was recorded as a reorganization
charge in January 2006, upon confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Aircraft claim charges include
the Company's estimate of claims incurred as a result of the rejection
of certain aircraft leases and return of aircraft as part of the bankruptcy
process, together with certain claims resulting from the modification of
other aircraft financings in bankruptcy.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As we restructured aircraft
financings as permitted by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, our policy
was to reflect the revised lease rates in aircraft rent once we had signed
definitive term sheets for the financings and they had been approved by
the Bankruptcy Court.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Municipal bond obligations
include the Company's best estimate of unsecured claims incurred as a result
of certain restructured municipal bond obligations, together with certain
claims expected to result from the rejection and litigation of other municipal
bond obligations. The ultimate disposition of several bond obligations
remains subject to the uncertain outcome of pending litigation, and therefore
the claims amounts recorded for those obligations remain subject to change.
In recognition of this and other claims contingencies which remain unresolved
as of the Effective Date, the Company has withheld a portion of the equity
distribution to unsecured creditors and other claimants. See "Claims Resolution
Process" and "Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in Bankruptcy
Court" above for further details.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Contract rejection charges
are non-cash costs that include our estimate of unsecured claims resulting
from the Company's rejection of certain contract obligations such as executory
contracts, unexpired leases, and regional carrier contracts. A portion
of these claim amounts remain subject to future adjustment arising from
negotiated settlements, actions of the Bankruptcy Court, the determination
as to the value of any collateral securing claims, proofs of claim or other
events. See "Claims Resolution Process" above for further details.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 2004, the Company reached
agreement with representatives of our retirees to modify medical and life
insurance benefits for individuals who had retired from United prior to
July of 2003, as provided under Section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code ("retiree
welfare benefit claims"). As a result, the Company proposed, as part of
the approved Plan of Reorganization, a general unsecured claim for these
changes to retiree benefits for each of the eligible individuals. The aggregate
amount of retiree welfare benefit claims allowed by the Bankruptcy Court
pursuant to these agreements and the Company's confirmed Plan of Reorganization
was approximately $652 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2005, in accordance
with the term sheets reached with the Public Debt Group, the Company agreed
to treat certain 2000-1 EETC certificates that were held by a related party
as canceled for all economic and other purposes. In addition, the Company
determined that certain 1997-1 EETC Tranche D certificates were impaired.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash charge in the amount of $134
million for principal and interest on such canceled and impaired certificates.
In addition, the Company recorded adjustments retroactively for aircraft
rent and interest expense in the amount of $60 million to reflect other
revised terms of these financings.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2003, we renegotiated
certain off-balance sheet leases subject to Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Under the terms of the revised leases, we surrendered our investment
in the junior portion of the original lease debt to the original equity
participant. As a result, our investment in the corresponding lease certificates
was reduced to zero, resulting in a $223 million non-cash charge to reorganization
expense.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The <u>Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position</u> distinguish pre-petition liabilities subject to
compromise from both those pre-petition liabilities that are not subject
to compromise and from post-petition liabilities. Liabilities subject to
compromise are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy
Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. For further details,
see Note 8, "Liabilities Subject to Compromise".
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition, as a result
of the Chapter 11 filing, the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership,
are subject to uncertainty. The implementation of the Plan of Reorganization
and the adoption of fresh start accounting on February 1, 2006 will materially
change the amounts and classifications of certain assets and liabilities,
as compared to amounts and classifications shown in the historical consolidated
financial statements. For further details on fresh start accounting, see
Note 20, "Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance Sheet (Unaudited)".
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; DIP Financing. </i></b>In
connection with the Chapter 11 filings, the Company arranged DIP Financing.
On July 15, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved an amendment to our agreement
with the DIP Financing lenders to increase the term loan from $800 million
to $1.1 billion which, when combined with a $200 million revolving credit
and letter of credit facility, provided for a total facility of $1.3 billion
(subject to a $100 million reserve for collateral maintenance and liquidation
expenses). The amendment also (i) extended the maturity date and the effectiveness
of financial covenants to December 30, 2005; (ii) gave the Company the
option to further extend the maturity date until March 31, 2006 if certain
conditions were satisfied; (iii) reduced the interest rate to the prime
rate plus 3.25% or LIBOR plus 4.25%; (iv) required the Company to maintain
a minimum unrestricted cash balance of at least $750 million; (v) waived
certain events of default related to certain technical matters; and (vi)
provided for a new capital expenditure basket for certain aircraft purchases,
including a cash sublimit, which required financing for the balance of
the aggregate purchase price of such aircraft.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On August 18, 2005 the Bankruptcy
Court approved a further amendment with the DIP Financing lenders to provide
for, among other things, a waiver of any event of default as a result of
the Company acquiring the Tranche A, Tranche B and Tranche C certificates
under the Series 1997-1 EETC financing covering 14 of our aircraft. The
amendment further provided for a new term loan of up to $350 million (which
would mature at the same time as the remainder of the DIP Financing) to
be used to refinance a majority of the purchase price of those certificates,
available to be drawn through March 31, 2006, subject to satisfaction of
certain conditions. As a result of a dispute between United and the holders
of the Tranche A certificates regarding the purchase price thereof, this
matter was the subject of continuing litigation and the Company was unable
to satisfy the conditions of the DIP agreement permitting the Company to
draw on the new term loan of $350 million. However, during the first quarter
of 2006, the Company was able to reach an agreement with the Tranche A
certificate holders. For further information regarding the resolved litigation
with respect to the 1997-1 EETCs, see "Bankruptcy Considerations."
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The terms of the DIP Financing
included covenants with respect to ongoing monthly financial requirements,
including thresholds for minimum EBITDAR, limitations on capital expenditures
and minimum unrestricted cash. Failure to comply with these covenants would
have constituted an event of default under the DIP Financing and allowed
the lenders to accelerate the loan. The Company complied with the EBITDAR
covenant in the fourth quarter of 2005 and in the first quarter of 2006,
up to the repayment of the DIP Facility with proceeds from the Credit Facility
on the Effective Date.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Borrowing availability was
determined by a formula based on a percentage of the value of eligible
assets. The eligible assets consisted of certain previously unencumbered
aircraft, spare engines, spare parts inventory, certain flight simulators,
quick engine change kits and certain route authorities. The DIP Financing
was guaranteed by UAL and all other filing subsidiaries and was secured
by first priority liens on all unencumbered present and future assets and
by junior liens on all other assets, other than certain specified assets,
including assets which are subject to financing agreements that are entitled
to the benefits of Section 1110, and to the extent such financing agreements
prohibited such junior liens.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December 31, 2005,
we had outstanding borrowings of $1.2 billion at an interest rate of 8.6%.
In addition, letters of credit were issued under the DIP Financing in an
aggregate amount of $39 million. The DIP financing was repaid in full on
the Effective Date, February 1, 2006.
</p><p><b><u>(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</u></b>
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>(a) Basis of Presentation</b></i>
- UAL is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is United. The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of UAL and all of our majority-owned
affiliates. We sometimes collectively refer to UAL Corporation, together
with our consolidated subsidiaries, as "we," "UAL" or the "Company." All
significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the <u>Condensed
Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows</u>, the classification of financing
costs primarily associated with our DIP Financing has been changed from
an investing activity to a financing activity included in "Other, net".
For 2004 and 2003, this change resulted in a $26 million and $68 million
decrease, respectively, to financing cash flows and a corresponding increase
to investing cash flows from amounts previously reported.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i><b>(b) Use of Estimates
</b>-</i>
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (c) Airline Revenues</i>
- </b>We record passenger fares and cargo revenues as operating revenues
when the transportation is provided. -The value of unused passenger tickets
is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. We periodically
evaluate the balance in advance ticket sales and record any adjustments
in the period the evaluation is completed. In addition, we have code-sharing
agreements with other airlines under which one carrier's flights can be
marketed under the two-letter airline designator code of another carrier.
Revenues earned under these arrangements are allocated between the code
share partners based on existing contractual agreements and airline industry
standard prorate formulas and are recognized as passenger revenue when
the transportation is provided.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents
and Short-Term Investments </i></b><i>-</i> Cash in excess of operating
requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing
investments. Investments with a maturity of three months or less on their
acquisition date are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Other investments
are classified as short-term investments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, the
Company had $77 million of investments in debt securities that were classified
as available-for-sale as compared to $10 million at December 31, 2004.
In 2005, United purchased the Tranche B and Tranche C certificates under
the Series 1997-1 EETC. In addition, the Company had investments in debt
securities of $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion, at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively that were classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt
securities classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair value, which
does not differ significantly from their cost basis, based on the quoted
market prices for the securities and other available evidence. Investments
classified as held-to-maturity are stated at cost, which approximates market
due to their short-term maturities. The gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale
securities are included in interest income for each respective year.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company had $643 million
and $877 million classified as short-term restricted cash at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, representing security for worker compensation
obligations, security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions
that process our credit card ticket sales. In addition, the Company had
long-term restricted cash of $314 million at December 31, 2005.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(e) Aircraft Fuel,
Spare Parts and Supplies</i> -</b> Aircraft fuel and maintenance and operating
supplies are stated at average cost. Flight equipment spare parts are stated
at average cost less an obsolescence allowance.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(f) Operating Property
and Equipment</i> -</b> Owned operating property and equipment are stated
at cost. Property under capital leases, and the related obligation for
future lease payments, is recorded at an amount equal to the initial present
value of those lease payments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Depreciation and amortization
of owned depreciable assets is based on the straight-line method over the
assets' estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the remaining term of the lease, including estimated renewal options when
renewal is reasonably assured at key airports, or the estimated service
life of the related asset, whichever is less. Aircraft are depreciated
to estimated salvage values, generally over lives of 25 to 30 years; buildings
are depreciated over lives of 25 to 45 years; and other property and equipment
are depreciated over lives of 3 to 15 years.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Properties under capital
leases are amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease
or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated service lives.
Lease terms are 9 to 18 years for aircraft and 29 years for buildings.
Amortization of capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization
expense.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of minor replacements, are charged to maintenance expense
as incurred, except for costs incurred under our power by the hour engine
maintenance agreements, which are expensed based upon the number of hours
flown. Costs of additions to and renewals of units of property are capitalized
as property and equipment additions.
</p><p><i><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (g) Mileage Plus Awards
</b>-</i>
United's Mileage Plus frequent flyer program awards mileage credits to
passengers who fly on United, Ted, United Express, the Star Alliance carriers
and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Additionally,
United sells mileage credits to participating airline partners in the Mileage
Plus program and ULS sells mileage credits to non-airline business partners.
In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on any
airline that participates in the program.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When a travel award level
is attained by a Mileage Plus member, we record a liability for the estimated
cost of such awards. Our cost includes an estimated incremental cost to
United for future travel redeemed on United, or the contractually determined
amount per award for travel redeemed on other participating airline partners.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Members may not reach the
threshold necessary for a free ticket award and outstanding miles may not
always be redeemed for free travel. Therefore, based on historical data
and other information, we estimate how many miles will never be used for
an award and exclude those miles from our estimate of the Company's liability.
We also estimate the average number of miles that will be used per award,
which can vary depending upon member choices from alternatives.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For miles earned by members
through non-airline business partners, a portion of revenue from the sale
of mileage is deferred over a specified period based upon expected award
usage and recognized when the transportation is provided.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, the
Company had recorded a liability and deferred revenue for its frequent
flyer program totaling $1.6 billion (consisting of $679 million for prepaid
miles and $923 million related to award travel).
</p><p><i><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (h) Deferred Gains
</b>-</i>
Gains on aircraft sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related leases as a reduction of aircraft rent expense.
</p><p><i><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (i) United Express
</b>-</i>
United has capacity and prorate agreements under which independent regional
carriers, flying under the United Express name, connect passengers to other
United Express and/or United flights (the latter of which we also refer
to as "mainline" operations, to distinguish them from United Express regional
operations.)
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We pay United Express regional
carriers operating under capacity agreements on a fee-per-departure basis.
Historically, we have classified the revenues derived from United Express
flights in passenger revenues, after subtracting the associated operating
expenses incurred to operate United Express flights, including the fee-per-departure,
fuel, ground handing and other expense items.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>United Express operating
expenses include both allocated as well as direct costs. Direct costs represent
expenses that are specifically and exclusively related to United Express
flying activities, such as commissions, booking fees, fuel expenses and
dedicated staffing. Allocated costs represent United Express' portion of
shared expenses and include charges for items such as airport operating
costs, reservation-related costs, credit card discount fees and facility
rents. For each of these expense categories, we estimate United Express'
portion of total expense and allocate the applicable portion of expense
to the United Express carrier.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Additionally, contractual
payments made to United Express regional carriers include payments for
aircraft operated by them as part of the United Express agreements. UAL
has the right to exclusively operate and direct the operations of these
aircraft, and accordingly the minimum future lease payments for these United
Express-operated aircraft are included in our lease obligations as described
in Note 10, "Lease Obligations."
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United has call options on
142 regional jet aircraft currently being operated by certain United Express
carriers. These options are intended to allow United to secure control
over regional jets used for United Express flying in certain circumstances.
The conditions under which United can exercise these call options vary
by contract, but include operational performance metrics and in some cases
the financial standing of one or both of the parties. At this time, none
of the call options are exercisable.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (j) Advertising</b> -
Advertising costs, which are included in other operating expenses, are
expensed as incurred. In addition to conventional advertising costs, adjustments
related to changes in the Mileage Plus award liability are recorded as
advertising expense. Advertising expense was $202 million, $250 million
and $190 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (k) Intangibles</i></b>
- Intangibles consist primarily of route acquisition costs and intangible
pension assets (see Note 15, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans").
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; SFAS No. 142, "<i>Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets</i>" requires companies to test intangibles
for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis when a triggering
event occurs. At December 31, 2005, we performed an evaluation of our intangibles
and determined that their fair value remained in excess of the book value.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The following information
relates to our intangibles at December 31, 2005 and 2004:

</table>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Gates are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the related leases. Other intangibles
are amortized over periods of 1 to 13 years. Total amortization expense
recognized was $8 million in 2005, $5 million in 2004 and $8 million in
2003. We would expect to record amortization expense of $6 million in 2006,
$4 million in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009 and $1 million in 2010, with
respect to amortized intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2005.
However, the adoption of fresh start accounting on the Effective Date is
expected to materially change recorded amounts for intangible assets and
amortization expense to be recognized thereon. See Note 20, "Pro Forma
Fresh Start Balance Sheet (Unaudited)".
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2005, we removed the
book value of certain airport gates that were fully-amortized in accordance
with Company policy. This lowered our gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by approximately $6 million. In addition, the Company reclassified
$3 million of other intangibles.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2004, we removed the
book value on certain airport slots that were fully-amortized in accordance
with Company policy. This lowered our gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by approximately $145 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Route authorities are rights
granted by governments to operate flights to and from a particular country.
These authorities are very specific and limited, fixed in nature and are
rarely available in the marketplace. Accordingly, route authorities are
highly valued and sought-after assets by all airlines. We believe the market
value of these assets continues to be in excess of recorded book value.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Gates, like routes, are often
highly valued assets that do not frequently come into the marketplace.
We believe that their market value continues to be in excess of recorded
book value.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (l) Measurement of
Impairments</i></b><font face="Arial"><font size="+0"> -</font></font> We
recognize an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds its
net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount
of the charge is the difference between the asset's carrying value and
fair market value.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (m)&#160; Stock Option
Accounting - </i></b>At December 31, 2005, we had certain stock-based employee
compensation plans, as described in Note 14, "Stock Options and Awards".
We account for these plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, "<i>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees</i>," ("APB 25") and related
Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost for stock options
is reflected in our financial statements as provided under APB 25, as all
options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market
value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Under the Company's
confirmed Plan of Reorganization, these stock options were canceled upon
the Effective Date.
<br/>&#160;
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If compensation cost for
stock-based employee compensation plans had been determined using the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "<i>Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation</i>," we would have reported our net loss and loss per share
as the pro forma amounts indicated below:

New Accounting Pronouncements</i></b> -<b> </b>In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), "<i>Share-Based Payment</i>" ("SFAS 123R")
which establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity
obtains employee services in exchange for stock options or share-based
payments. SFAS 123R requires that the compensation cost (as measured by
the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued) relating
to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements.
This statement replaces SFAS No. 123, and supersedes APB 25. Currently
we account for stock options under APB 25 as permitted by SFAS 123. SFAS
123R is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2006. The Company
will recognize compensation expense for employee participation in stock-based
compensation plans for the portion of outstanding awards for which the
employee service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant date fair
value of those awards calculated under SFAS 123R.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Bankruptcy Court approved
the MEIP and DEIP plans in January 2006, which will be accounted for after
the Effective Date under the provisions of SFAS 123R. The Company distributed
stock awards under the DEIP and MEIP plans in February 2006. The Company
estimates the compensation expense of the MEIP and DEIP programs to be
$67 million for the first quarter of 2006, and $163 million for the calendar
year 2006. This is made up of stock grants, restricted stock, and stock
options. Stock grants and restricted stock awards under these plans are
estimated at approximately $38 million in the first quarter of 2006, and
$90 million for calendar year 2006. The Company has also estimated (using
a Black-Scholes fair value option pricing model) that it will recognize
compensation for stock options awarded under these plans of approximately
$29 million in the first quarter of 2006, and $73 million for the calendar
year 2006. The Company continues to evaluate various option pricing models
to determine the fair value of its options, including the potential use
of lattice or binomial models. Therefore, the Company's actual compensation
expense for stock options may be different from the estimates provided.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In March 2005, the FASB issued
FASB Interpretation No. 47, "<i>Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143"</i> ("FIN47").
FIN47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used
in SFAS No. 143, <i>"Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", </i>and
addresses the diverse accounting practices that have developed with respect
to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated
with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset when the timing and
(or) method of settlement of the obligation are conditional on a future
event. In addition, FIN47 clarifies that an entity is required to recognize
a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation
when incurred if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated.
FIN47 is effective no later than the end of the fiscal year ending December
31, 2005. The Company has determined that the impact on its financial statements
is immaterial.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In May 2005, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 154, "<i>Accounting Changes and Error Corrections" </i>("SFAS
154"). This statement, which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, "<i>Accounting
Changes",</i> and FASB Statement No. 3, "<i>Reporting Accounting Changes
in Interim Financial Statements",</i> requires that a voluntary change
in accounting principle be applied retroactively to all prior period financial
statements presented, unless it is impractical to do so. SFAS 154 also
provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long-lived
non-financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate effected by
a change in accounting principle, and also provides that corrections of
errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a "restatement".
SFAS 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
We do not currently anticipate a material impact from the adoption of SFAS
154 on our financial statements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In accordance with SOP 90-7,
we are required to adopt all new accounting pronouncements upon emergence
from bankruptcy, if they have effective dates within one year of the date
of adoption of fresh start accounting. The Company adopted fresh start
accounting on February 1, 2006.
</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </font></font><b><i>(o)
Tax Contingencies</i></b> - We have recorded reserves for taxes and associated
interest in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "<i>Accounting for Contingencies",</i>
that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities.
Although we believe that the positions taken by the Company on previously
filed tax returns are reasonable, we nevertheless have established tax
and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may
challenge certain of the positions taken by the Company, potentially resulting
in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. Our tax contingency reserves
are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect
our estimated liability for additional taxes, such as the lapsing of applicable
statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits, the measurement
of additional estimated liability based on current calculations, the identification
of new tax contingencies, the release of administrative tax guidance affecting
our estimates of tax liabilities, or the rendering of court decisions affecting
our estimates of tax liabilities.
</p><p><b><u>(3) Special Items</u></b>
</p><p><i><b>2005 </b>-</i>
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Aircraft Impairment.
</i></b>During
the second quarter of 2005, we recognized a charge of $18 million for aircraft
impairments related to the planned accelerated retirement of certain aircraft
then operated by Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation ("AWAC").
</p><p><i><b>2004 </b>-</i>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Air Canada. </i></b>During
the third quarter of 2004, Air Canada successfully emerged from bankruptcy
protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ("CCAA") of the
Canada Business Corporation Act. We had filed a pre-petition claim against
Air Canada based on our equity interest in three Airbus A330 aircraft leased
to Air Canada. As part of its plan of reorganization, Air Canada offered
its unsecured creditors the opportunity to participate in their initial
public offering. We subscribed to 986,986 shares in the reorganized company
in August 2004 and sold them in October 2004 for a nominal gain. Separately,
we sold our interest in our pre-petition claim to a third-party and recorded
a non-operating gain of $18 million during the third quarter of 2004.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Aircraft Write-down.
</i></b>During
the first quarter of 2004, we incurred a $13 million charge in non-operating
expense for the write-down of certain non-operating B767 aircraft.
</p><p><b>2003 -</b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Aircraft Impairment.</i></b>
As a result of our review of our operating fleet as part of our overall
restructuring, we decided to accelerate the retirement of our B767-200
aircraft from 2008 to 2005. Therefore, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "<i>Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets</i>", we reviewed the B767-200 fleet for
impairment and adjusted the carrying value of these aircraft to their fair
market values, as estimated using third-party appraisals. An impairment
charge of $26 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2003.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Aircraft Write-down.</i></b>
During the third quarter of 2003, we also incurred a $25 million charge
in non-operating expense for the write-down of certain non-operating B767
aircraft.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Curtailment Charge.</i></b>
Due to the ratification of new labor contracts for our major employee groups,
which resulted in lower wage and benefit levels and significant levels
of employee attrition (both voluntary and involuntary), we recorded a curtailment
charge of $152 million in the second quarter of 2003, which is included
in salaries and related costs.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Air Canada</i>.</b>
On April 1, 2003, Air Canada filed for protection under the CCAA of the
Canada Business Corporation Act. During 2003, we recorded a non-operating
special charge of $226 million in connection with Air Canada's CCAA filing.
The charge included $46 million for the impairment of our investment in
Air Canada preferred stock, $91 million to record a liability resulting
from our guarantee of Air Canada debt, and $89 million for the write-off
of our equity interest in three Airbus A330 aircraft leased to Air Canada.
We consider the liability for the guarantee to be a pre-petition obligation
and accordingly, have classified it in liabilities subject to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Government Compensation.</i></b>
On April 16, 2003, the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act
("Wartime Act") was signed into law. The legislation included approximately
$3 billion of direct compensation for U.S. airlines. Of the total, $2.4
billion was intended to compensate air carriers for lost revenues and costs
related to aviation security (including $100 million for reinforcing cockpit
doors). In addition, collection of passenger security fees and payment
of air carrier security fees were suspended from June 1 through September
30, 2003.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition, the Wartime
Act required that the total compensation of the two most highly-compensated
executives of certain airlines (including United) be limited, during the
period between April 1, 2003 and April 1, 2004, to the salary they were
paid in 2002. We executed a contract with the government agreeing to comply
with these limits. Any violation of this provision would have required
us to repay the government the amount of compensation we received for airline
security fees described above. We believe that we complied with this provision
and that the likelihood of repaying the government is remote. In May 2003,
we received approximately $300 million in compensation under the Wartime
Act. In September 2003, we received an additional $14 million for cockpit
door reinforcement, which was accounted for as recovery of the capitalized
cost of door reinforcements previously completed.
</p><p><b><u>(4) Per Share Amounts</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Basic loss per share amounts
were computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the year. All shares of common stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date
were canceled pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Reorganization.

approximately 9 million shares of common stock at December 31, 2005, 10
million shares of common stock at December 31, 2004 and 11 million shares
of common stock at December 31, 2003 were outstanding but were not included
in the computation of earnings per share because the exercise price of
the options in all periods was greater than the average market price of
the common shares. In addition, approximately 6 million equivalent common
shares of convertible ESOP preferred stock were not included in the 2003

</p><p><b><u>(5) Comprehensive Loss</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company includes in other
comprehensive loss changes in minimum pension liabilities and changes in
the fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge
accounting. For the period ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, total
comprehensive loss amounted to $17.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $3.4 billion,
respectively. Total comprehensive loss for 2005 included a $3.3 billion
net adjustment relating to the termination of various pension plans, as
discussed in Note 15 "Retirement and Postretirement Plans".
</p><p><b><u>(6) Income Taxes</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 2005, UAL incurred both
a regular and an alternative minimum tax ("AMT") loss. The primary differences
between our regular tax loss and AMT loss are certain depreciation adjustments
and preferences.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In assessing the realizability
of our deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely
than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded a valuation allowance against our
deferred tax assets.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, UAL
and its subsidiaries had $294 million of federal AMT credits, $2.5 billion
of federal tax benefits and $0.2 billion of state tax benefits, resulting
from $7.0 billion of net operating losses which may be carried forward
to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. If not utilized, the federal
tax benefits of $0.2 billion expire in 2022, $1.2 billion expire in 2023,
$0.4 billion expire in 2024, $0.5 billion expire in 2025 and $0.2 billion
expire in 2026. In addition, the state tax benefit, if not utilized, expires
over a five to twenty year period.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We have determined that it
is more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset at December 31,
2005, will be realized through the reversals of existing deferred tax credits.
</p><p><b><u>(7) Investments</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On November 5, 2003, IAC/InterActive
Corp acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Hotwire, a leading
discount travel website, for cash and the assumption of outstanding options
and warrants. We owned approximately 14% of Hotwire, through a combination
of stocks and warrants. As a result, we tendered all of our shares in Hotwire,
including options and warrants, for $85 million in cash, resulting in a
gain of $81 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In December 2003, Orbitz
completed an initial public offering of its stock, which resulted in a
reduction of our ownership percentage. As a result, we recognized a gain
of $23 million in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51 "<i>Accounting
for Sales of Stock by a Subsidiary</i>". In addition, we sold a portion
of our investment in Orbitz for cash proceeds of $65 million and recognized
a gain of $54 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On September 29, 2004, Cendant
and Orbitz announced their planned merger. Cendant offered to acquire all
of the outstanding common stock of Orbitz for cash. We entered into a stockholder
agreement to tender our shares. Subsequent to Bankruptcy Court approval,
we tendered all of our shares in Orbitz for $185 million in cash, resulting
in a gain of $158 million.
</p><p><b><u>(8) Liabilities Subject to Compromise</u></b>
</p><p><font size="+0">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </font>Liabilities
subject to compromise refers to both secured and unsecured obligations
which will be accounted for under our confirmed Plan of Reorganization,
including claims incurred prior to the Petition Date. They represent the
estimated amount expected to be allowed on known or potential claims to
be resolved through the Chapter 11 process, and remain subject to future
adjustments arising from negotiated settlements, actions of the Bankruptcy
Court, rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases, the determination
as to the value of any collateral securing claims, proofs of claim or other
events. To date, such adjustments, as reflected in reorganization expense,
have been material and we anticipate that future adjustments will be material
as well.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Differences between liability
amounts we have estimated and claims filed by our creditors are being investigated
and the Bankruptcy Court will make a final determination of the allowable
claims. The determination of how these liabilities will ultimately be treated
will not be known until the claims resolution process is complete.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, we
had liabilities subject to compromise consisting of the following:

<p><b><u>(9) Long-Term Debt</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December 31, 2005,
long-term debt consisted of the DIP Financing and debt associated with
certain aircraft operated by Air Canada ("Air Canada debt"). For details
on the DIP Financing, see Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter
11 - DIP Financing". As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding debt of
$154 million associated with an operating lease for aircraft operated by
Air Canada. The debt has a fixed interest rate of 7.15% and is scheduled
to mature at various times through January 2016.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All of our pre-petition debt
is in default due to the Chapter 11 filing. In general, we were not permitted
to make payments on pre-petition debt while in Chapter 11; however, to
the extent we had reached agreements with certain financiers on specific
aircraft governed by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, we continued
to make payments on the secured notes financing the aircraft with the approval
of the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, we had rejected certain aircraft
that were originally financed under secured notes and had reclassified
to liabilities subject to compromise $651 million in principal amount of
these notes.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, we
had recorded $434 million in municipal bonds to finance the acquisition
and construction of certain facilities at Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami
and Chicago. These municipal bonds were rejected and/or settled as part
of the bankruptcy process and currently are recorded in liabilities subject
to compromise. For further details, see Note 1 "Voluntary Reorganization
Under Chapter 11 - Bankruptcy Considerations".
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We have a subsidiary trust
that has TOPrS outstanding with a liquidation value of $97 million. These
securities were issued in December 1996 and were previously reported on
our <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial Position</u> as Company-Obligated
Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary Trust. The
trust is considered a variable interest entity under FASB Interpretation
No. 46R, "<i>Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - Revised</i>"
("FIN 46R") because we have a limited ability to make decisions about its
activities. However, we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the
trust. Therefore, the trust and the Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities
issued by the trust are no longer reported on our <u>Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position</u>. Instead, we report our Junior Subordinated Debentures
held by the trust as long-term debt included in liabilities subject to
compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our pre-petition debt, which
is included in liabilities subject to compromise, consisted of the following:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December
31, 2005, as a result of reaching agreements for specific aircraft under
Section 1110, which have been confirmed in our Plan of Reorganization,
we currently anticipate making the following principal payments under long-term
debt agreements (including Air Canada debt and DIP Financing) in each of
the next five calendar years: 2006 - $1.5 billion; 2007 - $453 million;
2008 - $592 million; 2009 - $649 million and 2010 - $828 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Various assets, principally
aircraft, having an aggregate book value of $9 billion at December 31,
2005, were pledged as security under various loan agreements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The carrying amount
of our borrowings under the DIP Financing approximates fair value. The
fair value of our debt included in liabilities subject to compromise is
estimated at approximately $7.0 billion at December 31, 2005.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On the Effective Date, United
entered into the Credit Facility provided by a syndicate of banks and other
financial institutions led by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citicorp
Global Markets Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint book runners; JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMCB") and Citicorp USA, Inc. ("CITI"), as co-administrative
agents and co-collateral agents; General Electric Capital Corporation,
as syndication agent; and JPMCB as paying agent. The Credit Facility provides
for a total commitment of up to $3.0 billion, comprised of two separate
tranches: (i) Tranche A consisting of up to $200 million revolving commitment
available for Tranche A loans and for standby letters of credit to be issued
in the ordinary course of business of United or one of its subsidiary guarantors,
and (ii) Tranche B consisting of a term loan commitment of up to $2.45
billion available at the time of closing and additional term loan commitments
of up to $350 million available upon, among other things, United's acquiring
unencumbered title to some or all of the 14 airframes and related engines
that were subject to United's 1997-1 EETC financing. The Credit Facility
matures on February 1, 2012.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Borrowings under the Credit
Facility bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either a base rate,
or at our option, a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin of 2.75% in the
case of the base rate loans and 3.75% in the case of the LIBOR loans. The
Tranche B term loan requires regularly scheduled semi-annual payments of
principal equal to 0.5% of the original principal amount of the Tranche
B term loan. Interest is payable on the last day of the applicable interest
period but in no event less than quarterly. The Company has since entered
into an interest rate swap whereby it fixed the rate of interest of 5.14%
plus a fixed credit margin. For further details, see Note 17, "Financial
Instruments and Risk Management". At any time prior to February 1, 2007,
United may use the proceeds from any lower-cost refinancing to redeem some
or all of the term loans at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The obligations under the
Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain
of the direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company (other
than United) (the "Guarantors"), and are secured by a security interest
in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Guarantors.
The obligations under the Credit Facility are also secured by a pledge
of the capital stock of United and the direct and indirect subsidiaries
of the Company and United, except that a pledge of any first-tier foreign
subsidiary is limited to 65% of the stock of such subsidiary and such foreign
subsidiaries are not required to pledge the stock of their subsidiaries.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Credit Facility contains
covenants that will limit the ability of United and the Guarantors to,
among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, create
liens, pay dividends on or repurchase stock, make certain types of investments,
pay dividends or other payments from United's direct or indirect subsidiaries,
enter into transactions with affiliates, sell assets or merge with other
companies, modify corporate documents or change lines of business. The
Credit Facility also requires compliance with several financial covenants,
including (i) a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of cash, interest expense,
aircraft rent and scheduled debt payments, (ii) a minimum unrestricted
cash balance of $1.2 billion, to be reduced to $1.0 billion after December
31, 2006 assuming United is in compliance with the ratio calculated under
(i) above, and (iii) the market value of the collateral must be greater
than 150% of the sum of (a) the aggregate outstanding amount of the loans
plus (b) the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus (c)
the unreimbursed amount of drawings under any letters of credit, and (d)
the termination value of certain interest rate protection and hedging agreements
with the exit lenders and their affiliates. The Credit Facility received
a rating of B+ from Standard &amp; Poor's and B1 from Moody's Investment
Services.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United used $2.65 billion
of the borrowings under the Credit Facility at the Effective Date to finance
working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including
repayment of the borrowings outstanding under the DIP Financing. Subsequently,
the Company repaid $161 million on the revolving credit line and accessed
the remaining $350 million on the term loan. We expect to be in compliance
with these covenants, but there are no assurances we will be able to do
so. Failure to comply with our Credit Facility covenants could result in
a default under the Credit Facility unless we obtain a waiver of, or otherwise
mitigate, the default. Additionally, the Credit Facility contains a cross-default
provision with respect to defaults on our other credit arrangements that
exceed $40 million. A default could result in a termination of the Credit
Facility and a requirement to accelerate repayment of all outstanding borrowings.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result of the replacement
of the DIP Financing with the Credit Facility, as of February 1, 2006,
we anticipate making the following principal payments under long-term debt
agreements in each of the next five calendar years: 2006 - $376 million;
2007 - $481 million; 2008 - $620 million; 2009 - $677 million and 2010
- $856 million.
</p><p><b><u>(10) Lease Obligations</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL leases aircraft, airport
passenger terminal space, aircraft hangars and related maintenance facilities,
cargo terminals, other airport facilities, other commercial real estate,
office and computer equipment and vehicles. As allowed under Section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code, we may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain
executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property,
aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and certain other conditions.
<br/>&#160;
<br/>&#160;
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, scheduled
future minimum lease payments under capital leases (substantially all of
which are for aircraft) and operating leases having initial or remaining
noncancelable lease terms of more than one year were as follows:

</table>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December 31, 2005,
we leased 230 mainline aircraft, 57 of which were under capital leases.
These leases have initial terms of 10 to 26 years, and expiration dates
ranging from 2006 through 2024. Under the terms of all leases, we have
the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some
cases at fair market value and in others at fair market value or a percentage
of cost. Additionally, the above amounts include lease payments related
to our United Express contracts for 37 aircraft under capital leases and
237 aircraft under operating leases as described in Note 2(i), "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies - United Express."
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Certain of our aircraft lease
transactions contain provisions such as put options giving the lessor the
right to require us to purchase the aircraft at lease termination for a
certain amount resulting in residual value guarantees. Leases containing
this or similar provisions are recorded as capital leases on the balance
sheet and, accordingly, any and all residual value guarantee amounts contained
in an aircraft lease are fully reflected as capital lease obligations on
the <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial Position</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In connection with the financing
of certain euro-denominated aircraft financings accounted for as capital
leases, United had on deposit in certain banks at December 31, 2005 an
aggregate 391 million euros ($461 million) and $16 million, and had pledged
an irrevocable security interest in such deposits to certain of the aircraft
lessors. These deposits will be used to repay an equivalent amount of recorded
capital lease obligations, and are classified as aircraft lease deposits
in the accompanying <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial Position</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Amounts charged to rent expense,
net of minor amounts of sublease rentals, were $1.0 billion in 2005, $1.1
billion in 2004 and $1.2 billion in 2003.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the first quarter of 2004,
we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "<i>Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities</i>" ("FIN 46") and FIN 46R which requires disclosure of certain
information about VIEs that are consolidated and certain other information
about VIEs that are not consolidated.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We have various financing
arrangements for aircraft in which the lessors are trusts established specifically
to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to us. These leasing entities meet
the criteria for variable interest entities; however, we are not considered
the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities since the lease terms are
consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include
a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature
that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate
in increases in the value of the aircraft. These financing arrangements
include 76 aircraft operating leases that contain a fair market value purchase
option. These leases became effective upon the confirmation of the Plan
of Reorganization.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company has 97 additionaloperating
leases, for which all but 26 have a fixed price or fair market value purchase
option. United does not guarantee the residual value of these aircraft.
</p><p><b><u>(11) Serial Preferred Stock</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, we
had outstanding 3,203,177 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of
one share of Series B 12 &#188;% preferred stock, with a liquidation
preference of $25 per depositary share ($25,000 per Series B preferred
share) and a stated capital of $0.01 per Series B preferred share. We had
the option to redeem any portion of the Series B preferred stock or the
depositary shares for cash after July 11, 2004, at the equivalent of $25
per depositary share, plus accrued dividends. The Series B preferred stock
was not convertible into any other securities, had no stated maturity and
was not subject to mandatory redemption. In accordance with the Company's
confirmed Plan of Reorganization, the Series B preferred stock was canceled.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Prior to its cancellation,
the Series B preferred stock ranked senior to all other preferred and common
stock outstanding, except the TOPrS, as to receipt of dividends and amounts
distributed upon liquidation. The Series B preferred stock had voting rights
only to the extent required by law and with respect to charter amendments
that adversely affected the preferred stock or the creation or issuance
of any security ranking senior to the preferred stock. Additionally, if
dividends were not paid for six cumulative quarters, the Series B preferred
stockholders were entitled to elect two additional members to the UAL Board
of Directors until all dividends were paid in full. In accordance with
our restated certificate of incorporation, we were authorized to issue
a total of 50,000 shares of Series B preferred stock.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On September 30, 2002, we
announced the suspension of the payment of dividends on the Series B preferred
stock. As a result of our Chapter 11 filing, we stopped accruing for unpaid
dividends on the Series B preferred stock. The amount of dividends in arrears
was approximately $32 million as of December 31, 2005.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2005, UAL
was authorized to issue up to 15,986,584 additional shares of serial preferred
stock.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On June 26, 2003, the ESOP
was terminated following the publication of a regulation by the Internal
Revenue Service that would permit the distribution of the remaining ESOP
shares to plan participants without jeopardizing our ability to utilize
our net operating losses. As a result of the termination of the ESOP, employees
were given until August 18, 2003 to make elections for distribution of
their stock in the plan. For participants who did not make an election
regarding their stock prior to the August 18 deadline, the stock remained
in the plan and distributions continued on a monthly basis until June of
2004, when we implemented a forced distribution of the remaining shares
in the plan. On June 28, 2004, all remaining ESOP shares were converted
to common and either distributed to participants at their request or transferred
to a broker account in their name.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Each share of Class 1 and
Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock was convertible into four shares of UAL common
stock. Shares typically were converted to common as employees retired or
otherwise left the Company. The ESOP Preferred Stock was nonvoting, with
a par value of $0.01 per share and a liquidation value of $126.96 per share.
The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock provided a fixed annual dividend of $8.8872
per share, which ceased on March 31, 2000; the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock
did not pay a fixed dividend.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Voting ESOP Preferred
Stock had a par value and liquidation preference of $0.01 per share. The
stock was not entitled to receive any dividends and was convertible into
.0004 shares of UAL common stock.

</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December 31, 2005,
the Company had granted options to purchase common stock to various officers
and employees. The option price for all stock options was at least 100%
of the fair market value of UAL common stock at the date of grant. The
options generally vested and became exercisable in four equal, annual installments
beginning one year after the date of grant, and generally expired in ten
years. We did not issue any stock options during 2005, 2004 or 2003. Under
the Company's confirmed Plan of Reorganization, these stock options were
canceled upon the Effective Date.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December 31, 2005,
we had also awarded shares of restricted stock to certain officers and
key employees. These shares generally vested over a five-year period and
were subject to certain transfer restrictions and forfeiture under certain
circumstances prior to vesting. Unearned compensation, representing the
fair market value of the stock at the measurement date for the award, was
amortized to salaries and related costs over the vesting period. No shares
were issued in 2005, 2004 or 2003. As of December 31, 2005, all restricted
shares were fully vested. Under the Company's confirmed Plan of Reorganization,
the existing restricted stock was canceled upon the Effective Date.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; SFAS No. 123 establishes
a fair value based method of accounting for stock options. As discussed
in Note 2(m), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Stock Option
Accounting," we have elected to continue using the intrinsic value method
of accounting prescribed in APB 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, and as
amended by SFAS No. 148, "<i>Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition
and Disclosure</i>."

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In accordance with
the Plan of Reorganization, in 2006 the Company approved the distribution
of the following stock awards with vesting periods of four years:
</p><ul>
<li>
Up to 9.825 million shares of common stock and options (or rights to acquire
shares) under the MEIP approved by the Bankruptcy Court, and</li>
<li>
Up to 175,000 shares of common stock and options (or rights to acquire
shares) under the DEIP approved by the Bankruptcy Court.</li>
</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In accordance with SFAS 123R,
the Company has estimated its compensation expense on the MEIP and DEIP
programs.&#160; For further details, see Note 2(n), "New Accounting Pronouncements".
<p><b><u>(15) Retirement and Postretirement Plans</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Historically, the Company
has maintained various retirement plans, both defined benefit (qualified
and non-qualified) and defined contribution, which have covered substantially
all employees. We also have provided certain health care benefits, primarily
in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain life
insurance benefits to certain retirees. The Company has reserved the right,
subject to collective bargaining agreements, to modify or terminate the
health care and life insurance benefits for both current and future retirees.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In connection with the Company's
restructuring in bankruptcy, the defined benefit plans for our U.S. employees
were terminated and replaced with certain defined contribution plans, subject
to the outcome of the matters being considered by the District Court as
is more fully described in Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter
11- Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in Bankruptcy Court".
The Company has maintained unchanged other defined benefit and defined
contribution plans for certain of its non-U.S. employees. During bankruptcy,
we also restructured certain postretirement benefit obligations under Section
1114 of the Bankruptcy Code. For further information, see Note 1, "Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter".
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On December 30, 2004, the
PBGC filed a complaint against the Company in the District Court to seek
the involuntary termination of the Pilot Plan, with benefit accruals terminated
effective December 30, 2004.&#160; The Company recorded a $152 million
curtailment charge in the fourth quarter of 2004 relating to the PBGC's
involuntary termination action and reclassified the associated pension
obligations of $2.5 billion to liabilities subject to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In April 2005, United and
the PBGC entered into a global settlement agreement which provided for
the settlement and compromise of various disputes and controversies with
respect to the Pension Plans. In May 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved
the settlement agreement, including modifications requested by certain
creditors.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The PBGC assumed responsibility
for the assets for the Ground Plan effective May 23, 2005 (with a termination
date of March 11, 2005), the Flight Attendant and the MAPC Plans effective
June 30, 2005 and the Pilot Plan effective October 26, 2005, and the Company
has no further duties or rights with respect to these Pension Plans, subject
to the outcome of the matters being considered by the District Court as
is more fully described in Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter
11 - Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in Bankruptcy Court".
On March 17, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the Company's obligations
regarding non-qualified benefits that were earned under the Pilot Plan
ceased January 31, 2006 (representing approximately $72 million of payments
annually). In 2005, the Company recorded an additional $640 million in
curtailment charges related to these Pension Plans and reclassified an
additional $1.9 billion of pension obligations to liabilities subject to
compromise. The Company also recorded approximately $7.2 billion of PBGC
allowable claims in liabilities subject to compromise in accordance with
the confirmed Plan of Reorganization. In addition, the Company recognized
net settlement losses of approximately $1.1 billion in 2005 in accordance
with SFAS No. 88, "<i>Employer's Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits" </i>("SFAS
88").
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On May 19, 2004, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2 ("FSP 106-2") which superseded FASB
Staff Position No. 106-1 ("FSP 106-1") and provided specific guidance on
accounting for the federal subsidy provided to sponsors of certain retiree
health care benefit plans. The issuance of FSP 106-2 did not significantly
change our accounting for the federal subsidy, which reduced the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $280 million when we
adopted FSP 106-1 in late 2003. The expected federal subsidy decreased
our postretirement cost in 2005 and 2004 by approximately $47 million and
$37 million, respectively.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The following table sets
forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit
obligation and plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized
in the <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial Position</u> for the defined
benefit and other postretirement plans as of December 31 (utilizing a measurement
date of December 31):

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our targeted allocation of
assets was to the following investment types: 60% equities, 35% fixed income
and 5% other, with approximate expected long-term rates of return of 10%,
7.5% and 15%, respectively.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We believe that the long-term
asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and
regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance
the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate. Pension expense
is reduced by the expected return on plan assets, which is measured by
assuming the market-related value of plan assets increases at the expected
rate of return. The market-related value is a calculated value that phases
in differences between the expected rate of return and the actual return
over a period of five years.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; With the termination of our
qualified and non-qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans, we will
not make further cash contributions to these trusts.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In place of the domestic
defined benefit pension plans that the PBGC terminated in 2005, the Company
enhanced its defined contribution plans for most employee groups by adding
a matching percentage or increasing the direct employer contribution percentages
based on eligible earnings. For certain employees, the Company agreed to
contribute to a multi-employer benefit plan based on hours worked beginning
in March 2006. The Company agreed to accrue contributions to most of its
defined contribution plans beginning in June and July 2005, although such
matching contributions for 2005 were not funded until shortly after the
Effective Date. The Company's contribution percentages, which continue
after 2005, vary from 2.7% to 15% of eligible earnings depending on the
terms of each plan. In 2005, the Company recognized $122 million in defined
contribution expense. The Company intends to contribute approximately $296
million (which includes $54 million of 2005 accrued defined contributions
and $24 million for pilots non-qualified contributions through January
31, 2006) and $183 million, respectively, to our defined contribution plans
and other benefit plans in 2006. In addition, the following benefit payments
are expected to be paid in future years:

<p><b><u>(16) Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>General Guarantees
and Indemnifications. </i></b>In the normal course of business, we enter
into numerous real estate leasing and aircraft financing arrangements that
have various guarantees included in the contracts. These guarantees are
primarily in the form of indemnities. In both leasing and financing transactions,
we typically indemnify the lessors, and any tax/financing parties, against
tort liabilities that arise out of the use, occupancy, operation or maintenance
of the leased premises or financed aircraft. Currently, we believe that
any future payments required under these guarantees or indemnities would
be immaterial, as most tort liabilities and related indemnities are covered
by insurance (subject to deductibles). Additionally, certain leased premises
such as fueling stations or storage facilities include indemnities of such
parties for any environmental liability that may arise out of or relate
to the use of the leased premises.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Financings and Guarantees.&#160;</i></b>
In addition to common commercial lease transactions, we had entered into
numerous long-term agreements to lease certain airport and maintenance
facilities that are financed through tax-exempt municipal bonds in the
amount of $1.7 billion in principal. These municipal bonds were issued
by various local municipalities to build or improve airport and maintenance
facilities. Under these lease agreements, we were required to make rental
payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest
payments on the bonds. However, as a result of our bankruptcy filing, we
were not permitted to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt. We
were advised that our municipal bonds may be unsecured (or in certain instances,
partially secured) pre-petition debt. As of December 31, 2005, the Company
had settled approximately $1.2 billion in principal of such bonds through
the bankruptcy process. At December 31, 2005, $510 million in principal
of such bonds was outstanding but not recorded in the <u>Statements of
Consolidated Financial Position</u> in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP"). UAL guaranteed $60 million and United guaranteed
$510 million of such bonds, including accrued interest. For further details,
see Note 1 "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 - Bankruptcy Considerations".
</p><p><font size="+0"><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fuel
Consortia. </i></b>We participate in numerous fuel consortia with other
carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and
storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of
the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs
to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortium (and in limited
cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements
to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that
are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities
lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various
local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement requires
the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the
maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December 31,
2005, approximately $449 million principal amount of such bonds were secured
by fuel facility leases at major hubs in which we participate. United's
maximum exposure is approximately $143 million principal amount of such
bonds based on our past consortia participation and will only trigger if
the other participating carriers or consortia members default on their
lease payments. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are
paid in full, which ranges from 2010 to 2028. We did not record a liability
at the time these indirect guarantees were made.</font>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>EETC Debt.</i></b>
In 1997 and 2000, we issued Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates ("EETCs")
to refinance certain owned aircraft and aircraft under operating leases.
A portion of these proceeds are direct obligations of United and were recognized
in the <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial Position</u> while certain
other proceeds were placed in trusts not owned by or affiliated with United.
The proceeds placed in off-balance sheet trusts were used to refinance
the remaining bank debt of the lessors in existing leveraged leases with
United. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $279 million of these proceeds
were placed in off-balance sheet trusts.&#160; During March 2006, the Company
purchased the 1997-1 EETC Tranche A certificates which satisfied $23 million
of the off-balance sheet debt. For further details on the 1997-1 EETC transaction,
see Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 - Bankruptcy Considerations".
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Legal and Environmental
Contingencies. </i></b>UAL has certain contingencies resulting from litigation
and claims (including environmental issues) incident to the ordinary course
of business. Management believes, after considering a number of factors,
including (but not limited to) the views of legal counsel, the nature of
contingencies to which we are subject and prior experience, that the ultimate
disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We record liabilities for
legal and environmental claims against us in accordance with GAAP. These
amounts are recorded based on our assessments of the likelihood of their
eventual disposition. The amounts of these liabilities could increase or
decrease in the near term, based on revisions to estimates relating to
the various claims. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, as of the Petition
Date virtually all pending litigation is stayed, and absent further order
of the Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject to certain exceptions, may take
any action, again subject to certain exceptions, to recover on pre-petition
claims against us. Accordingly, we have classified certain of these liabilities
as liabilities subject to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company anticipates that
if ultimately found liable, its damages from claims arising from the events
of September 11, 2001 could be significant; however, we believe that, under
the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001, our
liability will be limited to our insurance coverage.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We have not incurred any
material environmental obligations relating to the events of September
11, 2001.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Commitments. </i></b>At
December 31, 2005, future commitments for the purchase of property and
equipment, principally aircraft, approximated $1.8 billion, after deducting
advance payments.&#160; Our current commitments are primarily for the purchase
of A319 and A320 aircraft.&#160; In January 2006, we reached an agreement
with the airframe manufacturer to delay, with the right to cancel these
future orders.&#160; We also reached an agreement with the engine manufacturer
eliminating all provisions pertaining to firm commitments and support for
future Airbus aircraft. While this permits future negotiations on engine
pricing with any engine manufacturer, restructured aircraft manufacturer
commitments have assumed that aircraft will be delivered with installed
engines at list price. As a result of these subsequent changes, estimated
future commitments have increased to $2.5 billion in early 2006, after
deducting advanced payments.&#160; An estimated $0.1 billion will be spent
in 2006, $0.1 billion for years 2007 and 2008, $0.1 billion for years 2009
and 2010 and $2.2 billion thereafter.&#160; The disposition of $91 million
of advance payments made by the Company is subject to United taking future
delivery of these aircraft.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Collective Bargaining
Agreements. </i></b>Approximately 80% of United's employees are represented
by various U.S. labor organizations. In April 2003, we reached agreements
with all of our labor unions for new collective bargaining agreements which
became effective on May 1, 2003. During 2005, we reached new agreements
with our labor unions for new collective bargaining agreements which became
effective in January, 2005. These latter agreements are not amendable until
January 2010. In addition, an initial collective bargaining agreement with
the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers was
ratified on March 8, 2006, with an initial effective date of March 1, 2006;
this agreement is likewise not amendable until January 2010.
</p><p><b><u>(17) Financial Instruments and Risk Management</u></b>
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Aircraft Fuel</i> - Aircraft
fuel represented 23%, 17% and 13% of our total operating expenses for 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, aircraft fuel was the largest operating
expense.
</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="+0">&#160;</font></font>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the second quarter of 2004, we began to implement a strategy to
hedge a portion of our price risk related to projected jet fuel requirements
primarily through collar options. The collars (only some of which were
designated as cash flow hedges) involve the purchase of fuel call options
with the simultaneous sale of fuel put options with identical expiration
dates. Those contracts designated as hedges are recorded at fair value,
with the changes in intrinsic value, to the extent they are effective,
recorded
in other comprehensive loss until the underlying hedged fuel is consumed.
To the extent that the designated hedges are ineffective, gain or loss
is recognized currently. The fair value of each designated hedge is determined
by the use of standard option value models using commodity-related assumptions
derived from prices observed in underlying markets. For those contracts
not designated as hedges, the related gain or loss is recognized currently
as an element of non-operating income. In 2005, the Company recognized
income of $40 million (which included a loss of approximately $1 million
as a result of ineffective fuel hedges) in non-operating income mainly
due to non-designated hedges. At December 31, 2005, we had no fuel hedges.
In February 2006, the Company entered into fuel hedges that account for
approximately 8% of projected 2006 mainline and United Express fuel requirements.
We plan to continue to hedge future fuel purchases for 2006 and beyond
as circumstances and market conditions allow.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Interest Rate -</i> In
the first quarter of 2006, United entered into an interest rate swap whereby
it fixed the rate of interest on $2.45 billion notional value of floating-rate
debt at 5.14% plus a fixed credit margin. The swap will amortize according
to a pre-established schedule starting in November 2007 through its expected
maturity date of February 2012.
</p><p><b><u>(18) Segment Information</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL operates its businesses
through five reporting segments:&#160; North America, Pacific, Atlantic,
Latin America (all of which are operated by United) and UAL Loyalty Services,
LLC ("ULS").
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In accordance with DOT guidelines,
we allocate mainline and regional affiliate passenger and cargo revenues
to the North America segment based on the actual flown revenue for flights
with an origin and destination wholly within the U.S. Passenger and cargo
revenue is allocated to international segments based on the actual flown
revenue for flights with an international origin or destination in that
segment. Other revenues that are not directly associated with a specific
flight (such as Red Carpet Club membership fees) are allocated based on
the pro rata share of available seat miles flown in each segment.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The accounting policies for
each of these segments are the same as those described in Note 2, "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies," except that segment financial information
has been prepared using a management approach which is consistent with
how we internally disperse financial information for the purpose of making
internal operating decisions. We evaluate segment financial performance
based on earnings before income taxes, special items, reorganization items,
government compensation and gain on sale of investments.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL's operations involve
an insignificant level of dedicated revenue-producing assets by reportable
segment. ULS has $1.6 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2005.
The overwhelming majority of United's revenue producing assets (which are
primarily U.S. registered aircraft) can be deployed in any of United's
reportable operating segments, as any given aircraft may be used in multiple
segments on any given day. Therefore, we allocate depreciation and amortization
expense associated with those assets on the basis of available seat miles
flown in each segment. In addition, we have significant intangible assets
related to the acquisition of our Atlantic and Latin America route authorities.

<p><b><u>(20) Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance Sheet (Unaudited)</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In connection with emergence
from Chapter 11 protection, the Company adopted fresh start accounting
as of February 1, 2006 in accordance with SOP 90-7. Upon the adoption of
fresh start accounting the financial statements of the Company will not
be comparable, in various material respects, to any of the Company's previously
issued financial statements. The financial statements as of February 1,
2006, and for periods subsequent to the fresh start effective date, reflect
that of a new entity. Fresh start accounting results in the creation of
a new reporting entity having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fresh start accounting reflects
the value of the Company as determined in the confirmed Plan of Reorganization.
Under fresh start accounting, the Company's asset values are remeasured
using fair value, and are allocated in conformity with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, "<i>Business Combinations</i>". Fresh start
accounting also requires that all liabilities, other than deferred taxes,
should be stated at fair value or at the present values of the amounts
to be paid using appropriate market interest rates. Deferred taxes are
determined in conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109 "<i>Accounting for Income Taxes</i>".
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The following Pro Forma
Fresh Start Balance Sheet illustrates the presently- estimated financial
effects of the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization and the adoption
of fresh start accounting. This Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance Sheet reflects
the assumed effect of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
in the Plan of Reorganization, including settlement of various liabilities
and securities issuances, incurrence of new indebtedness, and cash payments.
This Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance Sheet is presented as if the effectiveness
of the Plan of Reorganization had occurred, and the Company had adopted
fresh start accounting, as of December 31, 2005.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This pro forma data is unaudited.
Asset appraisals for fresh start accounting have not yet been entirely
completed, and comparable interest rate and other data required for evaluation
of liability values are still being compiled and finalized. Changes in
the values of assets and liabilities and changes in assumptions from those
reflected in the Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance Sheet could significantly
impact the reported value of goodwill. Accordingly, the amounts shown are
not final, and are subject to changes and revisions, including differences
between the estimates used to develop this Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance
Sheet and the actual amounts ultimately determined. Balances also will
differ due to the results of operations and other transactions occurring
between December 31, 2005 and February 1, 2006, which is the adoption date
of fresh start accounting.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The pro forma effects of
the Plan of Reorganization and fresh start accounting on the Company's
Pro Forma Fresh Start Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 are as follows

<i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </i>(b)<i>&#160; Debt Discharge
&amp; Reclassifications</i>.
<blockquote>This column reflects the discharge, reinstatement or reclassification
of liabilities subject to compromise pursuant to the terms of the Plan
of Reorganization. Along with other creditor claims accumulated through
the bankruptcy proceedings (e.g. by the rejection of aircraft, etc.), discharged
liabilities include claims related to the Debtor's defined pension plans.</blockquote>
<p><br/>The Debtor's liabilities subject to compromise<i> </i>total approximately
$35 billion, of which:
</p><ul>
<li>
$7.0 billion is reclassified as current and long-term reinstated secured
aircraft debt.</li>
<li>
$1.1 billion represents the estimated fair value of newly-issued 5% convertible
notes, additional convertible notes issuable within the first six months
after the Effective Date and 6% senior unsecured notes.</li>
<li>
$0.3 billion represents the fair value of newly-issued convertible preferred
stock.</li>
<li>
$1.1 billion represents accruals for administrative and priority payments,
reinstatement of municipal bond obligations, and other accruals required
for the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization.</li>
</ul>
As a result of the various debt discharge &amp; reclassification<i> </i>transactions,
a gain on extinguishment of debt of $25.5 billion is expected to be recognized
as a non-cash reorganization income item.
<p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </i>(c)<i>&#160; New Credit Facility
Financing Transactions</i>.
</p><ol type="a">This column reflects $1.4 billion in net proceeds from the
Credit Facility consisting of borrowings of $2.6 billion under the Credit
Facility, and the simultaneous repayment of the Company's $1.2 billion
DIP Financing.</ol>
<i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </i>(d)&#160; <i>Fresh-Start Adjustments.</i>
<p>Fresh start adjustments are made to reflect asset values at their estimated
fair value and liabilities at estimated fair value or the present value
of amounts to be paid, including:
</p><ul>
<li>
$1.6 billion to reduce the values of operating property and equipment to
their estimated fair market value,</li>
<li>
Recognition of additional estimated fair value of $2.8 billion for international
route authorities, slots and other identified intangible assets,</li>
<li>
The elimination of the predecessor entity's equity accounts,</li>
<li>
Reclassification of certain flight equipment between those subject to mortgage
financing, capital lease financing and operating lease financing,</li>
<li>
Net changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities,</li>
<li>
Additionally, goodwill of $0.5 billion is recorded to reflect the excess
of the estimated fair value of identifiable assets over liabilities and
equity.</li>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The sum of quarterly loss
per share amounts for 2004 is not the same as the annual loss per share
amount because of changing numbers of shares outstanding.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The quarterly results were
impacted by the following significant items:
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the first quarter
of 2005, we recorded $768 million in reorganization items.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the second quarter
of 2005, we recorded $18 million in impairment charges for the write down
of aircraft operated by AWAC. Additionally, we recorded $1.4 billion in
reorganization items.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the third quarter
of 2005, we recorded $1.8 billion in reorganization items.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the fourth quarter
of 2005, we recorded $16.6 billion in reorganization items.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the first quarter
of 2004, we adjusted our mainline passenger revenue and recognized an additional
$60 million in passenger revenue. In addition, we incurred a $13 million
charge in non-operating expense for the write-down of certain non-operating
B767 aircraft and recorded $130 million in reorganization items.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the second quarter
of 2004, we recorded $144 million in reorganization items.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the third quarter
of 2004, Air Canada successfully emerged from protection under the CCAA.
We had filed a pre-petition claim against Air Canada based on our equity
interest in three Airbus A330 aircraft leased to Air Canada. As part of
its plan of reorganization, Air Canada offered its unsecured creditors
the opportunity to participate in their initial public offering. We subscribed
to 986,986 shares in the reorganized company in August 2004 and sold them
in October 2004 for a nominal gain. Separately, we sold our pre-petition
claim and recorded a non-operating gain of $18 million during the third
quarter of 2004. Additionally, we recorded $115 million in reorganization
items.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the fourth quarter
of 2004, we sold our investment in Orbitz and recognized a gain of $158
million in non-operating expense and recorded $222 million in reorganization
items.

<b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>The management
of UAL Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company's
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
that:
<ul>
<li>
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions of the Company;</li>
<li>
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and</li>
<li>
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.</li>
</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company's management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, the Company's
management used the criteria as set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Based on their assessment,
management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company's independent
auditors have issued an audit report on management's assessment of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. This report appears
in this Item 9A.
<br/>&#160;
<br/>&#160;
</p><p>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
</p><p>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
<br/>UAL Corporation
<br/>Elk Grove Township, Illinois
</p><p>We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that UAL
Corporation (Debtor-in-Possession) and subsidiaries (the "Company") maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.
</p><p>We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&#160; Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.
</p><p>A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
</p><p>Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</p><p>In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
</p><p>We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005 of the Company and our report dated March 30, 2006 expressed
an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
schedule and included an explanatory paragraph related to the confirmation

</p><p><b><u>Board Independence</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>The Board of Directors
made a determination that all of the members of the Board are "independent"
other than Messrs. Bathurst, Canale and Tilton under the corporate governance
rules of the NASDAQ National Market with the assistance of the categorical
standards adopted by the Board in the UAL Corporation Corporate Governance
Guidelines (see below). Messrs. Bathurst, Canale and Tilton are not independent
because each is an employee of United Air Lines, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary
of UAL Corporation.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Board has established
these categorical standards to assist it in determining whether a director
has any direct or indirect material relationship with the Company.&#160;
A director is independent if, within the three years preceding the determination:
</p><ul>
<li>
the director was not an employee of the Company and none of the director's
immediate family members was an executive officer of the Company;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
the director, and each immediate family member of the director, did not

fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service
(provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service);</li>
</ul>
<ul>

not a partner of a firm that is the internal or external auditor of the
Company, (2) the director was not a current employee of the firm, (3) the
director did not have an immediate family member who was a current employee
of the firm and who participated in the firm's audit, assurance or tax
compliance (but not tax planning) practice, or (4) the director, and each
immediate family member, was not within the last three years a partner
or employee of the firm and personally worked on the Company's audit within
that time;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
the director, and each immediate family member of the director, was not
employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the Company's
executive officers at the same time serves or served on the other company's
compensation committee;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
the director was not an affiliate, executive officer or employee of, and
each immediate family member of the director was not an affiliate or executive
officer of, another company that makes payments to, or receives payments
from, the Company for property or services in an amount that, in any of
the last three fiscal years accounted for at least two percent (2%) or
$1 million, whichever is greater, of such other company's consolidated
gross revenues;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
the director, and each immediate family member of the director, was not
an affiliate or executive officer of another company which was indebted
to the Company, or to which the Company was indebted, where the total amount
of indebtedness (to and of the Company) exceeded two percent (2%) of the
total consolidated assets of such other company or the Company;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
the director, and each immediate family member of the director, was not
an officer, director or trustee of a charitable organization where the
Company's (or an affiliated charitable foundation's) annual charitable
contributions to such charitable organization exceeded the greater of $1
million or two percent (2%) of that organization's consolidated gross revenues;
and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
the director has not been a party to a personal services contract with
the Company, the Chairman, any executive officer of the Company or any
affiliate of the Company.</li>
</ul>
<b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>For purposes of these
categorical standards, (i) an "immediate family member" of a director includes
a director's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers and fathers-in-law,
sons and daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law, and anyone (other
than domestic employees) who share such director's home and (ii) an "affiliate"
includes a general partner of a partnership, a managing member of a limited
liability company or a shareholder of a corporation controlling more than
10% of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding common stock.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Board will annually review
all relationships between the Company and its outside directors and publicly
disclose whether its outside directors meet the Board's determination as
to the independence of the outside directors.

advised of any communication that alleges management misconduct or raises
legal, ethical or compliance concerns about Company policies and practices.

Success Sharing Program - Performance Incentive Plan (referred to as the
Success Sharing Plan) which provides awards to substantially all of the
Company's employees if the Company achieves certain operating and financial
goals. Amounts in 2004 for Mr. Tague were also paid under UAL Corporation
Retention and Recognition Bonus Plan ("KERP"). Amounts for Messrs. McDonald
and Brace in 2003 were paid under the KERP.</font>

are payments to the named executive officers to cover their tax liabilities
incurred in connection with the free transportation and cargo shipment
on United that it provides to the officers, except for Mr. Tague, who also
received $4,793 in 2004 to cover tax liabilities associated with relocation
and temporary living expenses.</font>

had earned an award valued at $2,083,492 under the ULS long-term incentive
plan ("LTIP") which was adopted in 2000 for the net value created of ULS
asset portfolio during the performance period under the plan. The original
award was reduced significantly from its stated dollar amount and the unvested
portion was forfeited when the LTIP was amended in June 2003. This award
was to have been paid upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy and
subject to Mr. Hacker's continued employment. Subsequent to the Company's
exit from Chapter 11, the LTIP was amended to, among other things, eliminate
awards for all current and former officers of UAL and United. Consequently,
the award shown in 2003 will not be paid to Mr. Hacker under the LTIP.</font>

paid by the Company for group variable life insurance. Amount in 2003 includes

information about stock options held at the end of 2005 by the officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table. These are options to purchase
the Company's common stock that were outstanding before it emerged from
bankruptcy in 2006. No options were exercised by these officers in 2005
as the option exercise price was higher than the fair market value of the
underlying stock at year-end. The options were all canceled in connection
with the Company's emergence from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company terminated and
replaced its under-funded U.S. defined benefit pension plans, including
the plan affecting the officers named in the Summary Compensation Table.
Thus, these officers are no longer entitled to receive any payments from
the Company under the plan which was terminated on June 30, 2005. For more
information, see Note 15 "Retirement and Postretirement Plans" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>This table is
based on information for a defined benefit plan that was terminated on
June 30 2005 and is therefore no longer relevant. It assumes retirement
at age 65 and selection of a straight life annuity (other annuity options
were available, which would reduce the amounts shown).&#160; The amount
of the normal retirement benefit under the since terminated plan was the
product of 1.63% multiplied by years of credited participation in the plan
multiplied by final average pay (highest five of last ten years of covered
compensation).&#160; The retirement benefit amount was not offset by the
participant's social security benefit.&#160; The compensation used in calculating
benefits under the plan (since terminated) was base salary and performance
incentive pay. Under the qualified plan, years of participation as of the
June 30, 2005 termination of the plan for persons named in the compensation
table are as follows: Mr. Hacker - 12 years; Mr. Brace - 17 years; Mr.
McDonald - 34 years; Mr. Tilton - 2 years and Mr. Tague - 1 year. The amounts
shown do not reflect limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (the
"Code") on retirement benefits that may be paid under plans qualified under
the Code.&#160; The Company has historically provided under non-qualified
plans the portion of the retirement benefits earned under the pension plan
that would otherwise be subject to Code limitations; however, in February
2005, the Company terminated the non-qualified pension plans for its salaried
and management employees that include the officers named in the Summary
Compensation Table.
</p><p><b><u>Employment Contracts and Arrangements</u></b>
</p><p><b>Mr. Tilton's Employment Agreement</b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Mr. Tilton was elected
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company on September
2, 2002. The Company entered into a five-year employment agreement with
Mr. Tilton in 2002, which provided a base salary of $950,000 and a $3 million
signing bonus. This agreement was amended on December 8, 2002 and again
on February 17, 2003 in connection with the Company's bankruptcy filing.
The amended agreement provided for an annual base salary of $845,500 (which
reflected an 11% reduction from the original amount of $950,000), and provided
for salary increases as part of the normal salary program for the Company's
senior executives. On April 4, 2003, Mr. Tilton agreed to an additional
14% reduction in his original base salary of $950,000, thereby reducing
his salary from $845,500 to $712,500 effective April 1, 2003. In April
2004, the Human Resources Subcommittee of the Company's Board of Directors
approved the restoration of Mr. Tilton's salary to $845,500. However, in
the wake of the ATSB's rejection of our application for a federal loan
guarantee, Mr. Tilton made the personal decision to reduce his salary and
have it revert by $133,000 annually to its previous level of $712,500 effective
August 1, 2004. Effective January 1, 2005, consistent with reductions imposed
on the entire salaried and management work force, Mr. Tilton's base salary
was further reduced by 15% from $712,500 to $605,625 where it remains today.
The overall reduction in Mr. Tilton's salary between September 2, 2002
and January 1, 2006 was $344,375, or approximately 36% of his original
salary of $950,000.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Under the terms of
the agreement, Mr. Tilton also received options to purchase 1,150,000 shares
of old UAL common stock.&#160; The exercise price for the options was $3.03,
which was the average of the high and low sales price of the old common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange on August 30 and September 3, 2002.&#160;
The options were canceled as a result of the Company's exit from bankruptcy.&#160;
The Company also agreed to reimburse Mr. Tilton for his and his family's
relocation expenses, including a cash payment to cover his income tax liability
for the relocation reimbursement.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Under his employment
agreement, Mr. Tilton is eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus
with a target percentage equal to 100% of his base salary.&#160; He is
entitled to an additional 100% over this target bonus amount for superior
performance. In lieu of this individually-oriented approach, Mr. Tilton
has chosen to participate in the Company's Success Sharing Plan (at participation
rates included in his contract discussed above) as his only cash-based
incentive opportunity. Under this plan, all of the employees of the Company
receive award pay-outs if the Company achieves certain operating and financial
targets.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>If Mr. Tilton's employment
is terminated by UAL without "cause," or by him for "good reason," or if
there is a "change in control," UAL will pay him his base salary as reduced
by the December 8<sup>th</sup> amendment, any annual bonus and any earned
and vested benefits he may be entitled to through the termination date.&#160;
UAL will also pay Mr. Tilton a lump sum payment equal to his base salary
reduced by the December 8<sup>th</sup> amendment and target bonus multiplied
by the greater of (1) the remaining term of his agreement or (2) three
years.&#160; Mr. Tilton's other benefits will be continued for this period.&#160;
All long-term incentive awards will immediately vest on the termination
date, including any unvested stock options or restricted stock awards.&#160;
Under Mr. Tilton's agreement, a "change of control" is defined as: (1)
a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all the Company's assets
in which the voting securities of the Company immediately before the merger,
consolidation or sale represent less than 80% of the voting power after
the merger, consolidation or sale; (2) the acquisition by a person or group
of 25% or more of the voting securities of the Company; (3) the UAL shareholders
approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation of the Company; (4) a
change in the majority of the Board over a 24-month period (unless the
new directors were approved by a two-thirds majority of prior directors);
or (5) any other event or transaction that the Board of Directors determines
is a "change of control".
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>As reported in the
Company's prior Form 10-Ks, in consideration of projected retirement benefits
foregone by Mr. Tilton as a result of his resignation from his prior employer
and acceptance of the Company's employment offer, $4.5 million was paid
into three secular trusts on Mr. Tilton's behalf vesting over three years
beginning September 2, 2003.
</p><p><b><u>Human Resources Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>The Company has a
separately designated standing Human Resources Committee. The members of
the Human Resources Committee are W. James Farrell (Chairman), Richard
J. Almeida, Mark A. Bathurst, Stephen R. Canale, Janet Langford Kelly,
James J. O'Connor, John H. Walker and David J. Vitale.&#160; The Company
also has a Human Resources Subcommittee, members of which are W. James
Farrell (Chairman), Richard J. Almeida, Janet Langford Kelly, James J.
O'Connor, John H. Walker and David J. Vitale.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Mr. Canale and Captain
Bathurst serve on the Human Resources Committee, but not the Human Resources
Subcommittee.&#160; Mr. Canale and Captain Bathurst are employees of United.
Captain Bathurst is the Chairman of the ALPA-MEC and an officer of ALPA.
ALPA and the Company are parties to a collective bargaining agreement for
our pilots represented by ALPA.&#160; Mr. Canale is President and Directing
General Chairman of the IAM District Lodge 141.&#160; The IAM and the Company
are parties to collective bargaining agreements for our ramp and stores,
public contact employees, food service, security officers, maintenance
instructors, fleet technical instructors and Mileage Plus employees represented
by the IAM.
</p><p><b><u>Director Compensation</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>We do not pay directors
who are also employees of the Company or its subsidiaries additional compensation
for their service as directors. Effective February 1, 2006, compensation
for non-employee directors includes the following:
</p><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>annual retainer of $20,000;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
&#160;&#160;&#160; $1,000 for each board and board committee meeting attended;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
&#160;&#160;&#160; annual retainer of $5,000 to committee chairmen (other
than chairs of the Human Resource</li>
<ul>Subcommittee and the Audit Committee);</ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
&#160;&#160;&#160; annual retainer of $10,000 to the chairman of the Audit
Committee;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
&#160;&#160;&#160; annual retainer of $10,000 to the Lead Director; and</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
&#160;&#160;&#160; reimbursement of expenses of attending board and committee
meetings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b> In addition, each of
our non-employee directors who were directors upon the Company's emergence
from bankruptcy received a grant of 10,000 shares of UAL common stock,
$.01 par value, on February 1, 2006.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We consider it important
for our directors to understand our business and have exposure to our operations
and employees. For this reason, we provide free transportation and free
cargo shipment on United to our directors and their spouses and eligible
dependent children. We reimburse our directors for federal and state income
taxes resulting from actual use of the travel and shipment privileges.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The cost of this policy in
2005 for each director who served as a director in 2005, including cash
payments made in January 2006 for income tax liability, was as follows:

<b><u>1995 Directors Plan</u></b>
<p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Under the UAL Corporation
1995 Directors Plan (which was terminated upon our exit from bankruptcy
on February 1, 2006) each non-employee director was granted 400 shares
of common stock and 189 deferred stock units (each unit representing the
right to receive a share of common stock at a future date) during each
year that he or she is an outside director of the Company.&#160; If any
outside director is not a director for the entire calendar year, the award
of deferred stock units will be prorated.&#160; Each outside director could
elect to forego the receipt of all or any portion of cash fees payable
to him or her for service as a director (i.e., meeting fees and committee
fees) and instead receive shares of the common stock equivalent in value
to the cash fees based on the fair market value of a share of common stock
on the date the cash fee is payable to the director.&#160; The outside
directors could also elect to defer the receipt of cash fees payable as
well as the stock award and the deferred stock units to be granted in any
year, which deferral may be paid after the director leaves the Board, either
as a lump sum or in ten or less annual payments.&#160; The 1995 Directors
Plan authorized the issuance of up to 400,000 shares of Old Common Stock
(either through use of treasury shares or open market purchases) and, as
of December 31, 2005, 38,172 shares remained available for future awards.
After the Company's filing for bankruptcy, the Nominating/Governance Committee
determined not to issue stock to the directors under this plan. This plan
was terminated upon our exit from bankruptcy.
</p><p><b><u>2002 Share Incentive Plan</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>The 2002 Share Incentive
Plan (which was terminated upon our exit from bankruptcy on February 1,
2006) permitted the award of nonqualified stock options and restricted
shares to participants as well as stock appreciation rights. The exercise
price of a nonqualified stock option could not be less than the fair market
value of a share of UAL common stock on the date of grant and the exercise
period cannot exceed ten years.&#160; Restricted shares issued under the
2002 Share Incentive Plan vested over a time period established by the
applicable committee (not to exceed ten years) and were subject to certain
transfer restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior
to vesting.&#160; In addition, the Human Resources Subcommittee of the
Company's Board of Directors could have granted to participants other awards,
including dividends and dividend equivalents and other awards that are
valued in whole or part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, the
fair market value of shares of UAL common stock. The 2002 Share Incentive
Plan authorized the issuance of 12,500,000 shares of Old Common Stock as
well as 267,366 shares that were available for issuance as awards under
the 1998 Restricted Stock Plan as of July 31, 2002 and, as of December
31, 2005, approximately 12,205,106 shares remained available for future
awards under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan. Only treasury shares could
have been issued under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan. The terms of the
2002 Share Incentive Plan also provided that any shares awarded under the
1998 Restricted Stock Plan or the 2002 Share Incentive Plan that were subsequently
forfeited, expired or canceled without the delivery of shares of common
stock or withheld by UAL to satisfy any applicable tax withholding obligations
would be available again for issuance under the plan. There were no awards
made under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan in 2005. This plan was terminated
upon our exit from bankruptcy.
</p><p><b><u>2006 Director Equity Incentive Plan</u></b>
</p><p>The UAL Corporation 2006 Director Equity Incentive Plan (the "DEIP")
authorizes the Nominating/Governance Committee of the Board (the "Governance
Committee") to grant equity-based awards ("DEIP Awards") to non-employee
directors of the Company. The purpose of the DEIP is to attract and retain
the services of experienced and knowledgeable non-employee directors by
providing such directors with greater flexibility in the form of timing
and receipt of compensation for their service on the Board and an opportunity
to obtain greater proprietary interest in the Company's long-term success
and progress through the receipt of equity-based awards, aligning such
directors' interests more closely with the interests of the Company's stockholders.
The DEIP became effective upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy
and will remain in effect as long as any Awards remain outstanding. The
Company reserves the right to terminate the DEIP at any time, without prejudice
in any adverse way to the holders of any DEIP Awards then outstanding,
by delivery of a written notice by its authorized officers to the Governance
Committee, adopted in the manner of an amendment. The aggregate number
of shares reserved for grant under the DEIP is 175,000 shares of common
stock. It is intended that the DEIP and all DEIP Awards determined to be
subject to Section 409A of the Code will comply in form and operation with
the requirements of Section 409A.
</p><p>The DEIP will be administered by the Governance Committee. The Governance
Committee has the sole discretionary power and authority to make all determinations
necessary for administration of the DEIP, except as otherwise provided
in the DEIP, including the power and authority to make or modify such plan
rules as the Governance Committee determines to be consistent with the
terms of the DEIP (the "Plan Rules") and to limit or modify application
of provisions of the DEIP whenever advisable to facilitate tax deferral
treatment for DEIP Awards to non-U.S. resident participants.
</p><p>All non-employee directors of the Company are eligible to become participants
in the DEIP. The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board will select
from time to time, from among all eligible individuals, the persons who
will be granted a DEIP Award. The DEIP authorizes the Governance Committee
to grant any of a variety of incentive awards to participants, including
the following:
</p><ul>
<li>
non-qualified stock options,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
stock appreciation rights, which provide the participant the right to receive
the excess (if any) of the fair market value of a specified number of shares
of common stock at the time of exercise over the grant price of the stock
appreciation right,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
stock awards to be granted at no cost to the participant, including grants
in the form of Restricted Stock and Unrestricted Stock,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
annual compensation in the form of credits to a participant's share account
established under the DEIP, and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
shares of common stock in lieu of receipt of all or any portion of cash
amounts payable by the Company to a participant ("Director Cash Compensation")
including retainer fees, board attendance fees and committee fees (but
excluding expense reimbursements and similar items).</li>
</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The shares may be issued from
authorized and unissued shares of common stock or from the Company's treasury
stock. The exercise price for each underlying share of common stock under
all options and stock appreciation rights awarded under the DEIP will not
be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date
of grant.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Each option granted under
the DEIP will generally expire 10 years after its date of grant. If the
participant ceases to serve as a director for any reason other than a "qualified
retirement" (i.e., has attained age 60 and has completed five years or
more of continuous service as a member of the Board), then the option will
remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of five years after
the date of separation or the remaining term of the option. If the participant
ceases to serve as a director due to a "qualified retirement" then all
of such participant's options will become immediately exercisable in full
and will remain exercisable until the expiration of the options.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the event a participant
experiences a separation from service by reason of death or disability,
all outstanding stock appreciation rights then held by a participant will
become immediately exercisable in full and will remain exercisable for
a period ending on the earlier of 12 months after such termination or the
expiration date of the stock appreciation rights and all of such participant's
restricted stock will become fully vested. In the event of a qualified
retirement, all outstanding stock appreciation rights then held by the
participant will become immediately exercisable in full and will remain
exercisable in full until the expiration date of such stock appreciation
rights and all of such participant's restricted stock will become fully
vested. In the event of a separation from service for reasons other than
death, disability or qualified retirement, all outstanding stock appreciation
rights then held by the participant, to the extent exercisable as of the
date of separation, will remain exercisable for a period ending on the
earlier of three months after such termination or the expiration date of
the stock appreciation rights and all of such participant's restricted
stock that has not vested as of such separation from service will be forfeited.
A determination by the Board that a participant's actions constitutes "cause"
will result in all rights of the participant under the DEIP being terminated
and forfeited.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For each participant, the
Committee will establish and maintain a Cash Account and a Share Account
to evidence the deferred amount credited with respect to such participant
pursuant to the terms of the DEIP. Each participant may elect, in accordance
with the terms of the DEIP, to defer the receipt of all or any portion
of his or her Director Cash Compensation relating to services performed
and Director Cash Compensation earned during each calendar year and such
participant may elect, in accordance with and subject to the Plan Rules,
how the deferral will be allocated among his or her Cash Account and Share
Account. Participants may also elect to defer receipt of all or any portion
of the Unrestricted Stock or Restricted Stock, and any such deferrals will
be credited to such participant's Share Account. As of the last day of
each calendar quarter, a participant's Cash Account will be credited with
interest, calculated on the balance in the Cash Account as of the last
day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, at the Bloomberg Prime
Rate Composite in effect on such date.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Distributions from a participant's
Share Account and Cash Account will generally be made or commence as soon
as administratively practicable after the first day of the calendar year
after which such participant completely terminates his relationship with
the Company and its affiliates (whether as a director, non-employee consultant
or employee). A participant's Cash Account and Share Account will be distributed
in a lump sum payment unless the participant has elected to receive his
or her distribution in the form of annual installment payments for a period
of not more than 10 years. Any distribution from a participant's Cash Account
will be made in cash only and any distribution from a participant's Share
Account will generally be made in whole Shares only. Notwithstanding any
distribution election by a participant to the contrary, a distribution
will be made to a participant from his or her account if the participant
submits a written request to the Committee and the Committee determines
that the Participant has experienced an unforeseeable emergency within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Upon certain defined change
of control events, (i) all options and stock appreciation rights will become
immediately exercisable in full and will remain exercisable in accordance
with their terms, (ii) all Restricted Stock will become immediately fully
vested and non-forfeitable, (iii) all deferral accounts will become immediately
fully vested and non-forfeitable, and (iv) all deferred amounts credited
to a participant's Cash Account and Share Account will become immediately
due and payable to the Participant. In addition, if a change of control
occurs, then the Board may determine with respect to some or all participants
to cash out all or any portion of the outstanding options and stock appreciation
rights.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The number of shares with
respect to which DEIP Awards may be granted under the DEIP, the number
of shares of common stock subject to any outstanding DEIP Award, and the
nature of the securities which may be issued under the DEIP or any outstanding
DEIP Award in each case may be adjusted by the Board as a result of any
reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, rights offering, divestiture
or extraordinary dividend or any other similar change in the Company's
corporate structure or the common stock.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company reserves the
right to amend the DEIP at any time to any extent that it may deem advisable.
To be effective, an amendment must be in writing and approved or ratified
in advance by the Board and executed in the name of the Company by its
Chief Executive Officer. No amendment will have any retroactive effect
in any manner that deprives any participant of any benefit to which he
or she is entitled immediately prior to the effective date of the amendment.
</p><p><b><u>2006 Management Equity Incentive Plan</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The UAL Corporation 2006
Management Equity Incentive Plan (the "MEIP") authorizes the Human Resources
Subcommittee of the Board (the "HR Subcommittee") to grant equity-based
and other performance-based awards ("Awards") to executive officers and
other key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries following the Company's
emergence from bankruptcy. The purpose of the MEIP is to attract and retain
outstanding individuals as officers and key employees of the Company and
its subsidiaries. The MEIP aims to align the interests of the Company's
senior leadership with those of the Company's shareholders through compensation
that is based on shares of the Company's common stock and to incentivize
these individuals by providing them opportunities to acquire shares of
common stock on advantageous terms. The MEIP is designed to give the HR
Subcommittee flexibility in structuring awards to achieve these objectives.
The MEIP became effective as of the effective date of the Company's confirmed
plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and
will remain in effect as long as any Awards remain outstanding. The Board
reserves the right to terminate the MEIP at any time without prejudice
in any adverse way to the holders of any Awards then outstanding. The aggregate
number of shares reserved for grant under the MEIP is 9,825,000 shares
of common stock, as may be adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, reorganization, merger or other subdivision or combination
of the common stock. It is intended that the MEIP and all Awards determined
to be subject to Section 409A of the Code will comply in form and operation
with the requirements of Section 409A.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The MEIP will be administered
by the HR Subcommittee. The HR Subcommittee has the power to interpret
the MEIP and any Awards granted under the MEIP and to determine the terms
and conditions of Awards to be granted under the MEIP and to make all other
determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the MEIP.
The HR Subcommittee may not, however, without the prior approval of the
Company's stockholders, seek to effect any re-pricing of any previously
granted options, the exercise price of which is greater than the fair market
value of the underlying common stock (the "Underwater Restriction").
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All executive officers and
other key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to
become participants in the MEIP. The HR Subcommittee will select from time
to time, from among all eligible individuals, the persons who will be granted
an Award. The MEIP authorizes the HR Subcommittee to grant any of a variety
of incentive Awards to participants, including the following:
</p><ul>
<li>
stock options, including both tax qualified and non-qualified options,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
stock appreciation rights, which provide the participant the right to receive
the excess (if any) of the fair market value of a specified number of shares
of common stock at the time of exercise over the grant price of the stock
appreciation right,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
stock awards to be granted at no cost to the participant, including grants
in the form of (i) an immediate transfer of shares which are subject to
forfeiture and certain transfer restrictions ("Restricted Stock") and (ii)
an immediate transfer of shares which are not subject to forfeiture or
a deferred transfer of shares if and when the conditions specified by the
HR Subcommittee are met ("Unrestricted Stock"), and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
performance-based awards, in which the HR Subcommittee may grant a stock
award that will entitle the holder to receive a specified number of shares
of common stock, or the cash value thereof, if certain performance goals
are met.</li>
</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The shares may be issued from
authorized and unissued shares of common stock or from the Company's treasury
stock. The exercise price for each underlying share of common stock under
all options and stock appreciation rights awarded under the MEIP will not
be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date
of grant.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the event of a participant's
termination of employment by reason of death, disability or qualified retirement
(i.e., termination of employment at or after attaining age 55 and completing
10 years of service with the Company or an affiliate or termination of
employment after attaining age 65 with five years of service), (i) all
outstanding options and stock appreciation rights then held by a participant
will become immediately exercisable in full and will remain exercisable
for a period ending on the earlier of 12 months after such event or the
expiration date of the options or stock appreciation rights, except that
in the case of a qualified retirement, all outstanding options and stock
appreciation rights then held by a participant will remain exercisable
for a period ending on the expiration date of the options or stock appreciation
rights, (ii) all restricted shares then held by the participant will become
fully vested, and (iii) any conditions with respect to the issuance of
shares of common stock under any performance-based awards which are based
on a performance period will lapse with respect to that portion equal to
the ratio of the full months of the participant's service within the performance
period to the total months of the performance period. In the event of a
participant's termination of employment for reasons other than death, disability
or retirement, all restricted shares and other Awards then held by such
participant that have not vested as of such termination of employment will
be forfeited and all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights
then held by such participant will, to the extent exercisable at the time
of such termination, remain exercisable for a period ending on the earlier
of three months after such termination or the expiration date of the underlying
options or stock appreciation rights and all remaining options and stock
appreciation rights will be forfeited. A termination of a participant's
employment for cause will result in all rights of the participant under
the MEIP to be terminated and forfeited.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Upon certain defined change
of control events, (i) all options and stock appreciation rights will become
immediately exercisable in full and will remain exercisable in accordance
with their terms, (ii) all restricted shares will become immediately fully
vested and non-forfeitable and (iii) any conditions to the issuance of
shares of common stock under any performance awards will lapse. In addition,
if a change of control occurs, then the HR Subcommittee may determine with
respect to some or all participants to cash out all or any portion of the
outstanding options, stock appreciation rights or share-based performance
awards.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The number of shares with
respect to which Awards may be granted under the MEIP, the number of shares
of common stock subject to any outstanding Award, and the nature of the
securities which may be issued under the MEIP or any outstanding Award
in each case may be adjusted by the HR Subcommittee as a result of stock
splits, stock dividends, or other subdivisions or combinations of the common
stock, or reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, split-ups, spin-offs,
dividends or reclassifications affecting the Company. In addition, upon
the occurrence of such events, the HR Subcommittee has the discretion to
cancel or terminate outstanding Awards in exchange for cash or other securities
as determined by the HR Subcommittee to be equitable.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Board may, from time
to time, in its discretion, amend the MEIP in whole or in part, but no
such amendment will be made which adversely affects the rights of a participant
under any outstanding Award without the consent of the affected participants,
and no such amendment will be effective without the approval of the stockholders
of the Company if (i) stockholder approval is required pursuant to Section
422 of the Code or the rules of any national securities exchange or the
NASDAQ National Market, as applicable, or (ii) any amendments seek to modify
the Underwater Restriction or the acceleration of vesting provisions with
respect to a change of control.

related to 2005 and 2004 consist of audits of the Company's consolidated
financial statements, limited reviews of the Company's consolidated quarterly
financial statements, statutory audits of the Schedule of Passenger Facility
Charges and statutory audits of certain subsidiaries' financial statements.
The 2005 and 2004 audit fees also include the impact of the attestation
work performed by Deloitte &amp; Touche related to Sarbanes-Oxley.
</p><p><b><u>AUDIT RELATED FEES</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Fees for audit-related
services billed in 2005 and 2004 consisted of audits of employee benefit
plans, the United Airlines Foundation, financial accounting and reporting
consultations, Sarbanes-Oxley Act assistance and bankruptcy accounting
consultation.
</p><p><b><u>TAX FEES</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Fees for tax services
in 2005 and 2004 consisted of assistance with tax issues in certain foreign
jurisdictions, preparation of expatriate tax returns, state tax returns
and bankruptcy tax assistance.
</p><p><b><u>ALL OTHER FEES</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Fees for all other
services billed in 2005 and 2004 consisted of the preparation of employee
payroll tax filings, annual tax software license fees and expatriate tax
consultations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All of the services in 2005
and 2004 under the Audit Related, Tax and All Other Fees categories above
have been approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c)
of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act.
</p><p><b><u>Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy and Procedures</u>.</b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>The Audit Committee
of the UAL Board of Directors adopted a policy on pre-approval of services
of independent accountants in October 2002. The policy provides that the
Audit Committee shall pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be
provided to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates by its auditors.
The process by which this is carried out is as follows:
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>For recurring services,
the Audit Committee reviews and pre-approves Deloitte &amp; Touche's annual
audit services and employee benefit plan audits in conjunction with the
Committee's annual appointment of the outside auditors. The materials include
a description of the services along with related fees. The Committee also
reviews and pre-approves other classes of recurring services along with
fee thresholds for pre-approved services. In the event that the pre-approval
fee thresholds are met and additional services are required prior to the
next scheduled Committee meeting, pre-approvals of additional services
follow the process described below.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Any requests for audit,
audit-related, tax and other services not contemplated with the recurring
services approval described above must be submitted to the Audit Committee
for specific pre-approval and cannot commence until such approval has been
granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings.
However, the authority to grant specific pre-approval between meetings,
as necessary, has been delegated to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Chairman must update the Committee at the next regularly scheduled
meeting of any services that were granted specific pre-approval.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On a periodic basis, the
Audit Committee reviews the status of services and fees incurred year-to-date
and a list of newly pre-approved services since its last regularly scheduled
meeting.
