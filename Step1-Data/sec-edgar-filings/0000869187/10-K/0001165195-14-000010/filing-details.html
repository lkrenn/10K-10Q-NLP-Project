<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight:bold">
      Item
      1. Business.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia Air Lines, Inc. (the
      "Company" or "Baltia" or "Baltia Air Lines") is a Part 121
      (heavy jet operator) start-up United States airline with
      Government fitness approval and is currently conducting the
      FAA Air Carrier Certification. Upon completion of the Air
      Carrier Certification, Baltia will commence scheduled
      non-stop service from its Base of Operations at Terminal 4,
      JFK Int'l Airport in New York to Pulkovo II Int'l Airport of
      St. Petersburg.Baltia Air Lines, Inc. was organized in the
      State of New York on August 24, 1989.
    </p>
<p>
       On December 19, 2008, the
      U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued its Order to
      Show Cause, finding that Baltia Air Lines is fit, willing and
      able to engage in international air transport of persons,
      property and mail. Baltia was awarded the non-stop route from
      JFK International Airport, New York, New York to Pulkovo
      International Airport, St. Petersburg Russia. Baltia was also
      authorized for worldwide charter services. Baltia had filed
      its application with the DOT in October 2007.
    </p>
<p>
       On March 20, 2009 the DOT
      awarded Baltia Air Lines its initial frequencies for flights
      from JFK to St. Petersburg.
    </p>
<p>
       In the last quarter of 2010,
      we purchased a Boeing 747 aircraft from Kalitta
      Air.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia carries $500,000,000
      aircraft liability insurance, and has placed $1.2 billion
      airline liability insurance through JLT Aerospace meeting the
      regulatory requirement in preparation for the commencement of
      revenue service. The Company will carry airline liability
      insurance as required for a US airline by DOT
      regulation.
    </p>
<p>
       Following the commencement
      of service on the JFK-St. Petersburg route, Baltia's
      objective is to develop its route network to Russia, Latvia,
      Ukraine, and Belarus.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia intends to provide
      full service, i.e. passenger, cargo and mail. Baltia has two
      registered trademarks "BALTIA" and "VOYAGER CLASS" and five
      trademarks are subject to registration.
    </p>
<p>
       There is currently no
      non-stop service from JFK to St. Petersburg. Connecting
      service is provided mainly by foreign carriers. Finnair,
      Lufthansa and SAS are the leading competitors in the
      US-Russia market. KLM, British Airways, Air France, Austrian
      Airlines, and Swiss International also provide service.
      However, foreign carriers are required to have intermediate
      stops at transit airports in their respective countries
      (Helsinki, Frankfurt, Stockholm, Copenhagen, etc.) because
      they are "third nation" airlines and as such cannot fly
      directly between the US and Russia (only a US airline as well
      as a reciprocating Russian airline is eligible to fly
      nonstop). Delta and two Russian airlines, Aeroflot and
      Transaero, currently operate between JFK and Moscow. With the
      exception of the JFK-Moscow route, there exists no non- stop
      competitive air transportation service on the routes for
      which Baltia intends to apply.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia's objective is to
      establish itself as the leading non-stop carrier in the
      market niche over the North Atlantic with operations with
      profitable growth over time. In order to accomplish this
      objective, we intend to establish and maintain high quality
      service standards which we believe will be competitive with
      the European airlines currently providing connecting
       flights. Baltia does not
      expect to be in direct competition with deep discount
      airlines, including several East European airlines and the
      offspring of the former Soviet airline Aeroflot, which
      provide connecting flights.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia intends to provide
      First, Business, and Voyager Class accommodations. Baltia's
      passenger market strategy is tailored to particular
      preferences of the various segments of its customer base,
      with marketing attention particularly focused on American
      business travelers with interests in Russia who require high
      quality, non-stop service from the US to Russia.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia's initial marketing
      strategy is based on existing agencies specializing in the
      market, selected travel and business publications,
      supplemented by direct mailings to corporate travel planners,
      and individual American businesses that are currently
      involved in Russia. Soon after the inauguration of flight
      service, Baltia plans to implement its frequent flyer
      program. As the marketing matures, Baltia plans to advertise
      to the general public throughout the US, and in Russia.
      Baltia also plans to sponsor selected industry and trade
      events in the US and in St. Petersburg.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia intends to provide
      customer service and reservations centers in New York and in
      St. Petersburg, to list Baltia's schedules and tariffs in the
      Official Airline Guide, and provide world-wide access to
      reservations on Baltia's flights through a major Computer
      Reservations and Ticketing System ("CRS").
    </p>
<p>
       The Company intends to
      activate its reservations service when the DOT issues its
      order authorizing Baltia to sell tickets (expected to be
      approximately 30 to 45 days before the inaugural
      flight).
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia has identified the
      following market segments in the U.S.-Russia market: (i)
      Business Travelers, (ii) General Tourism, (iii) Ethnic
      Travelers, (iv) Special Interest Groups, (v) Professional
      Exchanges, and (vi) Government and Diplomatic Travel.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia believes that the
      direct non-stop service to be offered by it will be superior
      to the stop-over service currently offered by foreign
      airlines. A comparison between the two services with respect
      to passenger convenience and cargo transport efficiency is
      set forth below.
    </p>
<p>
       BALTIA - US flag, non-stop
      service:
    </p>
<p>
       With non-stop service, a
      passenger can fly from JFK to St. Petersburg in about 8 hours
      in a Boeing B747 wide body airplane. Cargo arrives
      containerized, palletized, and secure.
    </p>
<p>
       Foreign, stop-over
      journeys:
    </p>
<p>
       With stop-over service, it
      would take a passenger 10 to 18 hours to fly through
      Helsinki, Copenhagen, Moscow, or Frankfurt on a foreign
      carrier. In addition, passengers must change to narrow-body
      aircraft at a layover airport. Cargo is "broken up" and
      manually loaded onto narrow-body aircraft, or trucked from
      Helsinki.
    </p>
<p>
       Because of the increased
      reliability and comfort of a non-stop flight, Baltia expects
      to capture a portion of the existing traffic.
    </p>
<p>
       With the Boeing 747
      wide-body aircraft Baltia intends to provide cargo service
      from JFK to St. Petersburg, offering containers, pallets, and
      block space arrangements. Baltia expects to carry contract
      cargo for express shippers. Baltia also plans to market its
      own "Baltia Courier", "Baltia Express", and "Baltia Priority"
      express service for letters and packages. Baltia also expects
      revenues from diplomatic mail and cargo, under the Fly
      America Act.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia has passenger service
      and ground service arrangements at JFK and at Pulkovo II
      Airport in St. Petersburg. As a US carrier flying into a
      foreign country, Baltia will be eligible to the same degree
      of priority that a foreign carrier receives when arriving in
      the US.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia intends to start the
      JFK-St. Petersburg service with one round- trip flight per
      week, then increase the frequency to three round trips, and
      then to five round trips.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia plans to build
      operating modules and apply them in developing new markets.
      Once established, Baltia plans to duplicate its JFK-St.
      Petersburg standards on flights on other transatlantic
      routes.
    </p>
<p>
       Additional revenues from
      charter flying. Concurrently with its Part 121 air
      carrier certification ("Part 121") for scheduled service,
      Baltia is certifying for world wide charter service. Baltia
      plans to utilize aircraft time available between scheduled
      service, to earn additional revenues from charters. We may
      also qualify our aircraft for military contracts.
    </p>
<p>
       As of December 31, 2013,
      Baltia's staff of thirty-one includes professionals who have
      extensive major US airline experience in aircraft
      maintenance, airline operations, airline regulatory
      compliance, reservation, info technology, passenger service,
      and administration.

       The Company was organized in
      the State of New York on August 24, 1989. Its objective is to
      provide scheduled air transportation from the U.S. to Russia,
      and former Soviet Union countries.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia is currently in Phase
      II of the FAA Air Carrier Certification process. Upon
      completion of the Air Carrier Certification, Baltia intends
      to commence scheduled non-stop service from its Base of
      Operations at Terminal 4, JFK Int'l Airport in New York to
      Pulkovo II Int'l Airport of St. Petersburg.
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia intends to provide
      full service, i.e. passenger, cargo and mail, and will not be
      dependent upon one or a few major customers. Baltia has two
      registered trademarks "BALTIA" and "VOYAGER CLASS" and five
      trademarks subject to registration.
    </p>
<p>
       The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expenses, which would allow it to cover its operational costs, and it has incurred operating losses and experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception.  The Company has funded its activities through December 31, 2013 almost exclusively from debt and equity financings.  For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company raised approximately $4.1 and $3.6 million, respectively, from private placements, funds needed to continue with the certification process, a process that must be completed before it can launch nonstop revenue service from JFK to St Petersburg, Russia with its747 aircraft. In addition to raising funds from private placements, the Company supplemented the financing of its ongoing operations through the issuance of common stock to pay certain operating expenses.</p>
<p>
The Company's operational success may be dependent upon its timely procuring significant external debt and/or equity financing to fund its immediate and nearer-term operations, and subsequently realizing operating cash flows from ticket sales sufficient to sustain its longer-term operations and growth initiatives.

       PLAN OF OPERATION
    </p>
<p>
       In order to meet its ongoing operating cash requirements, management's plans include financing activities such as private placements of its common stock and the continued issuance of common stock for services rendered by vendors, consultants, and other professionals. As indicated above, we continued to finance our operations through the issuance of our common stock during 2013 and 2012. Until revenue operations begin, our monthly expenditures for administrative and regulatory compliance can be controlled at about $350,000-$500,000.  At the time flight service is inaugurated,  the Company plans to employee approximately 20 management and 45 staff personnel.
    </p>
<p>
       While the Company believes it will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved and that it will succeed in its future operations. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fund operations

       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING  POLICIES
    </p>
<p>
       Our discussion and analysis
      of our financial condition and results of operations are
      based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared
      in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
      in the U.S. The preparation of our financial statements
      requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
      liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
      statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
      during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and
      assumptions are continually re-evaluated based upon available
      information and experience. Because of the use of estimates
      inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results
      could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant
      judgment and estimates are used include, but are not limited
      to, valuation of long-lived assets and deferred income
      taxes.
    </p>
<p align="LEFT" style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight:bold;">
<i>Valuation of Long-Lived
      Assets</i>
</p>
<p>
       We review the recoverability of our long- lived assets, including buildings, equipment and intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. Our primary measure of fair value is based on discounted cash flows. The measurement of impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related to long-lived assets, as well as other fair value determinations
    </p>
<p>
      We amortize the costs of other intangibles (excluding goodwill) over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment, at least annually, and written down to fair value as required
    </p>
<p align="LEFT" style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight:bold;">
<i>Stock-Based Compensation Plans</i>
</p>
<p>
       The Company complies with
      FASB ASC Topic 718 <i>Compensation - Stock Compensation,</i> which
      establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in
      which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or
      services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity
      incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are
      based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or
      that may be settled by the issuance of those equity
      instruments. FASB ASC Topic 718 focuses primarily on
      accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains
      employee services in share-based payment transactions. FASB
      ASC Topic 718 requires an entity to measure the cost of
      employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
      instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award
      (with limited exceptions). That cost will be
      recognized    over the period during which
      an employee is required to provide service in exchange for
      the award the requisite service period (usually the vesting
      period). No compensation costs are recognized for equity
      instruments for which employees do not render the requisite
      service. The grant-date fair value of employee share options
      and similar instruments will be estimated using
      option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics
      of those instruments (unless observable market prices for the
      same or similar instruments are available). If an equity
      award is modified after the grant date, incremental
      compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to
      the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the
      fair value of the original award immediately before the
      modification.
    </p>
<p>
     Our primary type of share-based compensation consists of stock-based awards. We use the fair value method in accordance with ASC 718. We also may use stock options. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model in valuing options. No stock options were issued during the year ended December 31, 2013.  All outstanding stock options were canceled in 2012.
    </p>
<p align="LEFT" style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight:bold;">
<i>Income taxes</i>
</p>
<p>
   Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, <i>Accounting for Income Taxes</i> ("ASC 740"), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. The Company determines its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, when necessary, to reduce the deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
    </p>
<p>
The determination of the Company's provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.
    </p>
<p>
In accordance with GAAP, The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances.  The Company's management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months
    </p>
<p>Generally, the tax filings are no longer subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for years before 2010.

       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    </p>
<p>
       We had no revenues during
      the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, because
      (1) we did not fly aircraft in passenger, charter, or freight
      service, and (2) we could not sell tickets for those
      services.
    </p>
<p>
     For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, general and administrative expenses were $5,910,517 and $11,125,526, respectively, a decrease of $5,215,009, or 47%. This decrease resulted from the reduction in general and administrative costs incurred in connection with air carrier certification.
    </p>
<p> FAA certification costs increased $192,92 (31%) for the year ended December 31, 2013 from $622,062 reported for the year ended December 31, 2012.  This increase resulted from  the additional costs incurred for FAA certification activities incurred in connection the air certification process.
</p>
<p>
      Primarily as a result of air carrier certification activities, we reported net losses of $6,868,196 and $13,623,873 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $6,755,677, or 50%, which includes a loss of approximately 1.6 million in the sale of a B747 aircraft, replaced by Company's current aircraft purchased in 2010.  This decrease is primarily attributable to  the $5,215,009 decrease in general and administrative expenses, a $126,956 decrease in interest expense, and  a $1,607,183 decrease in loss on the sale of an asset, partially offset by the increase in FAA certification costs of $192,920.
    </p>
<p>
       Our future ability to
      achieve profitability in any given future fiscal period
      remains highly contingent upon our beginning flight
      operations. Our ability to realize revenue from flight
      operations in any given future fiscal period remains highly
      contingent upon our obtaining significant equity infusions
      and/or long-term debt financing sufficient to fund initial
      operations. Even if we were to be successful in procuring
      such funding, there can be no assurance that we will be
      successful in commencing revenue operations or, if commenced,
      that such operations would be profitable.

       Evaluation of Disclosure

      supervision and with the participation of our chief executive
      and  financial officer of our disclosure
      controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
      Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this

      officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
      are effective to ensure that information required to be
      disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under

       Management's Annual Report
      on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management
      is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
      internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
      13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over
      financial reporting is a process designed to provide
      reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
      reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
      external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted
      in the United States.
    </p>
<p>
       Because of its inherent
      limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those
      systems determined to be effective can provide only
      reasonable assurance of achieving their control
      objectives.
    </p>
<p>
       Our management evaluated the
      effectiveness of our internal control over financial
      reporting as of December 31, 2013. &#160;Based on this
      evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31,
      2013, our internal control over financial reporting was
      effective.
    </p>
<p>
       This annual report does not
      include an attestation report of our registered public
      accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
      reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation
      by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to
      temporary rules of the SEC that permit the company to provide
      only management's report in this annual report.
    </p>
<p>
       Changes in Internal Control
      Over Financial Reporting. There was no change in our internal
      controls or in other factors that could affect these controls
      during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
      or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
      control over financial reporting. While existing controls may
      be adequate at present, upon the commencement of flight
      revenue service we intend to implement controls appropriate
      for airline operations.

       C. Nominations for  Director:
    </p>
<p>
       Baltia Air Lines, Inc., has
      had only one recent nomination for director, Vick Luis
      Bolanos, who was nominated and chosen as a director in 2009
      because Baltia sought someone with the skills stated above.
      The Baltia has four Board members. Each has direct access to
      others and "hands on" opportunities to advance the Company.
      Mr. Bolanos was unanimously selected to replace the retiring
      Board member because he brought insight, experience, and
      skills that had enabled him to bring Eastern Construction
      &amp; Electric, Inc. from inception to a large company
      operating in several geographic locations. Similar to the
      operations which Mr. Bolanos has been a part of, Baltia is a
      start-up with plans to become a large company with stations
      in Russia and in several former Soviet controlled
      countries.

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #auto; font-weight: bold;">REPORT OF
      INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM<br/><br/>
<font style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Years Ended December 31, 2013 and
      2012&#160; </font>
</p>
<p>
    Board of Directors and
      Shareholders<br/> Baltia Air Lines, Inc.<br/> New York, NY
    </p>
<p>
I have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Baltia Air Lines, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on my audits.</p>
<p>
I conducted my audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were I engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. my audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.  I believe that my audits provide a reasonable basis for my opinion.</p>
<p>

In my opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p>
<p>

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 9 of the financial statements, the Company has incurred a deficit during its development stage of approximately $95 million and consumed approximately $29 million of cash due to its operating activities. The Company may not have adequate readily available resources to fund operations through December 31, 2014. This raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 9. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty

<p font="" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: bold;">1.       Nature of Operations
    </p>
<p>
The Company was formed as a U.S. airline on August 24, 1989 in the State of New York. Our objective is to provide scheduled air transportation from the U.S. to Russia, the Baltic States and Ukraine.  In 1991, the Department of Transportation (DOT) granted the Company routes to provide nonstop passenger, cargo and mail service from JFK to St. Petersburg and from JFK to Riga, with online service to Minsk, Kiev and Tbilisi as well as back up service to Moscow. We have two registered trademarks, "BALTIA" and "VOYAGER CLASS," and five trademarks subject to registration. Our activities to date have been devoted principally to raising capital, obtaining route authority and approval from the DOT and the FAA, training crews, and conducting market research to develop the Company's marketing strategy.
</p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Regulatory Compliance
</p>
<p>
We intend to operate as a Part 121 carrier, a heavy jet operator.  As such, following certification we will be required to maintain our air carrier standards as prescribed by DOT and FAA regulation and as specified in the FAA approved Company manuals.  As part of its regulatory compliance, we will be required to submit periodic reports of our operations to the DOT.

      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Basis
      of Presentation</p>
<p>   The financial statements have been
      presented in a &#8220;development stage&#8221; format. Since
      inception, our primary activities have been raising of
      capital, obtaining financing and of obtaining route authority
      and approval from the DOT and the FAA. We have not commenced
      our principal revenue producing activities.
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Use  of Estimates</p>
<p>The preparation of financial
      statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
      principles requires our management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and
      liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
      liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the
      reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
      reporting period. Actual results could differ from the
      estimates.

    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Cash
      and Cash Equivalents</p>
<p> For financial statement
      presentation purposes, we consider those short-term, highly
      liquid investments with original maturities of three months
      or less to be cash or cash equivalents. Excepting certain lines of credit
agreements by certain shareholders, there are no cash
      equivalents at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Fair
      Value of Financial Instruments</p>
<p> FASB ASC 825, "<font style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-style: italic;">Financial
      Instruments </font>"
      requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial
      instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not
      recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable
      to estimate fair value. FASB ASC 825 defines fair value of a
      financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument
      could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing
      parties. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying
      value of certain financial instruments (cash and cash
      equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses.)
      approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the
      instruments or interest rates, which are comparable with
      current rates.
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Fair
      Value Measurements</p>
<p> FASB ASC 820 defines fair value
      and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
      establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the
      inputs to the inputs to the valuation techniques. Fair value
      is the price that would be received to sell an asset or
      amount paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
      between market participants at the measurement date. A fair
      value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the
      asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal
      market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a
      principal market, the most advantageous market. Valuation
      techniques that are consistent with the market, income or
      cost approach, as specified by FASB ASC 820, are used to
      measure fair value.
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Fair
      Value Hierarchy</p>
<p>  FASB  ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based
      upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect
      assumptions other market participants would use based upon
      market data obtained from independent sources (observable
      inputs), or reflect the Company's own assumptions of
      market participant valuation (unobservable inputs). In
      accordance with FASB ASC 820, these two types of inputs have
      created the following fair value hierarchy:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
             Level 1 &#8211; Quoted
            prices in active markets that are unadjusted and
            accessible at the measurement date for identical,
            unrestricted assets or liabilities. </li>
<li>
             Level 2 &#8211; Quoted
            prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets
            that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets
            and liabilities in active markets or financial
            instruments for which significant inputs are
            observable, either directly or indirectly. </li>
<li>  Level 3 &#8211; Prices
            or valuations that require inputs that are both
            significant to the fair value measurement and
            unobservable. </li>
</ul>
<p>       &#160;    </p>
<p>
       FASB ASC 820 requires the
      use of observable market data if such data is available
      without undue cost and effort.

          2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">   Measurement of Fair Value</p>
<p>The Company  measures fair value as an exit price using the procedures
      described below for all assets and liabilities measured at
      fair value. When available, the Company uses unadjusted
      quoted market prices to measure fair value and classifies
      such items within Level 1. If quoted market prices are not
      available, fair value is based upon internally developed
      models that use, where possible, current market-based or
      independently-sourced market parameters such as interest
      rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally
      generated models are classified according to the lowest level
      input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
      Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there
      may be inputs that are readily observable. If quoted market
      prices are not available, the valuation model used generally
      depends on the specific asset or liability being valued. The
      determination of fair value considers various factors
      including interest rate yield curves and time value
      underlying the financial instruments.
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Property
      and Equipment</p>
<p>Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
  Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
 useful lives of the respective assets or the lease term.  Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 5-15 years.
Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. Expenditures for minor items, repairs,
and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Gain or loss upon sale or retirement due
to obsolescence is reflected in the operating results in the period the event takes place.
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Valuation of Long-Lived Assets</p>
<p>The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for potential impairment
in accordance with ASC 360,  Property, Plant and Equipment, and records impairment losses
on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets'
carrying amounts.  There was no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Stock-Based
      Compensation Plans</p>
<p>Stock-based awards are accounted
      for using the fair value method in accordance with ASC
      718,  <font style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-style: italic;">Share-Based
      Payments.</font> &#160; Our
      primary type of share-based compensation consists of stock
      options and stock-based awards. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model in
      valuing options. The inputs for the valuation analysis of the
      options include the market value of the Company's
      common stock, the estimated volatility of the Company's
      common stock, the exercise price of the warrants and the risk
      free interest rate.
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Loss
      per Common Share</p>
<p>The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC 262, Earnings Per Share.
Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted loss per
common share incorporates the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents on an average basis during
the period.  All stock options either expired or were canceled during the year ended December 31, 2012.
No adjustment was made to the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in the calculation of
loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.

      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Income
      Taxes</p>
<p>Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740,
<font style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-style: italic;">Accounting for       Income Taxes </font>,
which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability
approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements
or tax returns. The Company determines its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, which
are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, when necessary, to reduce
the deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
    </p>
<p>
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit
of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized.
The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized
is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of
the available facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company
did not have any uncertain tax positions
    </p>
<p>
Generally, tax fillings are no longer subject to income tax examinations by major
taxing authorities for years before 2010.  Any potential examinations may include questioning
the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions
and compliance with U.S. federal, state, and local tax laws.  The Company's management
does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially
change over the next twelve months.
    </p>
<p>
  The Company's policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax
provisions as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company
has not accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
    </p>
<p>
 Upon the attainment of taxable income by the Company, management will assess the
likelihood of realizing the tax benefit associated with the use of the carryforwards
and will recognize a deferred tax asset at that time..
    </p>
<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements
    </p>
<p>
In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11,
   <font style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-style: italic;">Income Taxes </font>
(Topic 740) which provides guidance on financial statement presentation of
an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar
tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exits.  The update is effective for years
beginning after December 15, 2013.  The Company does not expect the implementation
of this standard to have a material impact on its financial position or results
of operations. </p>
<p>
In March 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-05,
<font style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-style: italic;">Foreign Currency Matters
(Topic 830): Parent's Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon
Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity
or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity </font>
(ASU 2013-05). ASU 2013-05 provides guidance on releasing cumulative translation
 adjustments when a reporting entity (parent) ceases to have a controlling
financial interest in a subsidiary or a business within a foreign entity.
ASU 2013-05 is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years and interim
 reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2013-05 is not expected to have
a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. </p>
<p>In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02,
<font style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-style: italic;"> Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulative Other Comprehensive Income </font>
(ASU 2013-02), which replaces the presentation requirements for reclassifications out of
accumulated other comprehensive income in ASU 2011-05 and ASU 2011-12. ASU 2013-02
requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income by component and to present significant
amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by respective
line items of net income if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to
net income in its entirety. The adoption of ASU 2013-02 did not have any impact on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

<p>   On August 18, 2009, the Company purchased a Boeing 747 (N705BL)
with the intent to refurbish it.  Engines were leased on a power-by-the-hour basis,
installed on the aircraft, and it was flown to Malaysia where an FAA certified
maintenance facility was to do the work.  In 2010, Baltia purchased a second
Boeing 747 (N706BL) at a price less than was projected to refurbish N705BL.  On
 May 4, 2012, Baltia removed the engines, sold N705BL at a loss of $1.6 million and
installed the engines on the second aircraft, N706BL, which was purchased at Oscoda,
Michigan, where it remains while Baltia proceeds with its FAA certification.
Recovery of the carrying value of N706BL will occur in the first year of operations, when
it will be used in scheduled flight operations between New York and St. Petersburg, Russia.   </p>

      Taxes
    </p>
<p>
       The Company has approximately $37.7 million in available net operating loss carryovers available to reduce future income taxes. These carryovers expire at various dates through the year 2033. The Company has adopted ASC 740,  <font style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-style: italic;">Accounting for
      Income Taxes</font>   which provides for the recognition of a deferred tax asset based upon the value the loss carry-forwards will have to reduce future income taxes and management's estimate of the probability of the realization of these tax benefits. We have determined it more likely than not that these timing differences will not materialize and have provided a valuation allowance against our entire net deferred tax asset of approximately $7.5 million
    </p>
<p>
       Utilization of federal and state NOL and tax credit carry-forwards may be subject to a
      substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change
      limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
      amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation
      may result in the expiration of NOL and tax credit
      carry-forwards before full utilization.

In connection with the terms of the Note, the Company issued the lender 6.8 million shares of common stock and 3.4 million warrants. The Company recorded the relative fair value of the shares and warrants of $294,297 as additional paid-in capital and established a discount on the debt. The discount was amortized over 24 months at an effective rate of 14.98%.  The note is secured by aircraft to a limit of $2.9 million.
    </p>
<p>
      On March 31, 2013, the repayment terms of the Note were modified, wherein the Company is obligated to repay the principal amount of $1,150,000 to the lender on or before the second anniversary of the date upon which the Company commences its revenue flight operations.  The modification further provides that the Company will pay accrued interest to date on or before the first anniversary of the date upon which the Company commences its revenue flight operations.  There were no other changes to the terms of the original note.

<p font="" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: bold;">9. Development Stage Activities and Going Concern
    </p>
<p>
The Company is currently in the development stage and has not as of yet generated any revenue from its planned operation to provide scheduled air transportation from the United States to Russia, the Baltic States, and the Ukraine.
    </p>
<p>
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
    </p>
<p>
Currently, the Company has a minimum cash balance available for the payment of ongoing operating expenses, which would allow it to cover its operational costs and allow it to continue as a going concern, and it has incurred operating losses and experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception.  The Company has a deficit accumulated as of December 31, 2013 of approximately $95.1 million.  The Company has funded its activities through December 31, 2013 almost exclusively from debt and equity financings.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

    </p>
<p>
For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company raised approximately $4.1 and $3.6 million, respectively, from private placements, funds needed to continue with the certification process, a process that must be completed before it can launch nonstop revenue service to Russia with its 747 aircraft.   In addition to raising funds from private placements, the Company supplemented the financing of its ongoing operations through the issuance of common stock to pay operating expenses not paid with cash raised from the private placements. The continued operations of the Company over the long-term is dependent upon implementing airline service that will generate profits; until such time, however, it will continue to require substantial funds to continue with its aircraft and operational certification and carry out its business plan.  In order to meet its ongoing operating cash requirements, management's plans include financing activities such as private placements of its common stock and the continued issuance of common stock for services rendered by vendors, consultants, and other professionals.  Management has also considered the overall pipeline effect that enhances the initial cash position of a startup carrier. It is the industry practice for passengers to purchase tickets in advance of their flights while service vendors bill the carrier later.  So that a new airline will not fly empty on day one, approximately 30 days prior to the expected inaugural date, the DOT authorizes sales of tickets and cargo. Such funds from advance sales, estimated at approximately $3 million for the company, accumulate in an escrow account, and are released upon the issuance of the air carrier certificate.
    </p>
<p>
In the event we do not generate sufficient funds from revenues or financing through the issuance of our common stock or from debt financing, we may be unable to fully implement our business plan and pay our obligations as they become due, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations
    </p>
<p>
While the Company believes it will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved and that it will succeed in its future operations.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.

<p>
       I, Igor Dmitrowsky, certify
      that:
    </p>
<p>       1. I have reviewed this
      annual report on Form 10-K of Baltia Air Lines, Inc.;
    </p>
<p>       2. Based on my knowledge,
      this report does not contain any untrue statement of a
      material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
      make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
      which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
      to the period covered by this report;
    </p>
<p>       3. Based on my knowledge,
      the financial statements, and other financial information
      included in this report, fairly present in all material
      respects the financial condition, results of operations and
      cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
      presented in this report;
    </p>
<p>       4. The registrant's other
      certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing
      and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
      internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
      Exchange Act Rules 13a- 15(f) and 15d-15(f))for the
      registrant and have:
    </p>
<p>       (a) Designed such disclosure
      controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls
      and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
      ensure that material information relating to the registrant,
      including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
      by others within those entities, particularly during the
      period in which this report is being prepared;
    </p>
<p>       (b) Designed such internal
      control over financial reporting, or caused such internal
      control over financial reporting to be designed under our
      supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
      reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
      financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles;
    </p>
<p>       (c) Evaluated the
      effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
      procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
      the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures,
      as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
      such evaluation; and
    </p>
<p>       (d) Disclosed in this report
      any change in the registrant's internal control over
      financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
      most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal
      quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
      affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
      registrant's internal control over financial reporting;
      and
    </p>
<p>       5. The registrant's other
      certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most
      recent evaluation of internal control over financial
      reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
      committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
      performing the equivalent functions):
    </p>
<p>       (a) All significant
      deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
      operation of internal control over financial reporting which
      are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's
      ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
      information; and
    </p>
<p>       (b) Any fraud, whether or
      not material, that involves management or other employees who
      have a significant role in the registrant's internal control
      over financial reporting.
