ITEM 1. BUSINESS

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

    In accordance with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities
Reform Act of 1995, Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd. ("Great Lakes" or the "Company")
notes that certain statements in this Form 10-K and elsewhere which are
forward-looking and which provide other than historical information, involve
risks and uncertainties that may impact the Company's results of operations.
These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements concerning
the Company's general business strategies, financing decisions, and expectations
for funding expenditures and operations in the future. When used herein, the
words, "believe," "plan," "continue," "hope," "estimate," "project," "intend,"
"expect," and similar expressions reflected in such forward-looking statements
are based on reasonable assumptions, and no statements contained in this
Form 10-K should be relied upon as predictions of future events. Such statements
are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect
or imprecise and may be incapable of being realized. The risks and uncertainties
inherent in these forward-looking statements could cause actual results to
differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements.

    Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statement herein include among
other things: (1) the Company's dependence on its relationship with United
Airlines; (2) potential code-sharing agreements with other airlines; (3) the
effect of general economic conditions on the Company; (4) fuel costs; and
(5) seasonality.

    Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking
statements contained herein, which speak only of the day hereof. The information
contained in this Form 10-K is believed by the Company to be accurate as of the
date hereof. Changes may occur after that date and the Company will not update
that information except as required by law in the normal course of its public
disclosure practices.

GENERAL

    Great Lakes is a regional airline, which during 2000 operated under the
marketing identity United Express. On February 1, 2001, the Company and United
Airlines, Inc. ("United") entered into a new three-year code sharing partnership
which, as more fully described below, changes the identity under which the
Company will operate in the future. As of December 31, 2000, the Company's fleet
consisted of 40 Beechcraft Model 1900D 19-passenger aircraft and eight Embraer
Brasilia Model 120 30-passenger aircraft. The Company also has four Beechcraft
Model 1900C aircraft being used exclusively for freight operations.

UNITED EXPRESS AND CODE SHARING RELATIONSHIP

    At December 31, 2000, the Company served 57 destinations in 14 states
located in the Upper Midwest and West Mountain region, with connections to
United at Chicago O'Hare, Denver, and Minneapolis/St. Paul. The Company has been
operating as a "United Express" carrier since 1992.

    On February 1, 2001, the Company and United entered into a new three-year
code sharing agreement which will become effective May 1, 2001. Under this new
agreement, the Company no longer will operate under the name "United Express";
rather, it will operate under its own name and be displayed in reservations
systems under its own code when it is not flying a segment as part of a code
sharing flight. The agreement provides for use of United's flight designator for
Great Lakes flights connecting with United flights in Denver and Chicago, and
permits the Company to enter into code sharing agreements with certain other
carriers. The Company will continue to participate in United's Mileage Plus
frequent flyer

                                       1
<PAGE>
program. The agreement also requires United to provide financial support to
Great Lakes to cover a portion of the Company's cost of returning to marketing
itself under its own identity.

    The Company is in code sharing negotiations with another carrier which, if
successful, would substantially increase the availability of long-haul
connections under a single carrier service identity for its customers at the
Company's Denver Hub.

MARKETS

    Great Lakes provides direct and connecting service to and from three major
cities. At December 31, 2000, the Company operated 105 departures daily from
Denver, 47 departures daily from Chicago O'Hare, and seven departures daily from
Minneapolis/St. Paul.

ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE PROGRAM

    The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 ("The Deregulation Act") allowed
airlines great freedom to introduce, increase and generally reduce or eliminate
service to existing markets. Under the Essential Air Service Program, which is
administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT), certain communities that
received scheduled air service prior to the passage of the Deregulation Act are
guaranteed specified levels of "essential air service." The DOT may authorize
federal subsidies to compensate a carrier providing essential air service in
otherwise unprofitable or minimally profitable markets. If these subsidies are
eliminated the Company may discontinue service to some or all of the subsidized
communities.

    At December 31, 2000, the Company served 27 essential air service
communities on a subsidized basis. The Company received $14.9 million,
$16.2 million, and $15.0 million in essential air service subsidies for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. An airline serving
a community that qualifies for essential air services is required to give the
DOT advance notice before it may terminate, suspend or reduce service. Depending
on the circumstances, the DOT may require the continuation of existing service
until a replacement carrier is found. EAS rates are normally set for two-year
periods. Significant fluctuations of fuel and other costs can affect the
profitability of EAS services during the two-year term.

AIRCRAFT

    At December 31, 2000, the Company's fleet consisted of 44 Beechcraft 1900
aircraft and eight Embraer passenger aircraft, of which 40 Beechcraft 1900D
aircraft and eight Embraer Brasilia aircraft were operated in scheduled
passenger service. The remaining four Beechcraft 1900 aircraft are being
utilized exclusively for scheduled mail and freight operations. The Beechcraft
1900 aircraft are pressurized, radar equipped and offer a 300-mile per hour
cruising speed for 19 passengers, plus cargo, with a range of 850 miles. The
Beechcraft 1900 aircraft is widely regarded by airlines as an efficient and
reliable aircraft for regional service. As of December 31, 2000, the Company
owned 28 of its Beechcraft 1900 aircraft and leased the remaining 16 under
agreements with remaining terms ranging from nine to thirteen years.

    The 30 passenger Embraer Brasilia aircraft are equipped with advanced
avionics, have restrooms, are staffed with a flight attendant and offer a
330-mile per hour cruising speed with a range of 750 miles. As of December 31,
2000, the Company owned four of its Embraer Brasilia aircraft and leased the
remaining four under agreements with remaining terms ranging from two to eleven
years.

</TABLE>

    As of December 31, 2000, the average ages of the Company's owned and leased
aircraft were 6.3 and 5.2 years, respectively. As of December 31, 1999, the
average ages of the Company's owned and leased aircraft were 5.3 and 4.2 years,
respectively.

AIRCRAFT DEBT AND LEASES

    Raytheon Aircraft Corporation together with its financing affiliate
(collectively, "Raytheon") is the Company's primary aircraft supplier and
largest creditor. The Company has financed all but one of its Beechcraft 1900
aircraft and one of its Brasilia aircraft under lease and debt agreements with
Raytheon. Raytheon had also provided a $5 million working capital line of credit
and a $5 million short-term loan, both of which were collateralized by all
Beechcraft spare parts and equipment and accounts receivable. The short-term
loan was paid on January 7, 2000 from the proceeds of a line of credit entered
into with Coast Business Credit and on December 1, 2000, the Company converted
the remaining balance on the working capital line to a three-year term loan
which is also collateralized by all Beechcraft spare parts and equipment and
accounts receivable. In addition, as part of a short-term financing in 1997,
Raytheon was granted a ten year warrant to purchase one million shares of the
Company's common stock at a price of $.75 per share. On October 5, 2000, the
Company exercised the call option and retired the warrant after tendering
payment of $281,750 to Raytheon.

    The Company has financed seven of its Brasilia aircraft through lease and
debt agreements with other unrelated entities (collectively, the "Brasilia
Agreements").

MAINTENANCE

    The FAA mandates periodic inspection and maintenance of commercial aircraft.
The Company performs most maintenance and inspection of its aircraft and engines
(except engine overhaul) using its own personnel. Heavy maintenance bases are
located at Cheyenne, Wyoming; Huron, South Dakota; Grand Island, Nebraska and
Spencer, Iowa. The Spencer location will be consolidated with the Cheyenne
facility on May 30, 2001. Line maintenance is also performed in Denver, Colorado
and at Chicago, O'Hare. The Company attempts to perform its maintenance at
locations where its aircraft are stored overnight to reduce maintenance costs
and promote a higher level of operating efficiency. Parts and supplies
inventories are also maintained at these locations to promote the mechanical
dispatch reliability of the fleet. The Company also maintains an inventory of
spare engines and propellers for its fleet to allow for minimal downtime during
major overhauls. The Company internally performs overhauls of selected aircraft
components for its fleet.

SLOT ALLOCATION

    Under slot rules currently in effect at Chicago O'Hare, scheduled flights
operate between 6:45 A.M. and 9:14 P.M. only if an airline has obtained a slot
or slot exemption. As of December 31, 2000, the

                                       3
<PAGE>
Company was utilizing 56 slots and slot exemptions allocated to it by DOT/FAA.
In March 2000, Congress passed legislation that will phase out slot rules at
Chicago O'Hare by July 1, 2002. At that time, the Company will be able to
schedule its arrivals and departures without regulatory restrictions.

YIELD MANAGEMENT

    The Company closely monitors its inventory and pricing of available seats
with a computerized yield management system. This system enables the Company's
revenue control analysts to examine the Company's past traffic and pricing
trends and to estimate the optimal allocation of seats by fare class (the number
of seats made available for sale at various fares). The analysts then monitor
each flight to adjust seat allocations and booking levels, with the objective of
maximizing the total revenue for each flight.

MARKETING

    The Company's services are marketed primarily by means of listings in
computerized reservation systems and the OFFICIAL AIRLINE GUIDE, and through
direct contact with travel agencies and corporate travel departments. The
Company's promotional programs emphasize the Company's close affiliation with
its code sharing partner(s) and the right of the Company's passengers to
participate in United's "Mileage Plus" frequent flyer program.

COMPETITION

    The Company competes primarily with regional and major air carriers and
automobile transportation. The Company's competition from other air carriers
varies from location to location and, in certain areas, comes from regional and
major carriers who serve the same destinations as the Company but through
different hub and spoke systems. The domestic airline industry has undergone
major structural changes since the enactment of the Deregulation Act.
Deregulation has made possible the rapid entry of competitors into the Company's
markets, and competitors are able to adjust fares rapidly to improve their
competitive position.

    Almost all markets are subject to a high degree of price competition both
from established carriers and low fare jet carriers. The Company believes,
however, that its ability to compete in its market areas is strengthened by its
code sharing relationship with United and United's substantial presence at
Denver and Chicago O'Hare which enhance the importance of the United "UA*"
flight designator code to Great Lakes in its service area. The Company competes
with other airlines by offering frequent flights, flexible schedules and low
fares. In addition, the Company's competitive position benefits from the large
number of participants in United's "Mileage Plus" frequent flyer program who fly
regularly to or from the markets served by the Company.

    There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience increased
competition from existing competitors or from new entrants on one or more of the
Company's routes.

FUEL

    The Company has not experienced difficulty with fuel availability and
expects to continue to be able to obtain fuel in quantities sufficient to meet
its future requirements. The Company contracts directly with refiners for the
purchase of portions of its fuel. Standard industry contracts generally do not
provide protection against fuel price increases and do not ensure availability
of supply. Accordingly, a significant increase in the cost of fuel, if not
accompanied by an equivalent increase in passenger revenues, would have a
material impact on the Company's future operating results. During 2000 the
Company's average price of fuel increased from $0.93 per gallon to $1.26 per
gallon resulting in $4.9 million of increased costs to the Company for the year.

</TABLE>

    The Company's pilots are represented by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. The agreement with the pilots became amendable October 30, 2000, and
negotiations are continuing. The Company's flight attendants are also
represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the agreement
with the flight attendants becomes amendable April 1, 2002.

    The Company's mechanics and maintenance clerks are represented by the
International Association of Machinists ("IAM"). The mechanics agreement becomes
amendable November 1, 2005, and the maintenance clerks agreement becomes
amendable March 1, 2002.

    The Company believes that relations with its employees are satisfactory.

CHARTER AND FREIGHT SERVICE

    The Company uses available aircraft and from time to time leases four and
six passenger aircraft from an affiliated company to provide charter services to
private individuals, corporations and groups such as athletic teams. The Company
also carries freight, mail and small packages on most of its scheduled flights.
Revenues from its charter flights and freight deliveries were 3.8 percent,
4.4 percent and 3.3 percent of the Company's total revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

REGULATION

    In accordance with the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
amended (the "1958 Act"), the Company is an air carrier subject to regulation by
the DOT, primarily with respect to economic matters, and is also subject to
regulation by the FAA with respect to certain safety related matters.

    The 1958 Act eliminated many regulatory constraints so that airlines became
free to set fares and, with limited exceptions, to establish domestic routes
without the necessity of seeking government approval. The DOT is still
authorized to establish consumer protection regulations; to prohibit certain
pricing practices; to mandate conditions of carriage; and to make ongoing
determinations of a carrier's fitness, willingness and ability to properly and
lawfully provide air transportation. The DOT also has the power to bring
proceedings for the enforcement of its regulations under the 1958 Act, including
the assessment of civil penalties and the revocation of operating authority, and
to seek criminal sanctions.

    The Company holds an air carrier-operating certificate issued by the FAA
pursuant to Part 121 of its regulations. The Company, as a commuter air carrier,
is licensed under Part 298 of the Economic Regulations of the DOT. The Company
is subject to the jurisdiction of the FAA with respect to its aircraft
maintenance and operations, including equipment, ground facilities, dispatch,
communications, training, weather observation, flight personnel and other
matters affecting air safety. To ensure compliance with its regulations, the FAA
requires airlines to obtain an operating certificate and operations
specifications for the particular aircraft and types of operations conducted by
the carrier, all of which are subject to suspension or revocation for cause.

                                       5
<PAGE>
    The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications
Commission regarding the use of its radio facilities. Local governments and
authorities in certain markets have adopted regulations governing various
aspects of aircraft operations, including noise abatement and curfews and use of
airport facilities. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all such
regulations.

INSURANCE

    The Company carries the types and amounts of insurance required by the DOT
and customary in the regional airline industry, including coverage for public
liability, property damage, aircraft loss or damage, baggage and cargo liability
and workers' compensation. The Company believes that the insurance is adequate
as to amounts and risks covered. There can be no assurance, however, that the
limits of the Company's insurance will be sufficient to cover any catastrophic
loss.

    The Company leases gate and ramp facilities at 54 airports where ticketing,
passenger loading, and unloading are handled by Company personnel. Payments to
airport authorities for ground facilities are based on a number of factors,
including the amount of space used and flight volume. The Company also leases
aircraft hangar space for maintenance operations at four of the locations it
serves.

    The Company leases approximately 15,000 square feet of space in Spencer,
Iowa which was previously used for administrative, flight operations and
maintenance offices, in addition to approximately 35,000 square feet of aircraft
maintenance and hangar space located adjacent thereto. The Company leases an
additional 32,000 square feet of space in Spencer for its certified repair
station. Both of these leases expire within the next 18 months and the Company
will not renew these leases. Effective January 1, 2000, the Company entered into
a lease in Cheyenne, Wyoming, for approximately 42,000 square feet of space for
administration and maintenance needs. In 1999, construction began on an
additional leased facility in Cheyenne that the Company occupied in 2000. The
facility is approximately 54,000 square feet and is used for administrative,
flight operations, and maintenance offices, maintenance and hangar space. The
Company believes that it has adequate facilities for the conduct of its current
and planned operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit arising from the collision of a
small aircraft with one of the Company's Beechcraft 1900 aircraft in Quincy,
Illinois on November 19, 1996. The collision occurred at the intersection of two
runways as the Company's aircraft was landing, and resulted in the death of all
ten passengers and the two crewmembers. The Company's insurance carrier is
providing for the Company's defense in the lawsuit and the Company believes that
all claims arising from the accident will be adequately covered by insurance.

    The Company is a party to several routine pending legal proceedings, none of
which management believes are material to the Company.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

    There were no matters submitted to a vote of the Company's shareholders
during the three-month period ended December 31, 2000.

COMPARISON OF 2000 TO 1999

    PASSENGER REVENUES:  Passenger revenues increased 5.0% from 1999 as a result
of a similar increase in yield per revenue passenger mile. This increase was
produced by fare increases instituted to recover the higher cost of fuel.
However, passenger traffic and revenue passenger miles remained flat between the
two years as a result of a shift in flying from longer stage length markets such
as Denver to Bismark, North Dakota and Sioux Falls, South Dakota to shorter
stage length markets such as Denver to Santa Fe, New Mexico and Gillette,
Wyoming and during the third quarter, disruptions and cancellations of United
connecting flights. Further, yield increases in 2000 were reduced from what they
otherwise would have been as a result of discount fares in the third and fourth
quarters instituted by United to regain market share lost during their schedule
disruptions.

    PUBLIC SERVICE REVENUES:  Reduced public service revenues resulted from
discontinuance of subsidized service to Fairmont, Minnesota, Goodland and Great
Bend, Kansas, and Lamar, Colorado.

    OTHER REVENUES:  The decline in other revenues resulted from the
discontinuation of ground handling of certain other airlines.

    OPERATING EXPENSES:  Total operating expenses increased $10.0 million, or
8.1% to $132.7 million, or 25.2 cents per ASM, in 2000 from $122.7 million, or
23.3 cents per ASM in 1999. The largest factor in the increase is increasing
fuel costs of $4.9 million in 2000, as described below.

    Salaries, wages, and benefits expense increased to $35.1 million to 6.7
cents per ASM during 2000, from 6.3 cents per ASM during 1999, primarily as a
result of higher labor rates under the union agreements with the Company's
mechanics and flight crews.

    Aircraft fuel expense increased $4.9 million in 2000, due to an increase in
the average price per gallon to $1.26 per gallon in 2000 from $.93 per gallon in
1999 or an increase of 35.5% per gallon. During the first three months of 2001,
fuel prices have decreased slightly. The Company is unable to predict future
price levels.

    Commissions decreased $1.5 million, or 26.7% in 2000 due to a reduction in
the level of tickets purchased through travel agencies and a decrease in
commission rates.

    Depreciation and amortization increased $2.3 million, or 48.6% in 2000 and
aircraft rentals decreased $4.0 million, or 30.1% in 2000 primarily as a result
of the purchase in July 1999 of 22 aircraft that had previously been financed as
operating leases.

    Other rentals and landing fee expenses increased $1.3 million, or 20.0% to
1.5 cents per ASM during 2000, from 1.2 cents per ASM in 1999 primarily as a
result of increased activity at the Denver Hub.

    Other operating expenses increased $4.8 million, or 19.0% to 5.7 cents per
ASM in 2000 from 4.8 cents in 1999, reflecting higher general and
administrative, marketing and communications costs.

    Interest expense increased $3.2 million in 2000, primarily as a result of
the purchase in July 1999 of 22 additional aircraft that had previously been
financed as operating leases.

    INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT):  No income tax benefit was recorded for 2000
due to the fact that the Company is in a loss carry forward position and that
the realization of any benefits of such are substantially in doubt. The Company
incurred $6 thousand of state income tax expense in 2000.

COMPARISON OF 1999 TO 1998

    OPERATING REVENUES:  Operating revenues increased 15.2% to $131.4 million in
1999 from $114.0 million during 1998. The increase in operating revenues
resulted from the increase in revenue passenger miles flown by 6.3% to
265.7 million in 1999 from 250.1 million during 1998 and a 7.2% increase in
average yield per passenger mile to 40.1 cents in 1998 from 37.4 cents in 1998.
Capacity increased to 526.1 million ASMs in 1999 from 489.2 million ASMs during
1998. The additional capacity is a result of a full year's worth of service from
the expansion of service in the Denver markets. In addition, public service
revenue increased 8.0% to $16.2 million in 1999 from $15.0 million in 1998.

                                       11
<PAGE>
    OPERATING EXPENSES:  Total operating expenses increased 14.1% to
$122.7 million, or 23.3 cents per ASM, in 1999 from $107.5 million, or 22.0
cents per ASM in 1998. The increase is due to increasing fuel costs in 1999, as
well as higher maintenance materials and component repairs expense.

    Salaries, wages, and benefits expense increased to 6.3 cents per ASM during
1999, from 5.9 cents per ASM during 1998, primarily as a result of higher labor
rates under the union agreements with the Company's mechanics and flight crews
and the higher number of employees needed to support the increased level of
operations.

    Aircraft fuel expense per ASM increased to 3.2 cents in 1999 from 2.9 cents
in 1998 due to increasing fuel prices during 1999.

    Aircraft maintenance and repairs expense increased to 3.3 cents per ASM
during 1999, from 1.9 cents per ASM in 1998. Maintenance materials expense in
1998 was favorably impacted by the use of certain inventoried parts, which had
been partially reserved in prior years.

    Aircraft expense (depreciation and amortization, aircraft rental, and
interest) decreased to 4.5 cents per ASM during 1999, from 4.8 cents per ASM in
1998 as a result of a larger base of ASMs over which to spread the fixed cost of
the aircraft.

    Other rentals and landing fee expenses decreased to 1.2 cents per ASM during
1999, from 1.3 cents per ASM in 1998.

    Other operating expenses increased to 4.8 cents per ASM in 1999 from 4.7
cents in 1998, reflecting higher general and administrative, marketing and
communications costs.

    Interest expense increased to $6.0 million in 1999 from $3.5 million in
1998, primarily as a result of the purchase in July 1999 of 22 additional
aircraft that had previously been financed as operating leases.

    INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT):  No income tax benefit was recorded for 1999
due to the fact that the Company was in a loss carry forward position and that
the realization of any benefits of such are substantially in doubt. The
provision for income taxes in 1998 represents state income taxes estimated to be
payable.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    On January 7, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Coast
Business Credit to provide the Company with a $20 million revolving credit
facility, collateralized by accounts receivable. The maximum borrowings
available to the Company is based upon the amount of receivables available to
collateralize the amount being borrowed. At closing, $5 million of proceeds was
used to pay a short-term note due to Raytheon. At December 31, 2000, the amount
available under the line of credit agreement was $13,161,347, all of which had
been borrowed.

    Raytheon is the Company's primary aircraft supplier and largest creditor.
The Company has financed all but one of its Beechcraft 1900 aircraft and one of
its Brasilia aircraft under related lease and debt agreements with Raytheon.
Raytheon had also provided a $5 million working capital line of credit (payable
on demand and expiring on June 30, 1999) and a $5 million short-term loan, due
on June 30, 1999, and collateralized by Beechcraft spare parts and equipment and
accounts receivable. The Company paid Raytheon $5 million on January 7, 2000
upon closing of the agreement with Coast Business Credit (Coast). Additionally,
the Company converted the remainder of the Raytheon working capital line of
credit to a three-year term note on December 1, 2000.

    The agreement with Coast contains a covenant which requires the Company to
maintain a specific balance of tangible net worth, (as defined). At
December 31, 2000, the Company was not in compliance with that covenant. Under
the Coast agreement, such noncompliance permits Coast, at its option, to

                                       12
<PAGE>
require immediate prepayment of all amounts owed by Great Lakes to Coast
($13.2 million at December 31, 2000). Such action would further exacerbate the
corporate liquidity issues described below. Coast has not, to date, taken any
action as a result of the default although the interest rate on the Coast loan
now has been increased by 3% annually as a result of not meeting a lesser net
tangible assets requirement. This default could result in default on other
agreements or contracts. Such default and recent losses could also have an
adverse effect on the Company's relationship with current and potential code
sharing partners.

    The Company incurred a substantial loss during the fourth quarter which was
partially caused by major fare reductions by United which in turn affected the
fares received by the Company, in addition to winter weather related expenses
and flight cancellations. The Company believes that its new code sharing
agreement will provide more flexibility to set fares and potentially increase
revenues. Because of the recent nature of these losses, the Company currently
has no financing agreements in place under which it can secure additional funds.
The Company is currently exploring alternatives to meet its future liquidity
requirements and is making payment to significant creditors as current cash flow
allows. The Company is in current contact with certain of these creditors
regarding its slowness in payments. To date, no formal action has been taken by
the Company's creditors. However, no assurance can be given that the Company's
creditors may not take such action. Historically, the operations have been
highly seasonal with the second and third quarters of the calendar year
producing significantly more cash flow than the first and fourth quarters.

    The Company believes the fair value of a number of its aircraft is higher
than the current amount of financing on such aircraft.

    As a result, during the first two months of 2001 passenger revenues declined
by approximately 10.4 percent as compared to the first two months of 2000. This
was partially the result of a discontinuation of unprofitable service at
Rhinelander, Wisconsin on January 5 and Burlington, Iowa; Lafayatte, Indiana,
and Mattoon, Illinois on February 15. In February of 2001, the Company cancelled
20.5% of its scheduled operations primarily due to severe winter weather in the
upper Midwest and five days of lower than required landing visibility due to fog
conditions at its Denver hub. The Company estimates that these disruptions
resulted in passenger revenue losses in excess of $1.5 million. As a result, the
Company expects to incur a significant loss in the first quarter of 2001. In
February and March of 2001, the Company did not make scheduled debt and lease
payments to Raytheon of approximately $2 million. In addition, the Company did
not make scheduled lease payments of $226,000 to two lessors on four aircraft.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and all hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities at their fair values. Accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on its designation and
effectiveness. For derivatives that qualify as effective hedges, the change in
fair value will have no impact on earnings until the hedged item affects
earnings. For derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, or for
the ineffective portion of a hedging instrument, the change in fair value will
affect current period earnings. At December 31, 2000, the Company had no
derivative instruments. The Company adopted this statement on January 1, 2001.
There has been no impact as a result of the adoption.

    In 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
The SAB summarizes the SEC staff's views on applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The
company has reviewed its revenue recognition policies and has determined that
they comply with the principles as set forth in SAB No. 101. Accordingly, the
adoption of the SAB will have no effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM

    The Company's passengers carried as a part of a code-sharing flight with
United, and effective May 1, 2001, carried under the Company's own name may earn
miles in United's "Mileage Plus" frequent flyer program. Passengers may use
mileage accumulated in this program to obtain discounted or free tickets for
trips that might include a flight segment on one of the Company's flights. No
revenues are earned or collected on free tickets awarded to passengers under the
program. Awards earned under the frequent flyers program have an expiration date
three years from the date earned however, the three year period is renewed each
time the participant earns or redeems mileage. The program also contains certain
restrictions, including blackout dates and capacity controlled bookings, which
substantially limit the use of awards on certain flights and during the busiest
periods. The Company continually monitors the number of free travel award
reservations on its flight segments to ensure that they are within the capacity
restrictions defined in the "Mileage Plus" program. The Company's yield
management program and related seat restrictions minimize the number of revenue
passengers that may be displaced on any individual flight segment. To date, the
Company has not experienced any material use of "Mileage Plus" awards to obtain
travel on flights, and the incremental cost to the Company attributable to the
exercise of frequent flyer awards (consisting primarily of a minimal amount of
additional gate and passenger service expenses) has not been material. Awards
used on the Company's flights during the year ended December 31, 2000
represented approximately 2.3% percent of the Company's total passengers. The
Company expects that this percentage will remain approximately the same for the
foreseeable future. Based on this low percentage, the availability on many of
the Company's flights of otherwise vacant seats, and on the program's
restrictions, the Company believes that the displacement, if any, of revenue
passengers by users of "Mileage Plus" and awards will not become material. The
Company continually monitors the number of awards redeemed and will accrue the
incremental costs associated with the "Mileage Plus" and program if they become
material.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

    Except for the price of fuel, inflation has not had a material effect on the
Company's operations in the past five years. The Company is subject to
inflationary pressures from labor agreements, fuel price escalations and costs
at airports served which it attempts to recover through fare and schedule
adjustments.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE
  PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1996

CAUTIONARY FACTORS

    The Company wishes to caution shareholders and prospective investors that
the following important factors, among others identified in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K, could affect the Company's actual operating results, and that such
results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements made by the Company. The statements under this caption are intended
to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1996. The following information is not intended to
limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under
other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose. The order in which
such factors appear below should not be construed to indicate their relative
importance or priority.

DEPENDENCE ON RELATIONSHIP WITH UNITED

    The Company generated 100% of its passenger revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2000 under the United Express Agreements described under
"Business--United Express and Code Sharing Relationship". As a result of the
relationship with United, the Company's business is sensitive to events and
risks

                                       14
<PAGE>
affecting United. If adverse events affect United's business as was the case in
the last two quarters of 2000, the Company's business is also adversely
affected.

    The impact of this relationship is shown below in the graph "180-Day
Advanced Bookings" which displays total passenger reservations for future
flights by week. The summer 2000 United labor disruptions and schedule
reductions resulted in a significant reduction in passenger reservations on
Great Lakes during this high travel period. Major temporary fare reductions by
United to regain market share diluted fourth quarter yields. Also displayed is
the slowing of reservation sales at the end of 2000 and early 2001 as capacity
is reduced to match anticipated traffic levels.

    On February 1, 2001, the Company and United entered into a new three-year
code sharing agreement which becomes effective May 1, 2001. Under the new
agreement, Great Lakes, operating under its own name may enter into code sharing
agreements with certain other carriers. To the extent that the Company is
successful in participating in code sharing agreements with other carriers, it
will reduce its dependence on United and may mitigate the effects of such
adverse events if they relate to United only.

EFFECT OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

    The airline industry is significantly affected by general economic
conditions. During recent recessions, most airlines reduced fares in an effort
to increase traffic. Economic and competitive conditions in the airline industry
have contributed to a number of bankruptcies and liquidations among airlines. A
worsening of current economic conditions, or an extended period of recession
nationally or regionally, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
operations.

FUEL COSTS

    Fuel is a major component of operating expense for all airlines. The
Company's cost of fuel varies directly with market conditions, and the Company
has no guaranteed long-term sources of supply. The

                                       15
<PAGE>
Company intends generally to follow industry trends by raising fares in response
to significant fuel price increases. However, the Company's ability to pass on
increased fuel costs through fare increases may be limited by economic and
competitive conditions. Accordingly, a reduction in the availability or an
increase in the price of fuel could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's cash flow from operations and profitability.

SEASONALITY

    Historically, the Company has experienced lower passenger volumes during the
months of January through April and in November and December. This seasonality
can be attributed primarily to relatively difficult winter weather operating
conditions in the Company's principal area of operations, resulting in fewer
vacations and other discretionary trips and reduced business travel during these
months. These seasonal factors have generally resulted in reduced revenues,
increased operating losses and reduced cash flow for the Company during these
months.

CONTROL BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER

    Mr. Douglas G. Voss beneficially owns or controls approximately 62% of the
outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. On October 22, 1996, Mr. Voss
transferred approximately one-half of the shares of the Company's common stock
owned by him to his ex-spouse, Ms. Gayle R. Brandt, pursuant to the Marital
Dissolution Stipulation and Property Settlement. Ms. Brandt has granted
Mr. Voss an Irrevocable Proxy to vote such securities until June 28, 2010.
Accordingly, Mr. Voss will continue to be in a position to control the
management and affairs of the Company.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    The risk inherent in the Company's market risk sensitive instruments and
positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors.
The Company is susceptible to certain risks related to changes in the cost of
aircraft fuel and changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2000, the Company
does not have any derivative financial instruments.

AIRCRAFT FUEL

    Airline operators are dependent upon fuel to operate and therefore, are
impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices. Great Lakes' earnings are affected
by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Aircraft fuel
represented approximately 16.2% of Great Lakes' operating expenses in 2000. A
one-cent change in the average cost of aircraft fuel would impact the Company's
aircraft fuel expense by approximately $180,000 annually, based upon fuel
consumption in 2000.

INTEREST RATES

    The Company's operations are very capital intensive, as the vast majority of
assets are flight equipment, which are long lived. Great Lakes' exposure to
market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to its debt
obligations. The Company does have exposure to changes in cash flows resulting
from changes in interest rates as a significant portion of its long-term debt
has variable interest rates. Additionally, the Company is exposed to changes in
fair values of its debt obligations which carry fixed rates of interest. As
disclosed in Note 5 to the Financial Statements, the Company has total long-term
debt outstanding of $105.5 million at December 31, 2000.

                                       16

    Assuming no change in variable rates at December 31, 2000 the interest
expense on long term obligations due in the five subsequent years and thereafter
were as follows:

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors
Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd.:

    We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Great Lakes
Aviation, Ltd. (an Iowa Corporation) as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000. In connection
with our audits of the financial statements we have also audited the financial
statement schedule. These financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd.
as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

    The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 2 to the
financial statements, the Company has suffered significant losses in the year
ended December 31, 2000, and has liabilities in excess of current assets at
December 31, 2000. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these
matters are also described in note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                           DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS

    BUSINESS

The Company operates as United Express under a cooperative marketing agreement
    (United Express Agreement) with United Airlines, Inc. (United) and provides
    service to 57 destinations in the Upper Midwest and Mountain West Region as
    of December 31, 2000.

The United Express Agreement expired on December 31, 1997. In 2000, 1999 and
    1998, the Company and United operated as if the principal day-to-day
    operational provisions of the previous code sharing agreement were still
    effective. On February 1, 2001, the Company and United entered into a new
    three-year code sharing agreement which will become effective May 1, 2001.
    Under this new agreement, the Company no longer will operate under the name
    "United Express"; rather, it will operate under its own name and be
    displayed in reservations systems under its own code when it is not flying a
    segment as part of a code sharing flight. The agreement provides for use of
    United's flight designator for Great Lakes flights connecting with United
    flights in Denver and Chicago and permits the Company to enter into code
    sharing agreements with certain other carriers. The Company will continue to
    participate in United's Mileage Plus frequent flyer program. In conjunction
    with the new code sharing agreement, the Company entered into a transition
    agreement with United whereby the Company is to develop and implement its
    own reservation system by no later than January 31, 2002. The transition
    agreement also requires United to provide financial support to Great Lakes
    to cover a substantial portion of the Company's cost of returning to
    marketing itself under its own identity, such as the painting of its
    aircraft, development of the Company's own label and new uniforms for
    employees.

Passenger revenues during 2000, 1999, and 1998, were derived 100 percent,
    100 percent and 99 percent from United Express operations. Approximately
    75 percent, 68 percent, and 49 percent of the United Express passengers
    connected with United for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
    respectively.

    USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    UNION AGREEMENTS

The Company's pilots are represented by the International Brotherhood of
    Teamsters. The agreement with the pilots became amendable October 30, 2000,
    and negotiations are continuing. The Company's flight attendants are also
    represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the agreement
    with the flight attendants becomes amendable April 1, 2002.

    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Substantially all accounts receivable balances are due from various airlines,
    with approximately 60 percent of the December 31, 2000 and December 31,
    1999, balances, respectively due from United. All receivables are pledged as
    collateral securing a $20,000,000 line of credit.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

                           DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
    INVENTORIES

Inventories consist of flight equipment spare parts and fuel and are stated at
    the lower of average cost or market. An allowance for depreciation is
    provided at rates which depreciate the cost of flight equipment spare parts,
    less estimated residual value, over the estimated useful lives of the
    related aircraft. The accumulated allowances were $9,540,952 and $8,733,827,
    respectively, at December 31, 2000 and 1999. Expendable parts are charged to
    maintenance expense as used. Inventories consisting of Beech aircraft spare
    parts and equipment are pledged as collateral securing a $20,000,000 line of
    credit and a Raytheon term note.

    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line
    basis for financial reporting purposes over estimated useful lives of
    14-20 years for flight equipment and 3-10 years for other property and
    equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life
    of the lease or the life of the asset. Accelerated methods of depreciation
    are used for tax reporting purposes. All owned aircraft are pledged to
    collateralize outstanding obligations.

Maintenance and repairs, including periodic aircraft overhauls, are expensed as
    incurred.

    OTHER ASSETS

Approximately $1,475,000 of long-term deposits on aircraft operating leases at
    December 31, 2000 and 1999, were included in other assets.

    DEFERRED PAYMENTS

During 1997, the Company failed to make scheduled payments on several leases and
    subsequently renegotiated substantially all of its lease agreements. The
    renegotiated leases contain higher monthly payments and longer payment terms
    than the original agreements. The unpaid rentals have been accrued and
    expensed in the period to which they related and are being paid over the new
    lease terms of the aircraft.

During February and March of 2001, the Company did not make scheduled debt and
    lease payments to Raytheon of approximately $2 million. In addition, the
    Company did not make scheduled lease payments of $225,000 to two lessors on
    four aircraft. The Company intends to restructure the payments to a later
    time.

    DEFERRED CREDITS

The Company has received various incentives in the form of interest rate
    subsidies and spares parts in connection with the acquisition of new
    aircraft. Incentives are being amortized as a reduction of rent expense or
    interest expense over the term of the related agreement.

    REVENUE RECOGNITION

Passenger revenues are recorded as income when the respective services are
    rendered. Liability for unused tickets issued by the Company is recorded as
    unearned revenue. The Company also receives public

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

                           DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
    service subsidy revenues for serving certain communities that do not
    generate sufficient traffic to fully support profitable air service, which
    are recorded as income as the agreed upon air service is furnished by the
    Company.

    FREQUENT FLYER AWARDS

The Company operates under a code-sharing agreement with United, and
    participates in its frequent flyer program. The Company has not deferred any
    revenue or accrued for incremental costs for mileage accumulation relating
    to these programs, as the impact has not been material.

    INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
    tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
    attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
    of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
    operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
    taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
    expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on
    deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period
    that includes the enactment date.

    INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic income (loss) per share have been computed by dividing net income (loss)
    by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock during outstanding
    each of the years presented. Diluted income (loss) per share have been
    calculated by also including in the computation the impact of the issuance
    of common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding warrants and the
    effect of those employee stock options granted to employees as potential
    common stock that would be dilutive. Since the Company had suffered a net
    loss in the year ended December 31, 2000, the effects of potential common
    stock issuance's were not included in the calculation, as their effects
    would be anti-dilutive.

    STOCK OPTION PLANS

The Company has elected the pro forma disclosure option of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation". The Company will continue applying the accounting treatment
    prescribed by the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees", and related interpretations. Pro forma net income
    (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share have been provided as if
    SFAS No. 123 were adopted for all stock-based compensation plans.

    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth below:

Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities:

    The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term nature
       of these instruments.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

                           DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
Long-term debt:

    Based upon the Company's concentration of long-term debt with the
       manufacturer of aircraft, the fair value of long-term debt was not
       reasonably determinable.

(2) LIQUIDITY AND GOING-CONCERN MATTERS

The Company has suffered significant losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2000, the year ended December 31, 2000, and the first two months of fiscal
    2001 and has current liabilities in excess of current assets at
    December 31, 2000. As a result of these losses, the Company is currently not
    in compliance with its line of credit financial covenants. The Company's
    ability to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to utilize
    its line of credit to pay its obligations as they come due, upon maintaining
    adequate liquidity, and achieving sustained profitability. The accompanying
    financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which
    assumes continuity of operations and realization of assets and liabilities
    in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include
    any adjustments that might result if the Company was forced to discontinue
    its operations.

Because of the recent nature of these losses, the Company currently has no
    financing agreements in place under which it can secure additional funds.
    The Company is currently exploring alternatives to meet its future liquidity
    requirements and is making payment to significant creditors as current cash
    flow allows. The Company is in current contact with certain of these
    creditors regarding its slowness in payments. To date, no formal action has
    been taken by the Company's creditors. However, no assurance can be given
    that the Company's creditors may not take such action. Historically, the
    operations have been highly seasonal with the second and third quarters of
    the calendar year producing significantly more cash flow than the first and
    fourth quarters.

(3) NONRECURRING EXPENSES

In February 1998, the Company entered into an agreement to sell all of their
    remaining Brasilia aircraft and their Brasilia spare part inventories and
    began negotiating with the lessors and creditors for release of the Brasilia
    aircraft. In April 1998, due to the expanded service into the Denver market,
    the Company determined that they had a continuing need for five of their
    Brasilia aircraft, and began negotiating with the other party for a
    modification of the agreement. The agreement to sell all the Brasilia
    aircraft was modified and the Company disposed of only two aircraft and
    utilizes the remaining Brasilia aircraft in its operations. As a result of
    the modification in the agreement to sell Brasilia aircraft, the Company
    reversed, in 1998, an accrual of $543,933 that was made in 1997 for the
    intended disposal of three Brasilia aircraft that did not occur. Offsetting,
    this reversal was an additional accrual of $689,738 needed for a final
    settlement reached regarding two Brasilia aircraft that were returned to a
    lessor in 1997, resulting in a net non-recurring charge of $145,805 in 1998.

(4) FLIGHT EQUIPMENT

The Company's airline fleet consisted of Beechcraft Model 1900 19-passenger and
    Embraer Brasilia Model 120 30-passenger aircraft summarized as follows at
    December 31, 2000 and 1999:

On April 23, 1998, the Company received twenty-two Beechcraft 1900D aircraft
    from Raytheon. The Company was paying $30,007 a month for each aircraft as
    rent to Raytheon. In July 1999, the Company purchased these aircraft through
    the issuance of notes payable to Raytheon.

(5) NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Raytheon Aircraft Corp. and its financing affiliates (collectively, "Raytheon")
    is the Company's primary aircraft supplier and largest creditor. The Company
    has financed all but one of its Beechcraft 1900 aircraft and one of its
    Brasilia aircraft pursuant to lease and debt agreements with Raytheon.
    Raytheon had also extended the Company a total of $10 million through a line
    of credit and a short-term note payable to finance the Company's operating
    cash needs (collectively, the "Raytheon Agreements"). The line of credit and
    a short-term note payable as extended, expired by their terms on June 30,
    1999. On January 7, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Coast
    Business Credit for a $20 million revolving credit facility. In connection
    with entering into the revolving credit facility, the Company paid Raytheon
    $5 million to retire the short-term note. On December 1, 2000 the Company
    entered into an agreement with Raytheon to convert the remaining line of
    credit into a three-year installment note.

(A) On January 7, 2000, the Company entered into a $20 million line of credit
    agreement with Coast Business Credit. Under the terms of the agreement the
    Company may borrow up to 85 percent of the Company's Eligible Billed and
    Unbilled Receivables as defined in the agreement. At December 31, 2000, the
    amount available under the agreement was $13,161,347 all of which had been
    borrowed. The line of credit bears interest at a rate of prime plus
    .5 percent and in no event shall the rate be less than 8 percent per annum.
    The line of credit also contains various restrictive covenants. The Company
    is in default under this agreement and is incurring a 3.0 percent-interest
    rate penalty as a result of not meeting financial requirements related to
    tangible net worth. At December 31, 2000 the interest rate was
    13.0 percent.

(B) The Company entered into a short-term note with Raytheon in July 1997. In
    January 2000, the note was paid in full in connection with the $20 million
    line of credit agreement with Coast Business Credit.

(C) The Company entered into a $2.5 million line of credit with Raytheon that
    was later amended and increased to $5.0 million. The line of credit was
    converted to a term note on December 1, 2000 and is classified in
    (D) below. The term note and interest is due over 36 monthly payments
    beginning June 30, 2001. The term note bears interest at prime rate, which
    was 9.5 percent at December 31, 2000 and is secured by Beech aircraft and is
    cross-collateralized with the other Raytheon Agreements.

Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31, 2000 and 1999:

(D) The Raytheon notes consist of 31 term notes in 2000 and 29 term notes in
    1999. On July 1, 1999, the Company entered into 22 term notes to purchase 22
    1900D Beechcraft airliners. The outstanding notes at December 31, 2000
    require monthly payments ranging from $30,000 to $84,500, including
    interest, with total payments on these notes approximating $1,223,000 per
    month. The interest rates on the notes range from 7.15 percent to
    8.5 percent as of December 31, 2000. The notes mature from

    October 2001 to August 2012 and are collateralized by aircraft. On
    November 1, 2000 the Company entered into an agreement converting certain
    deferred lease payments on 1900C aircraft to a term note. The note requires
    monthly payments through October, 2003 with an interest rate equal to prime
    which was 9.5 percent at December 31, 2000.

(E) Other long-term notes consist of four term notes which require monthly or
    quarterly payments including interest. The interest rates on the notes are
    approximately 9.05 percent at December 31, 2000. Three of these notes are
    collateralized by aircraft.

In connection with the refinancing of the Company's long-term notes, short term
    note agreements, and the restructuring of the Company's lease agreements,
    the Company issued Raytheon a warrant to purchase one million shares of the
    Company's stock, at the then current market price of the stock. The warrant
    was exercisable for ten years beginning July 16, 1998 at a price of $.75 per
    share. Accordingly, the Company recorded a discount equal to the estimated
    fair value of the warrant on the date of issuance ($650,000), which is being
    amortized as additional interest expense over the weighted average life of
    the debt and lease agreements to which it relates. On October 7, 2000 the
    Company exercised the call option of the warrant agreement, and paid
    $281,750 to retire the warrant.

As of December 31, 2000, the long-term debt obligations due in the five
    subsequent years and thereafter were as follows:

(7) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

    401(k)

The Company maintains a qualified 401(k) employee savings plan for the benefit
    of substantially all employees. The Company matches up to 4 percent of
    participating employees' contributions. Company contributions totaled
    $318,000 in 2000, $337,000 in 1999 and $268,000 in 1998.

    STOCK OPTION PLANS

The Company has adopted The Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd. Option Plan and the 1993
    Director Stock Option Plan (the Plans). The Plans permit the grant of
    qualified incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options covering in
    the aggregate 600,000 shares of the Company's common stock to be granted to
    key employees, officers, and directors of the Company. Options outstanding
    under the Plans become exercisable one-fifth in years one through five from
    the date of grant. The options expire after ten years from the date of
    grant. Options are forfeited upon termination for reasons other than
    retirement, death or disability.

(7) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED)

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting
    for the Plans, both of which are fixed stock option plans. Accordingly, no
    compensation cost has been recognized for the Plans as exercise prices are
    at least equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the
    date of grant. Had compensation cost for the Company's fixed stock option
    plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net (loss)
    income and (loss) income per share would have been impacted as follows:

    LITIGATION

The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit arising from the collision of a small
    aircraft with one of the Company's Beechcraft 1900 aircraft in Quincy,
    Illinois on November 19, 1996. The collision occurred at the intersection of

    adequately covered by insurance.

The Company is a party to other ongoing legal claims and assertions arising in

    resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The fourth quarter of 2000 contains certain year-end adjustments to accrued
    expenses of $1.2 million and certain receivables of approximately
    $2.5 million which relates to various periods. Additionally, overhaul
    activity was concentrated in the fourth quarter, increasing maintenance and
    related labor expense $2.6 million over the same period of the previous
    year.

For 2000 and 1999 the first and fourth quarters reflect a net loss, the effect
    of stock options and stock warrants are not included in the calculation of
    earnings per share because their effects are anti-dulitive. As a result, the
    total of the four quarters' diluted earnings per share will not equal the
    diluted earnings per share for the year.

Except as set forth above, the foregoing financial data includes normal
    recurring adjustments and, with the foregoing explanation, reflects all
    adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair
    presentation of such financial data. The Company's business is seasonal and,
    accordingly, interim results are not indicative of results for a full year.
