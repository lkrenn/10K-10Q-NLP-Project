ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

SkyWest, Inc. (the "Company"), through its wholly owned subsidiary, SkyWest
Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest"), operates one of the larger regional airlines in the
United States. SkyWest offers scheduled passenger and air freight service with
over 1,000 daily departures to 66 cities in 14 western states and Canada.
SkyWest has been a code-sharing partner with Delta Air Lines, Inc. ("Delta") in
Salt Lake City and United Airlines ("United") in Los Angeles since 1987 and
1997, respectively. In April 1998, SkyWest expanded its United Express Agreement
to provide service as United Express in United's Portland and Seattle/Tacoma
markets and in additional Los Angeles markets, which began in April 1998. In
January 1998, SkyWest expanded its operations to serve as the United Express
carrier in San Francisco, which began in June 1998. Today, SkyWest operates as
the Delta Connection in Salt Lake City and as United Express in Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Denver and in the Pacific Northwest. SkyWest believes that its
success in attracting multiple code-sharing relationships is attributable to its
delivery of high quality customer service with an all cabin-class fleet. As of
May 31, 2001, 53 percent of SkyWest's traffic was carried under the Delta code,
and 47 percent was carried under the United code. Additionally, 23.4 percent of
SkyWest's flights operated under the Delta code and 76.6 percent operated under
the United code. With principal hubs located at Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, San
Francisco, Portland and Seattle/Tacoma, SkyWest offers a convenient and frequent
flight schedule designed to maximize connecting and origin-destination traffic
for its major code-sharing partners. As of March 31, 2001, SkyWest operated a
fleet of 91 Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops ("Brasilias") and 17 Canadair
Regional Jets ("CRJs").

Multiple code-sharing relationships have enabled SkyWest to reduce reliance on
any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results
through a mix of SkyWest-controlled flying and contract flying. On
SkyWest-controlled flights, SkyWest controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares. On contract
routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories with SkyWest receiving from its major airline partners
negotiated payments per flight departure and incentives related to passenger
volumes and levels of customer service. As of March 31, 2001, approximately 69
percent of SkyWest's capacity was in contract flying and 31 percent was in
SkyWest-controlled flying. Another benefit of the multiple code-sharing
relationships is the ability to grow within two major airline systems. The
Company has agreements to acquire an additional 113 CRJs with options for an
additional 119 aircraft with deliveries which began in April 2001. These
aircraft will be allocated between Delta Connection and United Express
operations.

Since being founded in 1972, the Company has experienced significant growth.
During the past five fiscal years, consolidated operating revenues have
increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 21.2 percent, from $245.8
million in fiscal 1997 to $531.1 million in fiscal 2001. Total passengers
carried by SkyWest have increased from approximately 2,657,000 to approximately
5,677,000 over the same period. In fiscal 2001, the Company experienced growth
in available seat miles, revenue passenger miles, passengers carried and load
factors. The Company generated net income of $57.1 million in both fiscal 2001
and 2000 and $41.8 million in fiscal 1999. During fiscal 1999, the Company sold
the operations of Scenic Airlines, Inc., and recorded a loss on the sale of $0.8
million net of income taxes. The amount has been reflected as discontinued
operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements. During fiscal
2001, the Company sold the operations of National Parks Transportation in order
to focus on the core airline business and continued development of its Delta and
United relationships. The improvement since fiscal 1999 reflects, among other
factors, the addition of United as a code-sharing partner in October 1997.

JOINT MARKETING AND CODE SHARING AGREEMENTS

Since April 1987, SkyWest has operated as the Delta Connection in certain
SkyWest markets pursuant to the terms of a joint marketing and code sharing
agreement with Delta. In July 1990, SkyWest and Delta entered into a revised
Delta Connection Agreement, modified in April 1997 and May 1999, under which
SkyWest coordinates with Delta to facilitate interline connections at the Salt
Lake City International Airport. The primary benefit of this affiliation is the
use of the Delta designation code (DL) in listing flights in the Official
Airline Guide and in the computerized reservation systems used throughout the
industry. SkyWest's code sharing arrangement allocates to SkyWest, on



                                       3
<PAGE>   4

certain flights, a portion of the passenger fare on a formula or other basis,
subject to periodic adjustments. This code sharing agreement also provides for
negotiated minimum payments per flight departure and incentives related to
passenger volumes and levels of customer service, on certain flights. SkyWest
also participates in cooperative advertising and marketing activities with
Delta, including Delta's Frequent Flyer Program, the Delta Meeting Network and
Delta Dream Vacations.

The Company believes the arrangement created between SkyWest and Delta is
similar to those which exist between other major and regional airlines. The
Delta Connection Agreement terminates in June 2010, and is subject to earlier
termination in various circumstances, including upon 180 days advance notice by
either party for any or no reason. As of March 31, 2001, NewSky, Ltd., a
subsidiary of Delta, owned 6,215,596 shares of the Company's common stock, which
represents approximately 11.1 percent of the Company's outstanding common stock.
Pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement between Delta and the Company, Delta holds
preemptive rights and registration rights (two demand rights and unlimited
"piggy-back" rights) with respect to the common stock owned by Delta, as well as
the right to designate one nominee for the Company's Board of Directors, so long
as Delta owns at least ten percent of all outstanding shares of common stock.
Effective April 1, 1997, W. Martin Braham, Delta's designated Board member
resigned from the Board, at Delta's request. All Delta designated board members
of other regional airlines with similar arrangements also resigned. However, so
long as Delta is the owner of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding shares of
common stock, Delta has the right to include a designee of Delta reasonably
acceptable to the Company on the slate of nominees for election of directors
nominated by the Company's Board of Directors and the Company is obligated to
use its best efforts to assure the election of Delta's designee to the Board of
Directors. Delta has not designated a nominee to replace Mr. Braham and the
Company does not otherwise intend to nominate a replacement for the vacancy
created by Mr. Braham's resignation.

Effective October 1997, SkyWest began operating as a United Express carrier in
Los Angeles, under a United Express Agreement. The benefits under this agreement
are similar to those described under the Delta Connection agreement. This
agreement terminates on September 30, 2002. However, it may be terminated
earlier based on certain provisions in the agreement. United may also terminate
the agreement for convenience upon 180 days written notice. In April 1998,
SkyWest expanded its United Express Agreement to provide service as United
Express in United's Portland and Seattle/Tacoma markets and in additional Los
Angeles markets, which began in April 1998. In January 1998, SkyWest expanded
its operations to serve as the United Express carrier in San Francisco, which
began in June 1998. The amendment agreements executed in January and February
1998 terminate in May 2008. However, they may be terminated earlier based on
certain provisions in the agreements. The additional flights in Los Angeles
covered in the April 1998 agreement terminate on the same day as those in the
agreement dated October 1997. United may also terminate these agreements for
convenience upon 180 days written notice. On United Express routes, United
controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories with SkyWest
receiving from United negotiated minimum payments per flight departure and
incentives related to passenger and volumes and levels of customer service.

MARKETS AND ROUTES

SkyWest's flight schedules are structured to facilitate the connection of its
passengers with flights of Delta and United at the airports it serves. The

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

All interstate air carriers, including SkyWest, are subject to regulation by the
DOT, the FAA and certain other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by
the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA requires
operating, air worthiness and other certificates; approval of personnel who may
engage in flight, maintenance or operation activities; record keeping procedures
in accordance with FAA requirements; and FAA approval of flight training and
retraining programs. Generally, governmental agencies enforce their regulations
through, among other mechanisms, certifications, which are necessary for
SkyWest's continued operations, and proceedings, which can result in civil or
criminal penalties or revocation of operating authority. The FAA can also issue
maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other
things, grounding of aircraft, inspection of aircraft, installation of new
safety-related items and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts
that have failed or may fail in the future.

SkyWest believes it is operating in compliance with FAA regulations and holds
all necessary operating and airworthiness certificates and licenses. The Company
incurs substantial costs in maintaining current certifications and otherwise
complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject. SkyWest's
flight operations, maintenance programs, record keeping and training programs
are conducted under FAA approved procedures. SkyWest does not operate at any
airports where landing slots are restricted.

All air carriers are required to comply with federal laws and regulations
pertaining to noise abatement and engine emissions. All air carriers are also
subject to certain provisions of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, because of their extensive use of radio and other communication
facilities. The Company is also subject to certain other federal and state laws
relating to protection of the environment, labor relations and equal employment
opportunity. Management believes that the Company is in compliance in
all-material respects with these laws and regulations.

COMPETITION AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

The airline industry is highly competitive. The Company not only competes with
other regional airlines, some of which are owned by or are operated as code
sharing partners of major airlines, but also faces competition from low-fare
airlines and major airlines on certain routes. The Company is the dominant
regional airline operating out of the Salt Lake City International Airport:
however, Southwest Airlines, a national low-fare airline, also operates out of
the Salt Lake City International Airport, which results in significant price
competition at the Salt Lake City hub. Competition in the Southern California
and Pacific Northwest markets, which the Company serves from its hubs in Los
Angeles, Seattle/Tacoma and Portland, is particularly intense, with a large
number of carriers in these markets. The Company's principal competitor in the
Los Angeles International Airport is American Eagle. The Company's principal
competitor in the Seattle/Tacoma and Portland markets is Horizon Airlines.

The principal competitive factors in the regional airline industry are fare
pricing, customer service, routes served, flight schedules, aircraft types and
code-sharing relationships. Certain of the Company's competitors are larger and
have significantly greater financial resources than the Company. Moreover,
federal deregulation of the industry allows competitors to rapidly enter markets
and to quickly discount and restructure fares. The airline industry is
particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only
nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats.

Generally, the airline industry is highly sensitive to general economic
conditions, in large part due to the discretionary nature of a substantial
percentage of both business and pleasure travel. In the past, many airlines have
reported decreased earnings or substantial losses resulting from periods of
economic recession, heavy fare discounting and other factors. Economic downturns
combined with competitive pressures have contributed to a number of bankruptcies
and liquidations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic
downturns is somewhat mitigated by the Company's fixed-fee arrangements with
respect to certain flights. Nonetheless, the per passenger component in such fee
structures would be affected by an economic downturn. In addition, if the
Company's major airline code-sharing partners experience longer-term declines in
passenger loads or are injured by low ticket prices or high fuel prices, they
will likely seek to reduce the Company's fixed fees or cancel a number of
flights in order to reduce their costs.

EMPLOYEES

As of June 15, 2001, the Company employed 4,383 full-time equivalent employees
consisting of 1,715 pilots and flight attendants, 1,869 customer service
personnel, 557 mechanics and other maintenance personnel, and 242 administration
and support personnel. The Company's employees are not currently represented by
any union. However, the Company is aware that collective bargaining group
organization efforts among its employees occur from time to time and expect that
such efforts will continue in the future. During August 1999, the question of
whether or not to join the Airline Pilots Association ("ALPA") was submitted to
the Company's pilots, who voted against joining ALPA by a narrow margin. Under
governing rules, the Company's pilots may again vote on this issue at any time
because one year has passed since the previous vote. If unionization efforts are
successful, the Company may by subjected to risks of work interruption or
stoppage and/or incur additional expenses associated with union representation
of its employees. In connection with the Company's proposed acquisition of an
additional 113 CRJs and related expansion, the Company anticipates hiring
approximately 3,500 additional employees, many of whom may be represented by a
union in their current employment. The Company has never experienced any work
stoppages and considers its relationships with its employees to be very good.

SEASONALITY

As is common in the airline industry, SkyWest's operations are favorably
affected by increased travel, historically occurring in the summer months, and
are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from
November through January and by inclement weather which occasionally results in
cancelled flights, principally during the winter months. However, SkyWest does
expect some mitigation of the historical seasonal trends due to an increase in
the portion of its operations in contract flying.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various forward-looking statements and
information that are based on management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made
by and information currently available to management. When used in this
document, the words "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "expect," and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although the
Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will
prove to have been correct. Such statements are subject to certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or
uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected
or expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on the
Company's operating results include, among other things, changes in SkyWest's
code-sharing relationships, fluctuations in the economy and the demand for air
travel, the degree and nature of competition and SkyWest's ability to expand
services in new and existing markets and to maintain profit margins in the face
of pricing pressures.

SkyWest's aircraft are turboprop and jet pressurized aircraft designed to
operate more economically over short-haul routes with lower passenger load
factors than larger jet aircraft. These factors make it economically feasible
for SkyWest to provide high frequency service in markets with relatively low
volumes of passenger traffic. Passenger comfort features of these aircraft
include stand-up headroom, a lavatory, overhead baggage compartments and flight
attendant service. Fiscal year 1995 marked the introduction of the CRJs. SkyWest
currently operates 26 of these aircraft on stage lengths up to 850 miles.

During fiscal 2001, SkyWest took delivery of six CRJs in connection with the
Delta Connection and United Express expansion. Additionally, as of March 31,
2001 SkyWest had agreed to acquire an additional 113 CRJs and related spare
parts inventory and support equipment at an aggregate cost of approximately $2.4
billion. SkyWest commenced delivery of these aircraft in April 2001 and
deliveries are scheduled to continue through December 2004. Depending on the
state of the aircraft financing market at the time of delivery, management will
determine whether to acquire these aircraft through third party, long-term loans
or lease agreements. SkyWest also has options to acquire 119 additional CRJs at
fixed prices (subject to cost escalations) and the delivery schedules are
exercisable at various dates through April 2008.

GROUND FACILITIES

Employees of SkyWest perform substantially all routine airframe and engine
maintenance and periodic inspection of equipment. Maintenance is performed
primarily at facilities in Palm Springs, California, Salt Lake City, Utah, and
Fresno, California. SkyWest owns a 56,600 square foot maintenance facility in
Palm Springs, California and leases a 90,000 square foot aircraft maintenance
and training facility at the Salt Lake City International Airport. The facility
consists of a 40,000 square foot maintenance hangar and 50,000 square feet of
training and other facilities. The facility was constructed and is owned by the
Salt Lake City Airport Authority. SkyWest is leasing the facility under an
operating lease arrangement over a 36-year term. The Company also leases a
90,000 square foot maintenance hanger and 15,000 square foot office facility in
Fresno, California. SkyWest began construction on an additional aircraft
maintenance and training facility in Salt Lake City during September 2000. It is
estimated that the facility will be completed and operational by July 2001. The
facility is 131,300 square feet, consisting of a 58,400 square foot maintenance
hangar and 72,900 square feet of training and office space. It is anticipated
that the facility will be owned by the Salt Lake City Airport Authority and will
be leased to SkyWest under a long-term lease arrangement.

SkyWest leases ticket counters, check-in and boarding and other facilities in
the passenger terminal areas in the majority of the airports it serves and
staffs these facilities with SkyWest personnel. Delta and United provide ticket
handling and/or ground support services for SkyWest in 33 of the 68 airports
SkyWest serves.

The Company's corporate headquarters are located in a 63,000 square foot
building in St. George, Utah. The Company is in the construction phase for an
additional building adjacent to its current corporate headquarters in St.
George, Utah. It is estimated that the facility will be completed and
operational in November 2001. The facility will consist of approximately 55,000
square feet and will include office space for maintenance management and flight
operations including pilot management, dispatch and flight attendant management.
The facility will be owned by the Company and will be internally funded with
cash generated from operations. Management deems the Company's current and
planned facilities as being suitable and necessary to support existing
operations and believes the Company's facilities will be adequate for the
foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to certain legal actions, which it considers routine to
its business activities. As of March 31, 2001, management believes, after the
consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate outcome of such legal matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.


ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2001.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
                         ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE


To SkyWest, Inc.:

We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States, the consolidated financial statements included in SkyWest, Inc.'s
Annual Report to Shareholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and
have issued our report thereon dated May 16, 2001. Our audits were made for the
purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a
whole. The schedule listed in Item 14 (a)(2) is the responsibility of the
Company's management and is presented for the purpose of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.
