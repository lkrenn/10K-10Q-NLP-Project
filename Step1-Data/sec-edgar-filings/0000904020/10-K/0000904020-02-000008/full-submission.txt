     General

           Atlantic Coast Airlines Holdings, Inc. ("ACAI"), is a  holding
company  with  its  primary  subsidiary  being  Atlantic  Coast  Airlines
("ACA"), a regional airline serving 64 destinations in 28 states  in  the
Eastern and Midwestern United States and Canada as of March 1, 2002  with
760  scheduled non-stop flights system-wide every weekday.   On  July  1,
2001,  ACAI  combined  the  operations of its Atlantic  Coast  Jet,  Inc.
("ACJet")  subsidiary into the operations of ACA.  As a result,  ACA  now
operates under its marketing agreements as both a United Express  carrier
with  United Air Lines, Inc. ("United") and as a Delta Connection carrier
with  Delta  Air  Lines, Inc. ("Delta").  United Express  operations  are
conducted  throughout the Eastern and Central United States, while  Delta
Connection  operations are conducted predominately  in  the  Northeastern
United  States  and Canada.  Unless the context indicates otherwise,  the
terms  "the Company", "we", "us", or "our" refer herein to Atlantic Coast
Airlines  Holdings,  Inc.  As of March 1, 2002, the  Company  operated  a
fleet of 124 aircraft (93 regional jets and 31 turboprop aircraft) having
an average age of approximately three years.

     Recent Developments

           On  September 11, 2001, two United airplanes and two  American
Airlines,  Inc. airplanes were hijacked and used in terrorist attacks  on
the  United States.  As a result of these terrorist attacks, the  Federal
Aviation  Administration ("FAA") issued a federal ground stop order  that
required  the immediate suspension of all commercial airline  flights  on
the  morning  of  September  11, 2001.  The  Company  recommenced  flight
operations  on  September 14 at reduced levels from its pre-September  11
schedule.  The events of September 11, together with the slowing  economy
throughout  2001,  has significantly affected the U.S. airline  industry.
These events have resulted in changed government regulation, declines and
shifts  in passenger demand, higher insurance rates and tightened  credit
markets  which continue to affect the operations and financial  condition
of  participants in the U.S. airline industry and may affect the  Company
in  ways  that  it is not currently able to predict.  See,  for  example,
"Business  -  Insurance,"  "Business  -  Regulation,"  and  "Management's
Discussion   and  Analysis  of  Results  of  Operations   and   Financial
Condition," below.

     Marketing Agreements

          The  Company derives substantially all of its revenues  through
its marketing agreements with United and Delta.

     United Express:

          The  Company's  United  Express  Agreements  ("UA  Agreements")
define  the  Company's relationship with United.  In November  2000,  the
Company  and  United amended and restated the UA Agreements,  effectively
changing   from  a  prorated  fare  arrangement  to  a  fee-per-departure
arrangement.  Under the UA Agreements in effect prior to  November  2000,
the  Company  was responsible for scheduling, marketing and  pricing  its
flights, in coordination with United's operations, and paid a portion  of
fares  it  received to United.  Under the fee-per-departure structure  in
effect as of December 1, 2000, the Company is contractually obligated  to
operate a flight schedule designated by United, for which United pays the
Company  an  agreed  amount per departure regardless  of  the  number  of
passengers   carried,  with  incentive  payments  based  on   operational
performance.   The  Company  thereby assumes the  risks  associated  with
operating  the flight schedule and United assumes the risk of scheduling,
marketing,  and selling seats to the traveling public.  The  restated  UA
Agreements are for a term of ten years.  The restated UA Agreements  give
ACA  the  authority  to operate 128 regional jets in the  United  Express
operation.  By operating under the UA Agreements, the Company is able  to
use  United's  "UA"  flight  designator code to  identify  the  Company's
flights  and  fares  in  the major airline Computer Reservation  Systems,
including  United's "Apollo" reservation system, and to  use  the  United
Express logo and exterior aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar  to
those of United.

          Pursuant  to  the restated UA Agreements, United,  at  its  own
expense,  provides a number of additional services to ACA. These  include
customer  reservations,  customer service, pricing,  scheduling,  revenue
accounting,    revenue   management,   frequent   flyer   administration,
advertising, provision of ground support services at most of the airports
served  by both United and ACA, provision of ticket handling services  at
United's  ticketing  locations,  and  provision  of  airport  signage  at
airports   where  both  ACA  and  United  operate.   Under  the  restated
agreement, the Company remains responsible for fees associated  with  the
major  airline  Computer Reservation Systems. The UA  Agreements  do  not
prohibit United from serving, or from entering into agreements with other
airlines  who would serve, routes served by the Company, but  state  that
United  may  terminate the UA Agreements if ACAI  or  ACA  enter  into  a
similar  arrangement  with  any  other carrier  other  than  Delta  or  a
replacement  for Delta without United's prior written approval.   The  UA
Agreements  limit  the  ability of ACAI and ACA  to  merge  with  another
company or dispose of certain assets or aircraft without offering  United
a  right  of  first  refusal to acquire the Company  or  such  assets  or
aircraft,  and  provide United a right to terminate the UA Agreements  if
ACAI  or ACA merge with or are controlled or acquired by another carrier.
The UA agreements provide United with the right to assume ACA's ownership
or  leasehold  interest  in certain aircraft in the  event  ACA  breaches
specified  provisions of the UA agreements, or fails  to  meet  specified
performance standards.
<PAGE> 4

          The  UA  Agreements call for the resetting of fee-for-departure
rates annually based on the Company's planned level of operations for the
upcoming year. On December 31, 2001, the Company and United agreed on fee-
per-departure rates to be utilized during 2002.  Under the terms of  this
agreement  the  Company and United settled prior contract issues,  agreed
that  there would be no adjustment for utilization changes in the  fourth
quarter  of  2001,  agreed to aggressively contain  costs  in  2002,  and
committed to a J-41 retirement plan.

     Delta Connection:

          In  September  1999,  the Company reached a ten-year  agreement
with  Delta  to  operate  regional jet aircraft  as  part  of  the  Delta
Connection program on a fee-per-block hour basis. The Company began Delta
Connection  revenue  service  on August 1,  2000.   The  Company's  Delta
Connection  Agreement ("DL Agreement") defines the Company's relationship
with  Delta. The Company is compensated by Delta on a fee-per-block  hour
basis.    Under  the  fee-per-block  hour  structure,  the   Company   is
contractually obligated to operate a flight schedule designated by Delta,
for  which  Delta pays the Company an agreed amount per block hour  flown
regardless  of the number of passengers carried, with incentive  payments
based  on operational performance.  The Company thereby assumes the risks
associated with operating the flight schedule and Delta assumes the risks
of  scheduling, marketing, and selling seats to the traveling public.  By
operating as part of the Delta Connection program, the Company is able to
use Delta's "DL" flight designator to identify ACA's flights and fares in
the  major  Computer Reservation Systems, including Delta's  "Deltamatic"
reservation  system, and to use the Delta Connection  logo  and  exterior
aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to those of Delta.

          Pursuant to the DL Agreement, Delta, at its expense, provides a
number  of support services to ACA.  These include customer reservations,
customer   service,   ground  handling,  station   operations,   pricing,
scheduling,  revenue  accounting,  revenue  management,  frequent   flyer
administration,  advertising and other passenger,  aircraft  and  traffic
servicing  functions  in connection with the ACA  operation.   Delta  may
terminate  the DL Agreement at any time if the Company fails to  maintain
certain  performance  standards and, subject to  certain  rights  of  the
Company  and  by providing 180 days notice to the Company, may  terminate
without  cause.   If Delta terminates the Delta agreement  without  cause
prior to March 2010, the Company has the right to sell all or some of the
Delta Connection aircraft to Delta.  In January 2001, the Company reached
an  agreement with United and Delta to place 20 CRJ's originally  ordered
for  the Delta Connection program in the United Express program.  The  DL
Agreement  requires the Company to obtain Delta's approval if it  chooses
to  enter into a code-sharing arrangement with another carrier other than
a replacement for United, to list its flights under any other code, or to
operate  flights  for  any other carrier, except  with  respect  to  such
arrangements with United or non-U.S. code-share partners of United or  in
certain  other  circumstances.  The DL Agreement does not prohibit  Delta
from  serving, or from entering into agreements with other  airlines  who
would  serve,  routes  flown  by  the Company.   The  DL  Agreement  also
restricts  the ability of the Company to dispose of aircraft  subject  to
the  agreement without offering Delta a right of first refusal to acquire
such  aircraft,  and  provides that Delta may  extend  or  terminate  the
agreement  if, among other things, the Company merges with or  sells  its
assets  to another entity, is acquired by another entity or if any person
acquires more than a specified percentage of its stock.
<PAGE> 5
          Due  to  the  rapid  increase in fleet size  during  2001,  the
Company  and Delta agreed to compensation for 2001 utilizing a cost  plus
formula  based  on  reimbursement  of fixed  amounts  for  initial  pilot
training  expenses  and  for  all other  costs,  based  on  actual  costs
incurred,  plus a contracted margin, and incentive compensation  tied  to
operating performance.  The Company and Delta have agreed to return to  a
fee-per-block hour rate arrangement for 2002.  The Company and Delta  are
currently  setting these rates based on the Company's  planned  level  of
operations  for  the  upcoming year.   The Company  does  not  anticipate
material  differences on a per-block-hour basis for its 2002 revenues  as
compared  to  2001  revenues due to the reversion to a fee-per-block-hour
rate.

     Agreements with Other Airlines:

          As  of  March  1, 2002 the Company has implemented code-sharing
arrangements  with Lufthansa German Airlines ("Lufthansa"),  Air  Canada,
and Scandinavian Airlines involving certain United Express flights.  Such
international code-sharing arrangements permit these foreign air carriers
to  place  their respective airline codes on certain flights operated  by
ACA,  and  provide  a  wide  range of benefits for  passengers  including
schedule    coordination,   through   ticketing   and   frequent    flyer
participation.  The  revenue benefits from these arrangements  inures  to
United,  and  any  such arrangements as may be made in  the  future  with
respect  to the Company's Delta Connection flights would inure to  Delta,
due  to  the nature of the Company's agreements with these two  airlines.
Thus  the  Company's primary role under these arrangements is  to  obtain
regulatory approvals for the relationships and to operate the flights.

     Charter Operations

          The  Company established a charter operation in February  2002.
The Company is presently providing regular private shuttle service to two
destinations  pursuant  to  an agreement with  a  major  corporation  and
performing  ad  hoc  charter services secured through brokers  and  other
means.   The  charter business is solicited and managed  by  a  dedicated
management  team  separate  from those involved  in  airline  operations,
utilizing the Company's operations and maintenance services.  The Company
has ordered three 328JETs for its charter business, one of which has been
delivered  and  the others of which are scheduled to be delivered  during
the second quarter of 2002.

     Markets

            The  Company's  United Express operation is  centered  around
Washington's Dulles and Chicago's O'Hare airports.  During 2001 and 2002,
the  Company has greatly increased its Chicago operation such that as  of
March 2002, 55% of the Company's United Express capacity (as measured  in
available  seat  miles) is flown to/from Chicago's O'Hare  airport.   The
growth  in  Chicago results from the combination of adding  complementary
service  to  United mainline service in 14 markets and  replacing  United
mainline service completely in 11 markets during 2001.
<PAGE> 6
          The  Delta  Connection  operation  is  focused  at  New  York's
LaGuardia  airport,  Boston's  Logan  airport  and  Cincinnati   Northern
Kentucky  International airport.  As of March 2002, 42% of the  Company's
Delta  Connection capacity (as measured in available seat miles)  was  at
LaGuardia, 31% was at Boston, and 27% was at Cincinnati.

     Fleet Description

          Fleet Expansion:    As of March 1, 2002, the Company operated a
fleet  of  60  Canadair Regional Jets ("CRJs"), 33 Fairchild Dornier  328
regional jets ("328JET"), and 31 British Aerospace Jetstream-41 ("J-41s")
turboprop  aircraft.    Thirty  328JETs  are  operated  under  the  Delta
Connection program, 59 CRJs, two 328JETs and 31 J-41's are operated under
the  United  Express program, and one 328JET and one  CRJ  are  currently
dedicated to charter operations.

          As of March 1, 2002, the Company had a total of 36 CRJs on firm
order from Bombardier, Inc., in addition to the 60 already delivered, and
held options for 80 additional CRJs.  The Company also had 32 328JETs  on
firm  order  from  Fairchild-Dornier,  in  addition  to  the  33  already
delivered,  and held options for an additional 81 aircraft.   In  January
2001, the Company reached an agreement with United and Delta to place  20
CRJs  originally ordered for the Delta Connection program in  the  United
Express  Program.  The future delivery schedule of the remaining 68  firm
ordered  regional  jet aircraft undelivered as of March  1,  2002  is  as
follows:  16 CRJs for delivery during the remainder of 2002 and  20  CRJs
for delivery in 2003, and 10 328JETs for delivery during the remainder of
2002 and 22 328JETs in 2003.

           Turboprop Retirement:  During the fourth quarter of 2001,  the
Company  recorded  an aircraft early retirement charge of  $23.5  million
($14.0  million  after  tax)  for the early  retirement  of  nine  leased
Jetstream-41 turboprop aircraft, which the Company plans to  remove  from
service   prior  to  year-end  2002.   The  Company  anticipates   taking
additional  charges  during  2002 of approximately  $48  million  pre-tax
($28.4  million  after-tax) for the retirement of its  remaining  29-seat
Jetstream-41  turboprop  aircraft.  Fairchild  Dornier  GMBH  ("Fairchild
Dornier"), the manufacturer of the 328JETS, is contractually obligated to
make the Company whole for any difference between lease payments, if any,
received from remarketing the 26 J-41 aircraft leased by the Company  and
the   lease  payment  obligations  of  the  Company  on  those  aircraft.
Fairchild  Dornier  also has agreed to purchase the  five  J-41  aircraft
owned  by  the Company at their net book value at the time of retirement.
See  "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of  Operations  and
Financial  Condition - Outlook and Business Risks" below.  In  2001,  the
Company completed the early retirement of the 19 seat J-32 turboprop fleet
and  reversed approximately $500,000 of excess aircraft early  retirement
charges that had been expensed in 2000.

          In  March  2001, the Company reached agreement with the  lessor
for the early return and lease termination of the 28 19-seat Jetstream-32
turboprop  aircraft  formerly utilized in the  Company's  United  Express
operations.   Under this agreement, the Company paid a lease  termination
fee, which consisted of $19.1 million in cash and the application of $5.2
million in credits due from the lessor.  The Company completed the  early
retirement of these aircraft from its fleet and returned the aircraft  to
the  lessor during 2001. The Company is in the process of completing  the
disposal  of  spare  parts  and has certain  oversight  obligations  with
respect  to seven aircraft until July 2003, but does not expect to  incur
any additional charges against earnings for the early retirement of the J-
32 fleet.
<PAGE> 10
     Fuel

          The   Company  has  not  experienced  difficulties  with   fuel
availability  and expects to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing  prices
in  quantities  sufficient to meet its future  requirements.   Delta  Air
Lines,  Inc. bears the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations  for  the
fuel  requirements of the Company's Delta Connection program, and  United
Airlines  bears such risk for the Company's United Express  program.   As
such, the Company reasonably expects that its results of operations  with
United and Delta will not be directly affected by fuel price volatility.

     Insurance

          Following  the  September 11 terrorist  attacks,  the  aviation
insurance  industry  imposed a worldwide surcharge on aviation  insurance
rates  as  well as a reduction in coverage for certain war  risks.     In
response to the reduction in coverage, the Air Transportation Safety  and
System  Stabilization Act provided U.S. air carriers with the  option  to
purchase  certain  war risk liability insurance from  the  United  States
government  on  an  interim basis at rates that are more  favorable  than
those available from the private market.   The Company has purchased this
coverage through May 19, 2002 and anticipates renewing it for as long  as
the  coverage  is available from the U.S. government.  The  airlines  and
insurance   industry,  together  with  the  United   States   and   other
governments,  are continuing to evaluate both the cost  and  options  for
providing  coverage  of  aviation insurance.  Recently,  an  industry-led
group  announced a proposal to create a mutual insurance company,  to  be
called  Equitime,  to  cover  war risk and terrorism  risk,  which  would
initially  seek  support through government guarantees.   Equitime  would
provide  a  competitive alternative to insurance  being  offered  by  the
traditional insurance market, which opposes this initiative.   Equitime's
organizers project that it may be available to provide insurance as early
as May 2002 to up to 70 U.S. carriers.  The Company has not been actively
involved in the formation of Equitime and is unable to anticipate whether
this  source of insurance will be made available and, if so,  whether  it
will  offer  competitive  rates.  The Company anticipates  that  it  will
follow industry practices with respect to sources of insurance.

     Competition

          Under  the  Company's fee arrangements with United  and  Delta,
United  and  Delta  are  responsible  for  establishing  routes  and  fee
structure, and the Company's revenue is not directly related to passenger
revenue  earned by United or Delta on its flights.  However, the  overall
system benefit to those airlines is likely to affect the Company in  such
areas as future growth opportunities.

     Slots

           Slots  are reservations for takeoffs and landings at specified
times  and are required by governmental authorities to operate at certain
airports.   The  Company has rights to and utilizes takeoff  and  landing
slots at Chicago-O'Hare and LaGuardia, Kennedy and White Plains, New York
airports.  The Company also uses slot exemptions at Chicago-O'Hare, which
differ  from  slots in that they allow service only to designated  cities
and  are not transferable to other airlines without the approval  of  the
U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT").  Airlines may acquire slots by
governmental grant, by lease or purchase from other airlines, or by  loan
when   another  airline  does  not  use  a  slot  but  desires  to  avoid
governmental  reallocation of a slot for lack of  use.   All  leased  and
loaned  slots  are subject to renewal and termination provisions.   Under
rules  presently in effect, all slot regulation is scheduled  to  end  at
Chicago-O'Hare  after  July 1, 2002 and at LaGuardia  and  Kennedy  after
January 1, 2007.  The rules also provide that, in addition to those slots
currently held by carriers, operators of regional jet aircraft may  apply
for, and the Secretary of Transportation must grant, additional slots  at
Chicago, LaGuardia, and Kennedy in order to permit the carriers to  offer
new service, increase existing service or upgrade to regional jet service
in  qualifying smaller communities.  There is no limit on the  number  of
slots a carrier may request.
<PAGE> 11
          The  ability of regional carriers to obtain slots at  LaGuardia
in  large  numbers led to an increase in flight activity at  the  airport
that  exceeded  the capacity of LaGuardia.  As a result,  and  to  reduce
airport congestion and delays, the FAA implemented a slot lottery  system
resulting  in a decrease in the operation of new regional jet service  to
and  from LaGuardia including ACA services operated for Delta.   The  FAA
has  stated that the slot lottery is a temporary measure, and that it  is
considering   implementing  a  long-term  solution  that  could   involve
increasing  landing and other fees to discourage operations  during  peak
hours.   To  the  extent  other  airports experience  significant  flight
delays,  the FAA or local airport operators could seek to impose  similar
peak  period  pricing systems or other demand-reducing strategies,  which
could  impede the Company's ability to serve or increase service  at  any
such impacted airport.

     Employees

            As  of March 1, 2002, the Company had 3,601 full-time and 391
part-time employees, classified as follows:

           Total employees              3,601      391
</TABLE>

          The  Company's  pilots are represented by  the  Airline  Pilots
Association   ("ALPA"),  flight  attendants  are   represented   by   the
Association  of  Flight  Attendants  ("AFA"),  and  aviation  maintenance
technicians and ground service equipment mechanics are represented by the
Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association ("AMFA").

           In  January  2001, the Company agreed to a new four-and-a-half
year  contract  with its pilot union that was subsequently  ratified  and
became   effective  on  February  9,  2001.   The  collective  bargaining
agreement  covers pilots flying for the United Express, Delta Connection,
and  charter  operations.   The new agreement  provides  for  substantial
increases  in pilot compensation and improvements in benefits,  training,
and  other  matters, which the Company believes are consistent  with  the
regional airline industry.

          ACA's collective bargaining agreement with AFA was ratified  in
October  1998.   The  agreement is for a four-year duration  and  becomes
amendable  in October 2002.  This agreement covers all flight  attendants
working  for the Company.  The collective bargaining agreement with  AMFA
was ratified in June 1998.  The agreement is for a four-year duration and
becomes  amendable  in June 2002.   This agreement  covers  all  aviation
maintenance  technicians and ground service equipment  mechanics  working
for the Company.
<PAGE> 12
          The   Company   believes   that  certain   of   the   Company's
unrepresented  labor  groups are from time to time approached  by  unions
seeking to represent them.  However, as of March 1, 2002, the Company has
not  received any official notice of organizing activity and  there  have
been  no  representation applications filed with the  National  Mediation
Board  by any of these groups.  The Company believes that the wage  rates
and  benefits  for  non-union employee groups are comparable  to  similar
groups at other regional airlines.

          The  Company  continues  to emphasize employee  recruiting  and
retention efforts and to hire personnel to accommodate its growth  plans.
Recently the Company has benefited from a decline in attrition due to the
softening  of  the  national economy.  However, due  to  fluctuations  in
industry  hiring  demands, a competitive local labor market  in  Northern
Virginia and the potential for the resumption of normal attrition,  there
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to meet its
hiring requirements.

     Pilot Training

          The   Company   has  entered  into  agreements  with   Pan   Am
International Flight Academy ("PAIFA"), which allow the Company to  train
CRJ,  J-41  and 328JET pilots at PAIFA's facility near Washington-Dulles.
In  2001,  PAIFA  relocated its Washington-Dulles  operations  to  a  new
training facility housing two CRJ simulators, a 328JET simulator, and a J-
41  simulator  near  the Company's Washington-Dulles  headquarters.   The
Company has agreements to purchase an annual minimum number of CRJ and J-
41  simulator training hours at agreed rates, through 2010 for  the  CRJ,
and 2002 for the J-41.  The Company's payment obligations for CRJ and  J-
41  simulator  usage  over the remaining years of  the  agreements  total
approximately $12.5 million.

          In  2001,  a simulator provision and service agreement  between
PAIFA,  CAE  Schreiner and the Company was executed and  328JET  training
commenced  at the PAIFA facility.  Under this agreement, the Company  has
committed  to  purchase all of its 328JET simulator time  from  PAIFA  at
agreed  upon rates, with no minimum number of simulator hours guaranteed.
A second 328JET simulator is scheduled for installation at the Washington-
Dulles PAIFA simulator facility in July 2002.

     Regulation

          Economic.    The  Department  of  Transportation  ("DOT")   has
extensive authority to issue certificates authorizing carriers to  engage
in   air   transportation,  establish  consumer  protection  regulations,
prohibit  certain  unfair or anti-competitive pricing practices,  mandate
conditions  of  carriage and make ongoing determinations of  a  carrier's
fitness, willingness and ability to provide air transportation.  The  DOT
can  bring  proceedings  for the enforcement  of  its  regulations  under
applicable  federal  statutes,  which proceedings  may  result  in  civil
penalties, revocation of operating authority or criminal sanctions.

          The  Company's  ACA  subsidiary holds a certificate  of  public
convenience  and  necessity, issued by the DOT,  that  authorizes  it  to
conduct scheduled and charter air transportation of persons, property and
mail  between  all  points  in  the United States,  its  territories  and
possessions.  In addition, ACA may conduct charters to points outside the
United  States,  subject to obtaining any necessary  authority  from  any
foreign  country  to be so served.  This certificate  requires  that  ACA
maintain  DOT-prescribed  minimum levels of insurance,  comply  with  all
applicable  statutes  and regulations and remain  continuously  "fit"  to
engage  in  air  transportation.  In addition to this authority,  ACA  is
authorized to engage in air transportation between the United States  and
Canada.
<PAGE> 13
          The  Company's  ACJet subsidiary also holds  a  certificate  of
public  convenience and necessity, issued by the DOT, that authorizes  it
to  conduct scheduled and charter air transportation of persons, property
and  mail  between all points in the United States, its  territories  and
possessions.  On July 1, 2001, the Company combined the operations of its
ACJet  subsidiary into the operations of Atlantic Coast Airlines.   ACJet
is  now a dormant company with its only assets being its DOT and FAA  air
carrier  operating certificates.  The certificates issued  to  ACJet  are
subject to revocation for dormancy as of July 1, 2001.

          Based  on  conditions  in  the industry,  or  as  a  result  of
Congressional directives or statutes, the DOT from time to time  proposes
and adopts new regulations or amends existing regulations that may impose
additional  regulatory burdens and costs on the Company.    In  addition,
air  carriers  may volunteer to impose new or additional requirements  on
themselves to address Congressional concerns or concerns expressed by the
public, such as passenger rights initiatives.  Imposition of new laws and
regulations  on air carriers or agreement on voluntary initiatives  could
increase   the  cost  of  operation  and  or  limit  carrier   management
discretion.

          Safety.   The  FAA  extensively  regulates  the  safety-related
activities  of  air  carriers.   The Company  is  subject  to  the  FAA's
jurisdiction  with  respect  to  aircraft  maintenance  and   operations,
equipment, ground facilities, flight dispatch, communications,  training,
weather   observation,   flight   personnel,   airport   security,    the
transportation  of  hazardous materials and other matters  affecting  air
safety.  To ensure compliance with its regulations, the FAA requires that
airlines  under  its  jurisdiction obtain an  operating  certificate  and
operations  specifications  for  the particular  aircraft  and  types  of
operations  conducted  by  such airlines.  The Company's  ACA  subsidiary
possesses an operating certificate and related authorities issued by  the
FAA  authorizing  it  to conduct operations with turboprop  and  turbojet
equipment.   The  Company,  like  all  carriers,  requires  specific  FAA
authority  to  add  aircraft to its fleet.  ACA's  authority  to  conduct
operations  is  subject  to suspension, modification  or  revocation  for
cause.   The  FAA  has  authority to bring  proceedings  to  enforce  its
regulations, which proceedings may result in civil or criminal  penalties
or revocation of operating authority.

          The  Company's  ACJet  subsidiary was  issued  by  the  FAA  an
operating  certificate and related authorities authorizing it to  conduct
operations  with  turbojet  equipment.  On  July  1,  2001,  the  Company
combined  the  operations of its ACJet subsidiary into the operations  of
Atlantic Coast Airlines.

           From  time  to the time and with varying degrees of intensity,
the  FAA conducts inspections of air carriers.  Such inspections  may  be
scheduled  or  unscheduled  and  may  be  triggered  by  specific  events
involving  either  the  specific carrier being  inspected  or  other  air
carriers.  In addition, the FAA may require airlines to demonstrate  that
they  have  the  capacity to properly manage growth  and  safely  operate
increasing numbers of aircraft.
<PAGE> 14
          In  order  to  ensure  the  highest  level  of  safety  in  air
transportation, the FAA has authority to issue maintenance directives and
other  mandatory  orders.   These relate  to,  among  other  things,  the
inspection of aircraft and the mandatory removal and replacement of parts
or  structures.   In  addition, the FAA from  time  to  time  amends  its
regulations and such amended regulations may impose additional regulatory
burdens  on the Company, such as the required installation of new safety-
related  items.  Depending upon the scope of the FAA's orders and amended
regulations,   these  requirements  may  cause  the  Company   to   incur
substantial,  unanticipated expenses that may not be  reimbursable  under
the  Company's  marketing  agreements. The FAA enforces  its  maintenance
regulations  by  the  imposition  of  civil  penalties,  which   can   be
substantial.

          On November 19, 2001 the President signed into law the Aviation
and  Transportation Security Act (the "Security Act").  The Security  Act
requires heightened passenger, baggage and cargo security measures to  be
adopted  as  well as enhanced airport security procedures.  The  Security
Act  created the Transportation Security Administration ("TSA") that  has
taken  over the responsibility for conducting the screening of passengers
and  their baggage at the nation's airports as of February 17, 2002.  The
activities  of the TSA are to be funded in part by the application  of  a
$2.50  per  passenger enplanement security fee (subject to a  maximum  of
$5.00  per one way trip) and payment by all passenger carriers of  a  sum
not  exceeding  each  carrier's  passenger  and  baggage  screening  cost
incurred in calendar year 2000.  The TSA is charged to have equipment  in
operation  by  the  end of 2002 to be able to electronically  screen  all
checked passenger baggage with explosive detection systems.  The  TSA  is
also  required to deploy federal air marshals on an increased  number  of
passenger flights.

          The Security Act imposes new and increased requirements for air
carrier  employee background checks and additional security  training  of
flight  and  cabin crew personnel.  These additional and new requirements
may increase the security related costs of the Company.  The Security Act
also   mandates  and  the  FAA  has  adopted  new  rules  requiring   the
strengthening  of  cockpit  doors, some of the  costs  of  which  may  be
reimbursed by the FAA.  The Company has completed level one fortification
of its cockpit doors on all of its aircraft as of November 15, 2001.  The
FAA  has mandated additional cockpit door modifications that will  result
in  additional costs.  The Company intends to apply for reimbursement  of
these costs and other security costs for which the FAA has established  a
cost  reimbursement program. There is no guarantee that the Company  will
be  reimbursed in full for the cost of these modifications. New passenger
and baggage screening requirements have caused disruptions in the flow of
passengers through airports and in some cases delayed airline operations.
The  Company  may experience security-related disruptions in the  future,
including reduced passenger demand for air travel, but believes that  its
exposure  to  such disruptions is not greater than that  faced  by  other
providers of regional air carrier services.

          Although the TSA has taken over the former responsibilities  of
the air carriers for the screening of all passengers and baggage, the FAA
continues  to  require  air  carriers to  adopt  and  enforce  procedures
designed  to  safeguard  property, and ensure  airport  and  aircraft  to
protect  against  terrorist acts.  The FAA, from time  to  time,  imposes
additional  security requirements on air carriers and airport authorities
based  on  specific threats or world conditions or as otherwise required.
The  FAA  has  issued  a  number  of security  directives  following  the
September 11 terrorist attacks, and the Company has adjusted its security
procedures  on  numerous occasions in response to these directives.   The
Company  incurs  substantial expense in complying with  current  security
requirements  and it cannot predict what additional security requirements
may  be  imposed  in  the  future or the  cost  of  complying  with  such
requirements.
<PAGE> 15
          Associated  with  the  FAA's  security  responsibility  is  its
program to ensure compliance with rules regulating the transportation  of
hazardous   materials.   The  Company  has  policies  against   accepting
hazardous   materials  or  other  dangerous  goods  for   transportation.
Employees  of  the  Company are trained in the recognition  of  hazardous
materials  and  dangerous goods through an FAA approved training  course.
The  Company  may  ship aircraft and other parts and equipment,  some  of
which  may  be classified as hazardous materials, using the  services  of
third party carriers, both ground and air.  In acting in the capacity  of
a shipper of hazardous materials, the Company must comply with applicable
regulations.  The FAA enforces its hazardous material regulations by  the
imposition of civil penalties, which can be substantial.

          Other Regulation.  In the maintenance of its aircraft fleet and
ground  equipment, the Company handles and uses many materials  that  are
classified as hazardous.  The Environmental Protection Agency and similar
local  agencies  have jurisdiction over the handling  and  processing  of
these  materials.   The Company is also subject to the oversight  of  the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration concerning employee  safety
and health matters.  The Company is subject to the Federal Communications
Commission's jurisdiction regarding the use of radio frequencies.

          Federal  law  establishes maximum aircraft noise and  emissions
limits.  At the present time, all of the aircraft operated by the Company
comply  with  all  applicable  federal noise and  emissions  regulations.
Federal law generally preempts airports from imposing unreasonable  local
noise rules that restrict air carrier operations.  However, under certain
circumstances   airport   operators   may   implement   reasonable    and
nondiscriminatory  local  noise abatement  procedures,  which  procedures
could  impact  the  ability  of the Company to  serve  certain  airports,
particularly in off-peak hours.

     Seasonality

           Seasonal factors such as winter snowstorms, thunderstorms, and
hurricanes   have  the  ability  to  affect  the  Company's   departures,
completion  factor, profitability and cash generation.  As a  whole,  the
Company's  principal  geographic areas of operations  usually  experience
more  adverse  weather during the year as compared to other  geographical
regions,  causing  a  greater  percentage  of  the  Company's  and  other
airlines' flights to be canceled.

Item 2.        Properties

     Leased Facilities

          Airports

           The  Company leases gate and ramp facilities at  most  of  the
airports  ACA serves and leases ticket counter and office space at  those
locations  where ticketing is handled by Company personnel.  Payments  to
airport authorities for ground facilities are generally based on a number
of  factors,  including space occupied as well as  flight  and  passenger
volume.  The Company occupies a 69,000 square foot passenger concourse at
Washington-Dulles dedicated solely to regional airline  operations.   The
36-gate  concourse,  designed  to support the  Company's  United  Express
operation, is owned by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority and
leased to the Company under a 15-year lease.

          Corporate Offices

           In  December 2000, the Company moved into a newly built three-
story  office building encompassing 77,000 square feet of space  under  a
ten  year  operating  lease.   This new facility  houses  the  executive,
administrative and system control departments.  The Company's  previously
leased  headquarters facility, comprised of 79,000 square feet, has  been
transformed  into an employee training and services center.  The  Company
renegotiated  this  lease for a new seven-year term expiring  in  January
2008.    Together,  these  two  properties  will  provide  the  necessary
facilities for the Company's continued growth.

          Maintenance Facilities

           The  FAA's safety regulations mandate periodic inspection  and
maintenance  of  commercial  aircraft.  The Company  performs  most  line
maintenance,  service and inspection of its aircraft and engines  at  its
maintenance facilities using its own personnel.

           The  Company  performs maintenance functions  at  its  112,000
square  foot aircraft maintenance facility at Washington-Dulles  airport,
and  at  its  34,000  square foot hangar facility in Columbia,  SC.   The
Washington-Dulles facility is comprised of 60,000 square feet  of  hangar
space  and 52,000 square feet of support space and includes hangar,  shop
and  office space necessary to maintain the Company's fleet.  In addition
to  these  facilities,  the  company performs maintenance  functions  and
maintains  leased hangar space at LaGuardia Airport in  New  York,  Logan
Airport   in  Boston,  O'Hare  International  Airport  in  Chicago,   and
Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport.

Item 3.        Legal Proceedings

           The  Company is a party to routine litigation and to FAA civil
action  proceedings,  all of which are viewed to  be  incidental  to  its
business,  and none of which the Company believes are likely  to  have  a
material effect on the Company's financial position or the results of its
operations.

Item 4.        Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

          No matter was submitted during the fiscal quarter ended
December 31, 2001, to a vote of the security holders of the Company
through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise.

          The Company has not paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock
and  does  not anticipate paying any Common Stock cash dividends  in  the
foreseeable  future.  The Company intends to retain earnings  to  finance
the growth of its operations.  The payment of Common Stock cash dividends
in  the  future will depend upon such factors as earnings levels, capital
requirements, the Company's financial condition, the applicability of any
restrictions  imposed upon the Company subsidiaries  by  certain  of  its
financing  agreements, the dividend restrictions imposed by the Company's
line  of  credit,  and  other factors deemed relevant  by  the  Board  of
Directors.   In  addition,  ACAI  is  a  holding  company  and  its  only
significant asset is its investment in its subsidiary, ACA.

          The  Company's Board of Directors has approved the purchase  of
up  to  $40  million of the Company's outstanding common  stock  in  open
market  or  private transactions.  As of March 1, 2002, the  Company  has
purchased  2,128,000 shares of its common stock at an  average  price  of
$8.64  per  share.  The Company has approximately $21.6 million remaining
of  the $40 million authorization.  The Company did not repurchase shares
of its common stock during fiscal 2001.

Item  7.         Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Results  of
Operations                    and Financial Condition

General

           Atlantic  Coast  Airlines  Holdings,  Inc.  ("ACAI")  operates
through its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic Coast Airlines ("ACA").  In
2001,  the Company recorded net income of $34.3 million compared to $15.2
million for 2000, and $28.3 million for 1999.  The 2001 results include a
restructuring  charge of $13.7 million, net of income taxes,  related  to
the  planned  early  retirement  of nine leased  29-seat  J-41  turboprop
aircraft   and   $5.8  million,  net  of  income  taxes,  in   government
compensation  received  pursuant to the  Air  Transportation  Safety  and
System Stabilization Act ("Stabilization Act") signed by the President of
the  United  States  in  September 2001.   The  2000  results  include  a
restructuring  charge of $17.4 million, net of income taxes,  related  to
the early retirement of 28 leased 19-seat J-32 turboprop aircraft and non-
recurring tax credits of $1.4 million.  The 1999 net results include  the
cumulative  effect  of  an accounting change, net  of  income  taxes,  of
$888,000  related  to the adoption of Statement of Position  98-5,  which
resulted   in  the  write-off  of  remaining  unamortized  regional   jet
implementation  costs.   Excluding these unusual items,  net  income  for
2001,  2000  and 1999 would have been $42.2 million, $31.1  million,  and
$29.2  million,  respectively.  For 2001, the  Company's  available  seat
miles ("ASM") increased 49% with the addition of 19 Canadair Regional Jet
("CRJ") aircraft and 15 Fairchild Dornier 328JET ("328JET") aircraft, net
of  the  reduction of 21 J-32 turboprop aircraft during  the  year.   The
number  of  total  passengers increased 31%, and revenue passenger  miles
("RPM") increased 49%.

Results of Operations

           The  Company's net income was $34.3 million (including a $23.0
million pre-tax operating charge related to the early retirement of  nine
J-41 turboprop aircraft and $9.7 million in pre-tax income for government
compensation) or $.76 per diluted share in 2001 compared to $15.2 million
(including a $29.0 million pre-tax operating charge related to the  early
retirement  of 28 J-32 turboprop aircraft) or $.36 per diluted  share  in
2000,  and $28.3 million or $.66 per diluted share in 1999.  During 2001,
the  Company generated operating income of $44.2 million (including a $23
million  operating charge related to the early retirement  of  nine  J-41
turboprop aircraft), compared to $24.1 million for 2000 (including a  $29
million pre-tax operating charge related to the early retirement of 28 J-
32  turboprop  aircraft)  and  $49.3 million  for  1999.   Excluding  the
aircraft early retirement charges in 2001 and 2000, operating margins for
2001, 2000 and 1999 were 11.5%, 11.7% and 14.2% respectively.

          Results   for   2001   include   special   pre-tax   government
compensation  of  $9.7 million arising from the Stabilization  Act.   The
Stabilization  Act  provides cash grants to commercial  air  carriers  as
compensation for direct and incremental losses resulting from the attacks
of  September  11, 2001 and incurred from that date through December  31,
2001.

           The 83.5% increase in operating income from 2000 to 2001 is  a
reflection of the 49.4% increase in available seat miles coupled  with  a
13.7% decrease in revenue per available seat mile and a 13.3% decrease in
the  cost per available seat mile.  Additionally, the 2001 aircraft early
retirement  charge of $23 million was $6 million less than  the  aircraft
early  retirement  charge in 2000.  Revenue and cost per  available  seat
mile have decreased as the turboprop aircraft are retired and the Company
utilizes more regional jets.

          The  51.1% decrease in operating income from 1999 to 2000 is  a
reflection of the J-32 retirement charge of $29 million.  Excluding  this
charge,  operating income increased 7.7%, which reflects a 5.1%  increase
in  unit  revenue  (total  revenue per ASM) from  $0.195  to  $0.205,  an
increase of 7.7% in unit costs (cost per ASM) from $0.168 to $.181 and  a
23.9% increase in ASM's.

Fiscal Year 2000 vs. 2001

     Operating Revenues

          The  Company's  operating revenues increased  28.9%  to  $583.4
million  in  2001  compared  to $452.5 million  in  2000.   The  increase
resulted primarily from a 49.4% increase in ASMs to 3.3 billion  as  well
as  a  9.9% increase in revenue per departure to $2,452.  Revenue in 2001
was recognized primarily under fee-for-service agreements as compared  to
a  combination  of  a proration-of-fare agreement and  a  fee-for-service
agreement  in  2000.  Revenue for 2001 also included an  additional  $3.8
million attributable to routine subsequent period sampling adjustments to
prior   billed  tickets  under  the  Company's  former  proration-of-fare
arrangement.   The  Company believes that it will  no  longer  experience
revenue   adjustments   attributable  to  its  former   proration-of-fare
arrangements.   The  increase in ASMs reflects the  addition  of  19  CRJ
aircraft and 15 328JET aircraft in 2001, and the full year effect in 2001
of  adding 14 CRJ aircraft and 14 328JET aircraft during 2000, offset  by
the  removal  of  21  J-32  aircraft  during  2001.   Revenue  passengers
increased  30.7%  in  2001  compared to 2000,  which  combined  with  the
increase  in  the  average passenger stage length  resulted  in  a  49.1%
increase in RPMs.

          The 40.8% decrease in other revenues year over year reflects  a
$1.8  million  decrease in revenue from package and mail delivery  and  a
$1.4  million  decrease in United employee ticket revenue.  The  decrease
reflects the fact that these revenues are no longer earned by the Company
as  a  result  of the restatement of the United Express agreement,  which
went into effect on December 1, 2000.

     Operating Expenses

          Excluding  the  $23  million  and $29  million  aircraft  early
retirement charge in 2001 and 2000, respectively, the Company's operating
expenses  increased  29.2% to $516.2 million in 2001 compared  to  $399.4
million in 2000.  This increase was due primarily to: a 52.5% increase in
total  salary  costs,  a  51.1% increase in  aircraft  rentals,  a  57.9%
increase in facility rents and landing fees and a 49.4% increase in ASMs.
These increases reflect the addition of 34 regional jet aircraft in 2001,
and the retirement of 21 J-32s during 2001.

</TABLE>
          Costs per ASM decreased 15.5% to 16.4 cents in 2001 compared to
19.4  cents for 2000.  The main factors contributing to the decrease were
a  49.4%  increase  in  ASMs and a 72.5% decrease in  the  year-over-year
traffic   commissions  and  related  fees.   The  decrease   in   traffic
commissions  and related fees reflects the fact that many of  these  fees
are  no longer borne by the Company as a result of the restatement of the
United  Express  agreement, which went into effect on December  1,  2000.
Excluding  the  aircraft early retirement charge in both 2001  and  2000,
costs per ASM decreased 13.3% to 15.7 cents during 2001 compared to  18.1
cents for 2000.

          Salaries and related costs per ASM increased 2.0% to 5.0  cents
in 2001 compared to 4.9 cents in 2000.  In absolute dollars, salaries and
related  expenses increased 52.5% from $107.8 million in 2000  to  $164.4
million  in 2001.  The increase primarily resulted from the net  addition
of  557  full  and  part time employees during 2001  to  support  the  34
regional  jet  aircraft  added during 2001, an accrual  of  $2.9  million
recorded  in  2001  reflecting  estimated costs  for  additional  company
contributions which may be made to the Company's 401(k) plan  to  address
operational  defects  found in the plan, and $1.8  million  in  executive
compensation related to deferred compensation benefits being provided  to
senior executive officers.

          The  cost  per ASM of aircraft fuel decreased to 2.7  cents  in
2001  compared to 2.9 cents in 2000.  The total average price per  gallon
of  fuel  decreased 11.7% to 98 cents in 2001 compared to $1.11 in  2000.
In  absolute  dollars, aircraft fuel expense increased 37.1%  from  $64.4
million in 2000 to $88.3 million in 2001, reflecting a 27.3% increase  in
block  hours  and  the higher fuel consumption per hour of  regional  jet
aircraft versus turboprop aircraft which resulted in a 21.6% increase  in
the system average burn rate (gallons used per block hour flown).

          The   cost  per  ASM  of  aircraft  maintenance  and  materials
decreased  to  1.5  cents in 2001 compared to  1.7  cents  in  2000.   In
absolute  dollars,  aircraft maintenance and materials expense  increased
31.9% from $36.8 million in 2000 to $48.5 million in 2001.  The increased
expense  resulted from the increase in the size of the total  fleet,  the
continual increase in the average age of the J-41 turboprop fleet and the
gradual expiration of manufacturer's warranties on the CRJs.
<PAGE> 24
          The  cost per ASM of aircraft rentals remained the same at  2.7
cents  in  2001  and 2000. During 2001, the Company took delivery  of  34
additional  regional jet aircraft, all of which were lease financed.   In
absolute  dollars,  aircraft  rental expense  increased  51.1%  to  $90.3
million  as  compared  to $59.8 million in 2000  due  to  the  additional
regional jet aircraft added to the fleet.

          The  cost  per  ASM  of traffic commissions  and  related  fees
decreased  to  .5  cents in 2001 as compared to 2.6 cents  in  2000.   In
absolute dollars, traffic commissions and related fees decreased 72.5% to
$15.6  million in 2001 from $56.6 million in 2000. The decrease  reflects
the fact that many of these fees are no longer borne by the Company as  a
result  of  the restatement of the United Express agreement,  which  went
into  effect  on  December  1, 2000.  Under the restated  agreement,  the
Company  is  now  only  responsible for fees associated  with  the  major
airline Computer Reservation Systems.

          The cost per ASM of facility rent and landing fees increased to
1.0 cents for 2001 from .9 cents for 2000.  In absolute dollars, facility
rent  and landing fees increased 57.9% to $32 million for 2001 from $20.3
million in 2000.  The increase in absolute dollars for facility rent  and
landing  fees  is  a  result  of  an 18.5%  increase  in  the  number  of
departures, the heavier landing weight of the regional jets and the lease
of  the  Company's  new  corporate headquarters  building  commencing  on
December 1, 2000.

          The  cost  per  ASM of depreciation and amortization  decreased
slightly  to  0.4  cents for 2001 from 0.5 cents in  2000.   In  absolute
dollars,  depreciation and amortization expense for 2001 increased  37.2%
to  $15.4  million  from  $11.2 million in 2000.  The  absolute  increase
results  in  part from additional expenditures for rotable  spare  parts,
engines and aircraft improvements.

          The  cost per ASM of other operating expenses remained the same
at  1.9  cents  for 2001 and 2000.  In absolute dollars, other  operating
expenses  increased 45% to $61.7 million for 2001 from $42.5  million  in
2000.   The increased costs result primarily from a 200% increase in  the
cost  of  passenger  insurance, a 96.4% increase  in  the  cost  of  hull
insurance, and the 30.7% increase in revenue passengers which resulted in
higher passenger handling costs, training expenses and crew accommodation
costs  for  new flight crews to support additional aircraft and stations.
The  Company  expects  pilot  training and crew  accommodation  costs  to
continue  to  increase  as  the remaining firm  ordered  CRJ  and  328JET
aircraft  are  received.  Under  the Stabilization  Act,  the  government
subsequently  authorized  air  carriers to apply  for  reimbursement  for
increased insurance costs incurred during the period October 1,  2001  to
October 30, 2001, and the Company applied for, received, and recorded  as
a  reduction to insurance expense $652,000 in such reimbursements.   This
amount  was  based  on  costs incurred during the period,  and  no  other
insurance reimbursements are anticipated.

          In  2001, the Company recorded an operating charge of 0.7 cents
per  ASM  for  costs associated with the early retirement  of  nine  J-41
turboprop  aircraft, as compared to 1.3 cents per ASM in 2000  for  costs
associated  with the early retirement of 28 J-32 turboprop aircraft.   In
absolute  dollars,  the  amount of the charge was  $23  million  in  2001
compared to $29 million in 2000.    The retirement of the J-32 fleet  was
completed by December 31, 2001 and the Company reversed $500,000  of  the
2000  charge.   Nine of the J-41 turboprop aircraft are  expected  to  be
retired in 2002, with the remaining 22 aircraft to be retired by December
31, 2003.
<PAGE> 25
     Other Income (Expense)

          Interest  expense decreased from $6 million  in  2000  to  $4.8
million  in 2001. The decrease is the result of the full year  effect  of
the impact of the conversion of the Company's 7% notes into equity during
the first half of 2000.

          Interest  income  increased from $5 million  in  2000  to  $7.5
million  in  2001.   This  is  primarily  the  result  of  the  Company's
significantly higher cash balances during 2001 as compared to 2000 offset
partially by lower rate of return on short-term investments in 2001.

          On  September  22,  2001, President Bush signed  into  law  the
Stabilization  Act.   The  Stabilization  Act  provides  cash  grants  to
commercial  air  carriers as compensation for (1) direct losses  incurred
beginning with the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 as a result of
any   FAA  mandated  ground  stop  order  issued  by  the  Secretary   of
Transportation  (and for any subsequent order which continues  or  renews
such  a  stoppage), and (2) incremental losses incurred during the period
beginning  September 11, 2001 and ending December 31, 2001  as  a  direct
result  of such attacks.  The Company is entitled to receive cash  grants
under  these  provisions.  The exact amount of the Company's compensation
will  be  based  on the lesser of actual losses incurred or  a  statutory
limit  based on the total amount allocable to all airlines.   This  total
amount is not yet determinable because the statutory limit is subject  to
information not yet released by the government.  The Company has received
$9.7  million  in  government compensation,  which  is  the  government's
estimate  of  approximately  85%  of the Company's  allocation  based  on
preliminary  data.  The Company has received $9.7 million in cash  grants
under   these   provisions  recognized  as  non-operating  income   under
"government compensation" for the third and fourth quarters  2001.   This
amount  was the government's estimate of approximately 85% of amount  due
to  the  Company  based on preliminary data.  The  exact  amount  of  the
Company's  compensation  will be based on the  lesser  of  actual  losses
incurred or a statutory limit based on the total amount allocable to  all
airlines.   This  exact  amount  is  not  yet  determinable  because  the
statutory limit is subject to information not yet released by the federal
government.  As such, the Company is unsure if it will be entitled to any
further government compensation under this program and will recognize any
remaining  payments  as  non-operating income during  the  period  it  is
determined  the  Company  is  entitled to such  amounts.     All  amounts
received  as government compensation are subject to audit and  adjustment
by the federal government.

          The  Company  recorded a provision for income  taxes  of  $22.5
million  for  2001,  compared to a provision for  income  taxes  of  $7.7
million in 2000.  The 2001 effective tax rate was approximately 39.6%  as
compared  to  the 2000 effective tax rate of approximately  33.6%.   This
increase is primarily due to a favorable state income tax ruling in  2000
resulting  in  the  application of one time state tax  credits,  and  the
realization of certain tax benefits that were previously reserved,  which
together  reduced  income tax expense by approximately $1.4  million  for
2000.    The   effective  tax  rates  reflect  non-deductible   permanent
differences between taxable and book income.

Fiscal Year 1999 vs. 2000

     Operating Revenues

          The  Company's  operating revenues increased  30.3%  to  $452.5
million  in  2000  compared  to $347.4 million  in  1999.   The  increase
resulted  from  a 23.9% increase in ASMs, together with  an  increase  in
revenue per ASMs of 5.1%.  The increase in ASMs reflects the addition  of
fourteen CRJ aircraft and fourteen 328JET aircraft in 2000, and the  full
year effect in 2000 of adding ten CRJ aircraft during 1999, offset by the
removal of seven J-32 aircraft during 2000.  Revenue passengers increased
16.8%  in 2000 compared to 1999, which combined with the increase in  the
average passenger stage length resulted in a 23% increase in RPMs.

          The  86%  increase  in other revenues year over  year  includes
amounts paid by Delta Air Lines related to certain pilot training for the
Delta Connection operation.

     Operating Expenses

          Excluding  the $29.0 million aircraft early retirement  charge,
the  Company's  operating expenses increased 34.0% to $399.4  million  in
2000 compared to $298.1 million in 1999.  This increase was due primarily
to: an 89% increase in total fuel costs as a result of a 49% increase  in
the average price per gallon of jet fuel, coupled with a 20% increase  in
the  average fuel burn rate to 222 gallons per hour; a 23.9% increase  in
ASMs;  and  expenses  for the certification and start  up  of  the  ACJet
operation.  The increase in ASMs, passengers and burn rates reflects  the
addition  of  fourteen CRJs and fourteen 328JETs into scheduled  service,
net of the retirement of seven J-32s during 2000.

          A  summary  of operating expenses as a percentage of  operating
revenue and operating cost per ASM for the years ended December 31,  1999
and 2000 is as follows:

</TABLE>
          Costs per ASM increased 15.5% to 19.4 cents in 2000 compared to
16.8  cents for 1999.  The main factors contributing to the increase were
a  49%  increase in the year over year price per gallon of jet fuel,  the
expenses associated with the certification and start-up of ACJet,  flight
crew training costs, and the aircraft early retirement charge.  Excluding
the  aircraft  early retirement charge, costs per ASM increased  7.7%  to
18.1 cents during 2000 compared to 16.8 cents for 1999.
<PAGE> 27
          Salaries and related costs per ASM increased 2.1% to 4.9  cents
in 2000 compared to 4.8 cents in 1999.  In absolute dollars, salaries and
related  expenses increased 27.5% from $84.6 million in  1999  to  $107.8
million  in 2000.  The increase primarily resulted from the net  addition
of  780  full  and  part time employees during 2000  to  support  the  28
regional jet aircraft added during 2000.

          The  cost  per ASM of aircraft fuel increased to 2.9  cents  in
2000  compared to 1.9 cents in 1999.  The total price per gallon of  fuel
increased  48.9%  to $1.11 in 2000 compared to 74.6 cents  in  1999.   In
absolute  dollars,  aircraft  fuel expense  increased  89.1%  from  $34.1
million in 1999 to $64.4 million in 2000, reflecting the higher cost  per
gallon  fuel  price, a 5.8% increase in block hours and the  higher  fuel
consumption per hour of regional jet aircraft versus a turboprop aircraft
which resulted in a 20% increase in the system average burn rate (gallons
used per block hour flown).

          The   cost  per  ASM  of  aircraft  maintenance  and  materials
increased  to  1.7  cents in 2000 compared to  1.4  cents  in  1999.   In
absolute  dollars,  aircraft maintenance and materials expense  increased
50.9% from $24.4 million in 1999 to $36.8 million in 2000.  The increased
expense  resulted from the increase in the size of the total  fleet,  the
continual  increase  in  the  average age of the  turboprop  fleets,  the
gradual  expiration of manufacturer's warranties on  the  CRJs,  and  the
reversal  in  1999  of approximately $1.5 million in life  limited  parts
repair  expense  accruals  related to CRJ engines  that  were  no  longer
required based on the introduction of a maintenance contract covering the
GE engines operating on the CRJ fleet.

          The  cost per ASM of aircraft rentals increased slightly to 2.7
cents  in  2000 compared to 2.5 cents in 1999.  During 2000, the  Company
took  delivery of 28 additional regional jet aircraft, all of which  were
lease  financed.  In absolute dollars, aircraft rental expense  increased
32.2%  to $59.8 million as compared to $45.2 million in 1999 due  to  the
additional aircraft added to the fleet.

          The  cost  per  ASM  of traffic commissions  and  related  fees
decreased to 2.6 cents in 2000 as compared to 3.1 cents in 1999.    Delta
is  responsible  for  travel  agent  commissions  and  related  fees  and
effective  December  1,  2000,  United is responsible  for  travel  agent
commissions  and  program  fee expense as a result  of  the  restated  UA
agreement.   In  absolute dollars, traffic commissions and  related  fees
increased 3.9% to $56.6 million in 2000 from $54.5 million in 1999.   The
increase  resulted from an increase in passenger revenues  and  passenger
volumes, offset by a reduction in the commission rates payable to  travel
agents.

          The  cost  per ASM of facility rents and landing fees decreased
to  .9  cents  for  2000  from 1.0 cent for 1999.  In  absolute  dollars,
facility rent and landing fees increased 13.5% to $20.3 million for  2000
from  $17.9  million  in  1999.  The increase  in  absolute  dollars  for
facility  rent  and landing fees is a result of a 6.7%  increase  in  the
number  of  departures, and the heavier landing weight  of  the  regional
jets.

          The  cost per ASM of depreciation and amortization remained the
same  at  0.5 cents for 2000 and 1999.  In absolute dollars, depreciation
and  amortization expense for 2000 increased 24.1% to $11.2 million  from
$9  million in 1999.  The absolute increase results in part from the full
year  effect  of purchasing two CRJ aircraft and rotable spare  parts  in
1999 for approximately $59 million.
<PAGE> 28
          The  cost per ASM of other operating expenses increased to  1.9
cents  for  2000  from  1.6  cents in 1999.  In absolute  dollars,  other
operating  expenses increased 49.5% to $42.5 million for 2000 from  $28.5
million  in  1999.  The increased costs result primarily from  the  16.8%
increase  in  revenue  passengers  which  resulted  in  higher  passenger
handling costs, training expenses for new flight crews, and expenses  for
ACJet pre-operating activities.

          In  2000, the Company recorded an operating charge of 1.3 cents
per  ASM  for  costs  associated with the early  retirement  of  28  J-32
turboprop  aircraft.  In absolute dollars, the amount of the  charge  was
$29  million.  The  charge  included the estimated  cost  of  contractual
obligations  to  meet  aircraft return conditions  as  well  as  a  lease
termination  fee.   The  retirement of the J-32 fleet  was  completed  on
December 31, 2001.

          Other Income (Expense)

          Interest  expense increased from $5.6 million  in  1999  to  $6
million  in 2000. The increase is the result of the full year  effect  of
the  debt  outstanding  for the purchase of two CRJs  in  1999  partially
offset  by  the impact of the conversion of the Company's 7%  notes  into
equity during the first half of 2000.

          Interest  income  increased from $3.9 million  in  1999  to  $5
million  in  2000.   This  is  primarily  the  result  of  the  Company's
significantly higher cash balances during 2000 as compared to 1999.

          The  Company  recorded  a provision for income  taxes  of  $7.7
million  for  2000,  compared to a provision for income  taxes  of  $18.3
million  in 1999.  The 2000 effective tax rate is approximately 33.6%  as
compared  to  the  1999 effective tax rate of approximately  38.6%.  This
decrease is due to a favorable state income tax ruling resulting  in  the
application of one time state tax credits, and the realization of certain
tax benefits that were previously reserved, which together reduced income
tax  expense  by approximately $1.4 million for 2000.  The effective  tax
rates  reflect non-deductible permanent differences between  taxable  and
book income.

          The  American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  issued
Statement  of  Position 98-5 on accounting for start-up costs,  including
preoperating  costs  related to the introduction of new  fleet  types  by
airlines.   The new accounting guidelines were effective for  1999.   The
Company  had  previously deferred certain start-up costs related  to  the
introduction of the CRJs and was amortizing such costs to expense ratably
over  four  years.   Effective January 1, 1999, the  Company  recorded  a
charge  for the remaining unamortized balance of approximately  $888,000,
net  of  $598,000  of  income taxes, associated with previously  deferred
preoperating costs.

successfully   retire  turboprop  aircraft;  flight   reallocations   and
potential service disruptions due to labor actions by employees of  Delta
Air  Lines  or United Airlines; general economic and industry conditions;
and  additional  acts of war.  The statements in this Annual  Report  are
made  as  of  March 29, 2002 and the Company undertakes no obligation  to
update  any of the forward-looking information included in this  release,
whether  as  a  result  of  new information, future  events,  changes  in
expectations or otherwise.

          The  events of September 11, together with the slowing  economy
throughout  2001, have significantly affected the U.S. airline  industry.
These events have resulted in changed government regulation, declines and
shifts  in  passenger  demand, increased insurance  costs  and  tightened
credit  markets  which  continue to affect the operations  and  financial
condition  of  participants  in the industry  including  the Company, its
code share partners, and aircraft manufactures. These circumstances  have
raised  substantial  risks and  uncertainties, including  those discussed
 below,  which  may impact the  Company, its  code  share  partners,  and
aircraft manufacturers, in ways that the Company is not currently able to
predict.

          The Company provides service for its Delta Connection operations
exclusively with regional jets and is  continuing its  transformation of
its existing United Express  operation to an all regional jet fleet.   In
addition  to the 60 CRJs and 33 328JETs in service as of March  1,  2002,
the  Company  has  firm orders for an additional 36 CRJs from  Bombardier
Inc.  and  32 328JETs from Fairchild Dornier, with option orders  for  80
CRJs  and 81 328JETs, and long-term marketing agreements with United  and
Delta  to  fly the firm ordered jet aircraft in United Express and  Delta
Connection service.  Under these agreements, the Company is dependent  on
United  and Delta for substantially all of its revenue and for  providing
support  services necessary to operate its aircraft, and is dependent  on
Bombardier  and Fairchild for providing aircraft expected to support  the
Company's future growth and for other support described in this report on
Form  10-K.  Business or operational difficulties, liquidity problems  or
bankruptcy of any of these entities could materially impact the Company's
operations and financial condition.

          The  slowing  economy  in  2001 and the  terrorist  attacks  of
September  11  have resulted in both United and Delta  changing  how  the
Company's regional jet aircraft are utilized.  In the past, regional jets
were primarily deployed to open new long, thin routes and to replace some
turboprop  service in higher traffic markets.  With the fleet  reductions
of  older,  higher  cost narrow body aircraft by United  and  Delta,  the
Company has been replacing mainline service to select United markets from
Chicago  and  added  mainline complementary  service  on  numerous  other
routes.  For Delta, the Company is currently operating hubs at New York's
LaGuardia  airport, Boston's Logan airport, and Cincinnati  and  Northern
Kentucky International Airport.

          UAL  Corporation,  the  parent of United,  has  disclosed  that
during the fourth quarter 2001 it began implementing a financial recovery
plan  that  includes four planks:  reducing the size of the  airline  and
cutting  capital  and  operating spending in line  with  that  reduction,
generating as much revenue as possible from each flight, working with its
unions  and  other  employee  groups to find further  labor  savings  and
implementing a financing plan to support it through the execution of  its
financial  recovery  plan.  UAL Corporation further  disclosed  that  the
impact  of the events of September 11, 2001 on United and the sufficiency
of  its  financial  resources to absorb that impact are  dependent  on  a
number  of  factors,  including  United's  success  in  implementing  its
financial recovery plan.

          Following  September  11,  United requested  that  the  Company
propose  measures  that  it could take to assist  in  improving  United's
financial  situation.  The Company believes that United  made  a  similar
request  to  other  suppliers and vendors.  On  December  31,  2001,  the
Company  and  United  agreed on fee-per-departure rates  to  be  utilized
during 2002.  In addition, in the context of reaching this agreement, the
Company  agreed to certain concessions that would benefit United  by  (1)
settling various existing contract issues, (2) agreeing that United would
not  have  to pay increased rates to reflect utilization changes  in  the
fourth  quarter  of  2001,  (3)  agreeing  to  2002  rates  that  require
aggressive cost containment, and (4) reaffirming its commitment to retire
the Company's J-41 turboprop aircraft.  The Company determined that these
concessions,  which  were  favorable  to  United  as  compared  to  prior
contractual  arrangements  and were designed  to  assist  United  in  its
financial  recovery plan, were appropriate in light of the  circumstances
at the time.

          In  late  March  2002,  United informed  the  Company  that  an
essential  component  of its financial recovery plan  includes  obtaining
cost  reductions  from its employees, suppliers and  partners,  and  that
United  is seeking the Company's assistance in decreasing the cost of the
Company's product and achieving cash flow improvements for United over the
next 24 months.  The  Company  has  commenced  discussions  with United
regarding opportunities  for  reducing its costs or creating  value to
address United's financial situation.  The basis  for,  nature,  timing
and extent of any such actions has  not  been agreed.   While the Company
has expressed its willingness  to  work  with United  to  find  mutually
acceptable opportunities, the Company  believes that it is not
contractually obligated to make any such changes under the United
Express  Agreements  or  the  December  31,  2001  rate  setting
agreement.

          The   Company's  Delta  Connection  service  commenced  revenue
service  with  328JETs during the third quarter of 2000  and  added  CRJs
during  the fourth quarter of 2000.  Approximately $7.8 million in start-
up  expenses from inception through commencement of revenue service  were
incurred,  which  were expensed as incurred.  Delta  is  reimbursing  the
Company  for  $5.2  million of these costs, and  the  amounts  are  being
recorded  as revenue ratably through July 2003.  As of December 31,  2001
the Company has recorded $2.0 million of this revenue.
<PAGE> 31
          The  chairman  of  Fairchild Dornier, the manufacturer  of  the
328JET,  recently stated that it has an immediate and critical  need  for
additional funding, and that it is in discussions with several  potential
strategic partners regarding proposed investments.  The Company is unable
to  predict  whether  Fairchild Dornier will  be  successful  in  finding
additional  capital  or  in  otherwise restructuring  its  finances,  but
believes  that  Fairchild  Dornier  may  be  forced  to  seek  bankruptcy
protection  if  it is unsuccessful in its efforts.  In  the  event  of  a
Fairchild  Dornier  bankruptcy,  Fairchild  Dornier  could  either  sell,
liquidate  or reorganize some or all of its businesses, and in the  event
of  a  reorganization or sale of its businesses would have the  right  to
assume  or  reject  future  contractual  obligations.   Should  Fairchild
Dornier  be unable to deliver ordered 328JETS, the Company would reassess
available alternatives in pursuing its growth strategy and possibly delay
the   Company's  turboprop  retirement  plans,  and  adjust  other  plans
discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K relating to its 328JET aircraft.

          Fairchild  Dornier  has significant future obligations  to  the
Company  in connection with the order of 328JET aircraft.  These  include
obligations:  to deliver 32 firm ordered 328JETs and 81 additional option
328JETs with certain financing support; to pay the Company any difference
between the lease payments, if any, received from the remarketing the  of
26  J-41 aircraft leased by the Company and the lease payment obligations
of the Company on those aircraft; to purchase five J-41 aircraft owned by
the Company at their net book value at the time of retirement;  to assume
certain   crew   training  costs;  and,  to  provide  spares,   warranty,
engineering,  and  related support.  Fairchild Dornier  has  delayed  the
delivery of one 328JET that was scheduled to be delivered to the  Company
during  the  week  of  March  25, 2002 for  reasons  connected  with  its
financing.   The  Company  believes it has secured  rights  to  Fairchild
Dornier's  equity interest in the delivered 328JETs that it  may  proceed
against  in the event that Fairchild Dornier fails to fulfill certain  of
these obligations.

          During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a  pre-
tax  aircraft  early  retirement charge of $23.5 million  for  the  early
retirement  of  nine  leased Jetstream-41 turboprop aircraft,  which  the
Company plans to remove from service prior to year-end 2002.  The Company
anticipates taking additional charges during 2002 of approximately  $48.0
million  pre-tax for the retirement of its remaining 29-seat Jetstream-41
turboprop aircraft.  The undiscounted remaining lease obligations (net of
the  Company's estimate of the future sublease rentals) on the J-41 fleet
after  planned  retirement dates in 2002 and 2003 are  approximately  $55
million and continue through 2010 and the book value of the five owned J-
41  aircraft  as of March 1, 2002 is $18.1 million.  To the  extent  that
Fairchild  Dornier fulfills its contractual obligations, the majority  of
the  aircraft  early  retirement charge will  not  adversely  affect  the
Company's  cash  position, with the payments by Fairchild  Dornier  being
recorded as an aircraft purchase inducement on the 328JET aircraft.   The
Company  would remain liable for the  lease payments on its J-41 aircraft
and thus be required to pay the remaining lease payments if, and to the
extent that, Fairchild Dornier were to default on its obligation.

          As  of December 31, 2001, the Company has received $9.7 million
in   cash   grants  under  the  loss  compensation  provisions   of   the
Stabilization  Act,  which amount was recognized as non-operating  income
under "government compensation" in its financial results for 2001.   This
amount  was the government's estimate of approximately 85% of amount  due
to  the  Company  based on preliminary data.  The  exact  amount  of  the
Company's  compensation  will be based on the  lesser  of  actual  losses
incurred or a statutory limit based on the total amount allocable to  all
airlines.   This  exact  amount  is  not  yet  determinable  because  the
statutory limit is subject to information not yet released by the federal
government.  As such, the Company is unsure if it will be entitled to any
further government compensation under this program and will recognize any
remaining  payments  as  non-operating income during  the  period  it  is
determined  the  Company  is  entitled to such  amounts.     All  amounts
received  as government compensation are subject to audit and  adjustment
by the federal government.
<PAGE> 32
          In   addition   to  the  compensation  described   above,   the
Stabilization  Act, among other things, provides U.S. air  carriers  with
the  option  to  purchase certain war risk liability insurance  from  the
United  States  government on an interim basis at  rates  that  are  more
favorable  than  those available from the private market; authorizes  the
federal  government to reimburse air carriers for the increased  cost  of
war risk insurance premiums for a limited but undetermined period of time
as  a  result  of  the  terrorist attacks of  September  11,  2001;  and,
authorizes  the  federal  government, pursuant  to  new  regulations,  to
provide  loan guarantees to air carriers  in  the  aggregate   amount  of
$10 billion.  Since September 11, the Company has purchased hull war risk
coverage through the private insurance market through September 24, 2002,
and  has  purchased liability war risk coverage from the U.S.  government
through  May  19, 2002 and anticipates renewing the government  insurance
for  as  long  as the coverage is available.  The government subsequently
authorized   air   carriers   to  apply  for  reimbursement   under   the
Stabilization  Act  for  increased insurance costs  incurred  during  the
period October 1, 2001 to October 30, 2001, and the Company applied  for,
received,  and recorded as a reduction in insurance expense, $652,000  in
such  reimbursements.  The airlines and insurance industry, together with
the  United States and other governments, are continuing to evaluate both
the  cost  and  options  for providing coverage  of  aviation  insurance.
Recently, an industry-led group announced a proposal to create  a  mutual
insurance company, to be called Equitime, to cover war risk and terrorism
risk,  which  would initially seek support through government guarantees.
Equitime  would  provide  a competitive alternative  to  insurance  being
offered   by  the  traditional  insurance  market,  which  opposes   this
initiative.   Equitime's organizers project that it may be  available  to
provide  insurance as early as May 2002 to up to 70 U.S.  carriers.   The
Company  has not been actively involved in the formation of Equitime  and
is  unable  to anticipate whether this source of insurance will  be  made
available  and,  if  so,  whether it will offer competitive  rates.   The
Company  anticipates that it will follow industry practices with  respect
to sources of insurance.

          The  Company  continues to evaluate the  terms  and  conditions
being  imposed by the government with respect to federal loan guarantees,
and  has  not  yet determined whether to make application  for  any  such
facility.

          Collective  bargaining  agreements  are  negotiated  under  the
Railway  Labor  Act, which governs labor relations in the  transportation
industry, and typically do not contain an expiration date.  Instead, they
specify  a  date  called the amendable date, by which  either  party  may
notify the other of its desire to amend the agreement.  Upon reaching the
amendable  date, the contract is considered "open for amendment."   Prior
to   the   amendable  date,  neither  party  is  required  to  agree   to
modifications   to  the  bargaining  agreement.   Nevertheless,   nothing
prevents the parties from agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the
agreement  in advance of the amendable date.  Contracts remain in  effect
while new agreements are negotiated.  During the negotiating period, both
the Company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the status
quo.

          ACA's collective bargaining agreement with AFA was ratified  in
October  1998.   The  agreement is for a four-year duration  and  becomes
amendable  in October 2002.  This agreement covers all flight  attendants
working  for the Company.  The collective bargaining agreement with  AMFA
was ratified in June 1998.  The agreement is for a four-year duration and
becomes  amendable  in June 2002.   This agreement  covers  all  aviation
maintenance  technicians and ground service equipment  mechanics  working
for  the  Company.  Although there can be no assurances as to the outcome
of  these  negotiations,  the Company anticipates  being  able  to  reach
agreement  with  both unions on mutually satisfactory contracts  with  no
material effect on its results of operations or financial position.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

          As   of   December  31,  2001,  the  Company  had  cash,   cash
equivalents,  and  short-term investments of  $181  million  and  working
capital  of  $138.7 million compared to $121.2 million and  $72  million,
respectively,  as of December 31, 2000.  During the year  ended  December
31,  2001,  cash and cash equivalents increased $87.6 million, reflecting
net  cash provided by operating activities of $88 million, net cash  used
in  investing  activities  of  $5.7 million  (primarily  the  results  of
increased purchases of property and equipment of $34.9 million offset  by
the  net  reduction in short term investments of $27.8 million)  and  net
cash provided by financing activities of $5.2 million.  Net cash provided
by  financing activities was mainly related to proceeds from exercise  of
stock options.

          As   of   December  31,  2000,  the  Company  had  cash,   cash
equivalents,  and  short-term investments of $121.2 million  and  working
capital  of  $72  million compared to $57.4 million  and  $60.4  million,
respectively,  as of December 31, 1999.  During the year  ended  December
31,  2000,  cash and cash equivalents increased $46.2 million, reflecting
net cash provided by operating activities of $93.9 million, net cash used
in  investing  activities of $43.8 million (related to aircraft  purchase
deposits, purchases of aircraft and equipment and increases in short term
investments)  and net cash used in financing activities of $3.9  million.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to
the  restated  UA Agreements, effective December 1, 2000,  in  which  the
Company is now paid weekly in advance for monthly revenue as compared  to
receiving  monthly revenue 30 to 60 days after the end of a  month.   Net
cash used in financing activities was mainly related to payments of long-
term debt and capital lease obligations and purchases of treasury stock.

     Capital Commitments
          The  Company's  business is very capital  intensive,  requiring
significant  amounts  of  capital  to fund  the  acquisition  of  assets,
particularly   aircraft.   The  Company  has  historically   funded   the
acquisition of its aircraft by entering into off-balance sheet  financing
arrangements  known as leveraged leases, in which third  parties  provide
equity  and  debt  financing to purchase the aircraft and  simultaneously
enter  into  long-term agreements to lease the aircraft to  the  Company.
Similarly, the Company often enters into long-term lease commitments with
airports  to  ensure  access to terminal, cargo,  maintenance  and  other
similar  facilities.   As can be seen in the table  below  setting  forth
information  as  of December 31, 2001, these operating lease  commitments
are significant.

these  items.   The  Company  also  has  a  variety  of  other  long-term
contractual  commitments  that  are of a nature  that,  under  accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States, are not required  to
be  reflected on the Company's balance sheet, and that are not  generally
viewed as "off-balance sheet financing arrangements," such as commitments
for major overhaul maintenance on the Company's aircraft.  See "Liquidity

          The   Company  believes  that,  in  the  absence   of   unusual
circumstances,  its cash flow from operations, the expected  availability
of  operating  lease  financing, and other available equipment  financing
will  be sufficient to meet its working capital needs, expected operating
lease  financing  commitments, aircraft acquisitions  and  other  capital
expenditures, and debt service requirements for the next twelve months.

     Other Financing

           On September 28, 2001, the Company entered into an asset-based
lending  agreement with a financial institution that provided the Company
with  a  line of credit for up to $25 million.  The new line  of  credit,
which  will  expire on October 15, 2003, replaced a previous $35  million
line  of  credit.  The interest rate on this line is LIBOR plus .875%  to
1.375%  depending on the Company's fixed charges coverage ratio.   As  of
December 31, 2001, the Company's interest rate on its line of credit  was
3.0%.   The  Company has pledged $15.3 million of this line of credit  as
collateral  for letters of credit issued on behalf of the  Company  by  a
financial institution.  The available borrowing under the line of  credit
is  limited  to  the value of the bond letter of credit on the  Company's
Dulles, Virginia hangar facility plus the value of 60% of the book  value
of  certain rotable spare parts.  As of December 31, 2001 the  amount  of
available  credit under the line was $9.7 million.  As  of  December  31,
2001  there  were  no outstanding borrowings on the $25 million  line  of
credit.

           In  September 1997, approximately $112 million of pass through
certificates were issued in a private placement by separate pass  through
trusts,   which  purchased  with  the  proceeds,  equipment  notes   (the
"Equipment  Notes")  issued  in  connection  with  (i)  leveraged   lease
transactions  relating  to four J-41s and six CRJs,  all  of  which  were
leased to the Company (the "Leased Aircraft"), and (ii) the financing  of
four  J-41s  owned by the Company (the "Owned Aircraft").  The  Equipment
Notes issued with respect to the Owned Aircraft are direct obligations of
ACA,  guaranteed  by  ACAI and are included as debt  obligations  in  the
accompanying  consolidated financial statements and in the  table  above.
The  Equipment Notes issued with respect to the Leased Aircraft  are  not
obligations of ACA or guaranteed by ACAI.

     Aircraft

          The Company has significant lease obligations for aircraft that
are  classified  as operating leases and therefore are not  reflected  as
liabilities on the Company's balance sheet.  The remaining terms of  such
leases range from one to sixteen and three quarters years.  The Company's
total  rent  expense in 2001 under all non-cancelable aircraft  operating
leases  was  approximately $90.3 million.  As of December 31,  2001,  the
Company's  minimum  annual  rental  payments  for  2002  under  all  non-
cancelable  aircraft operating leases with remaining terms of  more  than
one  year  were approximately $120.9 million.  In order to  minimize  the
total  aircraft  rental  expense over the  entire  life  of  the  related
aircraft  leveraged lease transactions, the Company has uneven semiannual
lease  payment  dates  of January 1 and July 1 for  its  CRJ  and  328JET
aircraft.   Currently, approximately 56.7% of the Company's annual  lease
payments for its CRJ and 328JET aircraft are due in January and 28.4% are
due  in  July.   The Company made lease payments for its CRJ  and  328JET
aircraft totaling $59.9 million on January 2, 2002.
<PAGE> 35
          As  of  March 1, 2002, the Company had a total of  36  CRJs  on
order  from  Bombardier, Inc., and held options for 80  additional  CRJs.
The  Company also has a firm order with Fairchild Dornier for  32  328JET
aircraft, and options for 81 additional 328JETs.  Of the 68 firm  ordered
aircraft  deliveries, 26 are scheduled for the remainder of 2002  and  42
are  scheduled for 2003.  The addition of the firm ordered regional jets,
net  of  the removal from service of all of the turboprop aircraft,  will
allow the Company to grow capacity as measured in ASM's, based on planned
aircraft delivery dates, by approximately 34% in 2002 and 25% in 2003. As
of March 2002, the Company's ASM capacity was split 82% in United Express
service and 18% in Delta Connection service.  The Company is obligated to
purchase  and  finance (including leveraged leases) the 68  firm  ordered
aircraft  at  an approximate capital cost of $1.1 billion.   The  Company
anticipates  leasing  all of its year 2002 aircraft deliveries  on  terms
similar to previously delivered regional jet aircraft, except that  three
328JETs  to be utilized for charter operations will be purchased  by  the
Company.   One  of these, which has already been acquired, was  purchased
through  the  application  of  certain deposits  previously  placed  with
Fairchild  Dornier,  and the others will be financed through  debt,  with
repayment  over approximately ten years.  Aircraft orders are subject  to
price  escalation formulas based on certain indices designed  to  reflect
increased costs in the production of the aircraft.  During 2001 the  rate
of  escalation increased, and such increases will be reflected in  future
aircraft cost or lease rates.  During the first quarter of 2002, the rate
of escalation has remained constant.

          The  Company has financed its aircraft through leveraged  lease
transactions, which include requiring equity and debt investors for  each
aircraft.   For  the  CRJs, the Company has firm commitments  for  equity
financing for 19 future aircraft and for debt financing for one aircraft,
and  anticipates finalizing arrangements with Canada's export development
agency  during the second quarter 2002 for debt financing  for  at  least
nine  additional  aircraft.   For  the  328JETs,  the  manufacturer   has
committed to find debt financing for all undelivered aircraft, to provide
equity financing for the next 8 aircraft and to find equity financing for
the remaining undelivered aircraft (for recent developments regarding
Fairchild Dornier, see Outlook).   From  time  to time  the Company seeks
investors  to  participate in its leveraged leases, with  equity  sources
normally  consisting of domestic banks and industrial  credit  investors,
and  debt  sources including export credit agencies and  European  banks.
Commitments  are normally sought during the first and second  quarter  of
each  year for funding for aircraft to be delivered throughout the  year.
Following  the  terrorist attacks, it has been the  Company's  experience
that  sources of funding have decreased and the cost of available funding
has  increased.  The Company believes that it will able to  find  funding
for  its  future  lease requirements, but the outcome, and  the  cost  of
funds,  is  subject  to market conditions in a volatile  lease  financing
market.

     Capital Equipment and Debt Service

            In   2002   the  Company  anticipates  capital  spending   of
approximately  $56 million consisting of approximately  $30  million  for
aircraft,  $15.5  million  for  rotable spare  parts,  $4.8  million  for
equipment,  and  $5.7 million for other capital assets,  and  expects  to
finance these capital expenditures out of working capital.

           Principal payments on long term debt for 2002 are estimated to
be  approximately  $4.6  million reflecting  borrowings  related  to  the
purchase  of four CRJs acquired in 1998 and 1999 and five J-41s  acquired
in  1997 and 1998.  The foregoing amount does not include additional debt
that  may be required for the financing of new CRJs, 328JETs, spare parts
and spare engines.
 <PAGE> 36
     Other Commitments

          The  Company's regional jet fleet is comprised of new  aircraft
with  an  average age of less than two years.   Since maintenance expense
on  new  aircraft  is  lower  in the early  years  of  operation  due  to
manufacturers' warranties and the generally lower failure rates of  major
components,  the Company's maintenance expense for regional jet  aircraft
will increase in future periods.

          In  2000,  the  Company executed a seven-year  engine  services
agreement with GE Engine Services, Inc. ("GE") covering the scheduled and
unscheduled  repair of ACA's CRJ jet engines, operated  on  the  43  CRJs
already  delivered  or on order for the United Express  operation.   This
agreement  was amended in July 2000 to cover 23 additional CRJ  aircraft,
bringing the total number of CRJ aircraft covered under the agreement  to
66.   Under  the terms of the agreement, the Company pays  a  set  dollar
amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis to GE and GE assumes  the
responsibility  to  repair  the engines when required  at  no  additional
expense  to  the  Company,  subject to certain exclusions.   The  Company
expenses  the amount paid to GE based on the monthly rates stipulated  in
the   agreement,  as  engine  hours  are  flown.   The  Company's  future
maintenance  expense on CRJ engines covered under the new agreement  will
escalate  based  on  contractual rate increases, intended  to  match  the
timing  of actual maintenance events that are due pursuant to the  terms.
The  Company is presently negotiating with GE for an adjustment in rates.
The  Company believes that it has the right to remove any or all  engines
from  this  agreement at any time, and that it may remove  engines  if  a
favorable adjustment cannot be agreed.  GE has expressed the view that it
does not agree that the Company has the right to remove all engines,  but
nevertheless  is  participating in rate  discussions.   The  Company  has
signed  an  hourly maintenance agreement covering engines for  up  to  80
328JETs  with  Pratt & Whitney, and also anticipates  signing  a  similar
agreement for the remaining regional jets on order.

         Effective  September 2001, the Company entered  a  sixteen  year
maintenance  agreement with Air Canada covering maintenance,  repair  and
overhaul services for airframe components on its CRJ aircraft.  Under the
terms  of  this agreement, the Company pays a varying amount  per  flight
hour  each month, based on the age of the aircraft.  The Company expenses
the  amount  paid  to  Air Canada based on the rates  stipulated  in  the
agreement and the hours flown each month.  In February 2002, the  Company
entered into a five-year agreement with Air Canada covering the scheduled
airframe C-check overhaul of its CRJ aircraft.  The Company expenses this
cost as the overhaul is completed.

         Effective  January 2001, the Company entered into  an  agreement
with  BAE Systems Holdings, Inc. covering repair and overhaul of airframe
rotable  parts  on  the  Company's J-41 aircraft  through  the  remaining
service  life of the J-41 fleet.  Under the terms of this agreement,  the
Company  pays  a  fixed amount per flight hour each month.   The  Company
expenses the amount paid to BAE Systems Holdings, Inc. based on the rates
stipulated in the agreement and the hours flown each month.

          The   Company   has  entered  into  agreements  with   Pan   Am
International Flight Academy ("PAIFA"), which allow the Company to  train
CRJ,  J-41  and 328JET pilots at PAIFA's facility near Washington-Dulles.
In  2001,  PAIFA  relocated its Washington-Dulles  operations  to  a  new
training facility housing two CRJ simulators, a 328JET simulator, and a J-
41  simulator  near  the Company's Washington-Dulles  headquarters.   The
Company has agreements to purchase an annual minimum number of CRJ and J-
41  simulator training hours at agreed rates, through 2010 for  the  CRJ,
and 2002 for the J-41.  The Company's payment obligations for CRJ and  J-
41  simulator  usage  over the remaining years of  the  agreements  total
approximately $12.5 million.
<PAGE> 37
          In  2001,  a simulator provision and service agreement  between
PAIFA,  CAE  Schreiner and the Company was executed and  328JET  training
commenced  at the PAIFA facility.  Under this agreement, the Company  has
committed  to  purchase all of its 328JET simulator time  from  PAIFA  at
agreed  upon rates, with no minimum number of simulator hours guaranteed.
A second 328JET simulator is scheduled for installation at the Washington-
Dulles PAIFA simulator facility in July 2002.

          The  Company  has  committed to provide  its  senior  executive
officers  a  deferred compensation plan which utilizes split dollar  life
insurance polices, and for a certain officer, a make-whole provision  for
income  taxes,  post retirement salary based on ending salary,  and  post
retirement benefits based on benefits similar to those currently provided
to  the executive while actively employed.  The Company has estimated the
cost of the deferred compensation and tax gross up feature, future salary
and future benefits and is accruing this cost over the remaining required
service  time  of the executive officers.  In 2001, the Company  expensed
approximately $1.8 million as the current year's cost of these  benefits.
The  company  expects  to  recognize  similar  costs  annually  over  the
remaining required service life of the senior executives.

          In  1999,  the Company commenced a replacement project  of  its
computer    software   systems.    The   Company   anticipates   spending
approximately $11 million on this project, the majority of which will  be
capitalized  and  amortized  over seven  years.   In  1999,  the  Company
expensed approximately $400,000 related to replacement software selection
and capitalized $2.3 million in acquisition and implementation costs.  In
2000  and  2001, the Company capitalized an additional $5.2  million  and
$2.8   million  of  costs  incurred,  respectively,  bringing  the  total
capitalized costs to date to $10.3 million.  In October 2001, the Company
implemented a new Payroll/Human Resource system as part of this  project.
The Company anticipates completing the remainder of this project in 2002.

          The  Company's Board of Directors has approved the purchase  of
up  to  $40  million of the Company's outstanding common  stock  in  open
market  or  private transactions.  As of March 1, 2002, the  Company  has
purchased  2,128,000 shares of its common stock at an  average  price  of
$8.64  per  share.  The Company has approximately $21.6 million remaining
of the $40 million authorization.  The Company has not repurchased shares
of its common stock since February 2, 2000.

     Inflation

           Inflation  has  not  had a material effect  on  the  Company's
operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

          The  preparation  of  the  Company's  financial  statements  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires Company
management  to  make estimates and assumptions that affect  the  reported
amounts  of  assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses,  and  related
disclosures  of  contingent assets and liabilities  in  the  consolidated
financial  statements and accompanying notes.  The  U.S.  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  has  defined a company's most  critical  accounting
policies  as  the  ones that are most important to the portrayal  of  the
Company's financial condition and results, and which require the  company
to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of
the  need  to  make  estimates of matters that are inherently  uncertain.
Based  on  this  definition,  the Company  has  identified  its  critical
accounting policies as including those addressed below.  The Company also
has  other  key accounting policies, which involve the use of  estimates,
judgments and assumptions.  See Note 1 "Summary of Accounting Policies  "
in   the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional
discussion  of  these items.  Management believes that its estimates  and
assumptions  are reasonable, based upon information presently  available;
however,  actual results may differ from these estimates under  different
assumptions or conditions.
 <PAGE> 38
          Revenue Recognition: Under the proration-of-fare arrangement in
effect  with  United  until  November of  2000,  the  Company  recognized
passenger  revenue  when a flight was completed.  This  required  various
estimates  about passenger fares and other factors that were  subject  to
subsequent  adjustment  and settlement with United  and  other  carriers.
Following certain changes in estimates, which resulted in adjustments  in
2001,  as,  described in "Results of Operations", the  Company  does  not
expect  any  further adjustments attributable to the former proration-of-
fare  arrangement.   Under the fee-per-departure and fee-per-block hour
contracts  currently  in  place  with  United  and Delta, respectively,
revenue  is the  product of the  agreed  upon  rate  and  the  number of
departures or the number of block hours  flown.  Rates  are  generally
agreed to on  an  annual  basis  and  are  subject  to  adjustments upon
certain specified events.  In certain circumstances, the Company may  be
required to estimate these rates until final  rates  are agreed to by
either United or Delta.

          Major  maintenance  costs:  The Company has executed  long-term
agreements  with  the  engine manufacturers and other  service  providers
covering  the  repair and overhaul of its engines, airframe and  avionics
components,  and  landing  gear.   These  agreements  generally   include
escalating  rates  per flight hour over the term of the  agreement.   The
escalating   rates  are  intended  to  reflect  the  approximate   actual
maintenance  cost  increases as the aircraft age.  The  Company  expenses
costs based upon the current rate per hour and the number of aircraft and
engines  hours  for the period.  As a result, maintenance costs  for  the
Company's  existing  aircraft fleet are expected to  increase  in  future
years.

          Aircraft  leases:  The majority of the Company's  aircraft  are
leased   from   third   parties.  In  order  to  determine   the   proper
classification  of  a lease as either an operating  lease  or  a  capital
lease,  the Company must make certain estimates at the inception  of  the
lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset
as  well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting
future  lease  payments.  These estimates are utilized by  management  in
making  computations  as required by existing accounting  standards  that
determine  whether  the lease is classified as an operating  lease  or  a
capital  lease.  Substantially all of the Company's aircraft leases  have
been  classified  as operating leases, which results in  rental  payments
being   charged  to  expense  over  the  terms  of  the  related  leases.
Additionally, operating leases are not reflected in the balance sheet and
accordingly,  neither a lease asset nor an obligation  for  future  lease
payments are reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

          Aircraft  Early Retirement Costs:  In determining the  cost  of
the  early  retirement of leased aircraft (and thus  in  determining  the
amount  of  the  aircraft  early retirement  charge),  the  Company  must
estimate,  among  other  things,  market lease  rates,  future  sub-lease
income,  the  cost of maintenance return provisions and the duration  and
cost of aircraft storage.  The Company generally does not accrue for  the
costs  of retiring leased aircraft more than one year before the  planned
date  of  removal from service, considering the potential for changes  in
plans  and  associated costs. As the associated leases  may  extend  over
several years, these costs estimates are subject to change.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

          On  July  5,  2001,  the Financial Accounting  Standards  Board
issued  Statement  of Financial Accounting Standard No.  141,   "Business
Combinations",  and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard  No.  142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets".  Statement No. 141 addresses  the
accounting   for  acquisitions  of  businesses  and  is   effective   for
acquisitions  occurring  on or after July 1,  2001.   Statement  No.  142
includes  requirements  to test goodwill and indefinite  life  intangible
assets  for impairment rather than amortize them. Statement No. 142  will
be  effective  for fiscal years beginning after December 15,  2001.   The
Company  will adopt Statement No. 142 beginning in the first  quarter  of
2002.  The Company anticipates that implementation of SFAS 141  and  SFAS
142  will  have  minimal  impact on the Company's financial  position  or
results of operations.

          On  October  3, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board
issued  FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of  Long-Lived Assets, which addresses financial accounting and reporting
for  the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.  Statement No.  144
supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and APB Opinion
No.  30,  Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting  the  Effects  of
Disposal  of  a  Segment  of a Business, and Extraordinary,  Unusual  and
Infrequently  Occurring  Events  and  Transactions.   Statement  No.  144
includes requirements related to the classification of assets as held for
sale,  including the establishment of six criteria that must be satisfied
prior  to  this classification.  Statement No. 144 also includes guidance
related to the recognition and calculation of impairment losses for long-
lived  assets.   Statement  No. 144 will be effective  for  fiscal  years
beginning after December 15, 2001.  The Company will adopt Statement  No.
144 beginning in the first quarter of 2002.  The Company anticipates that
implementation  of  Statement No. 144 will have  minimal  impact  on  the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

Item 7A.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

          The  Company's  principal market risk  results  in  changes  in
interest rates.

          The  Company's exposure to market risk associated with  changes
in interest rates relates to the Company's commitment to acquire regional
jets.   From  time  to time the Company has entered  into  put  and  call
contracts  designed  to  limit the Company's exposure  to  interest  rate
changes  until  permanent  financing is  secured  upon  delivery  of  the
Bombardier  regional  jet aircraft. During 1999  and  2000,  the  Company
settled  seven  and  eight  hedge transactions,  respectively,  receiving
$119,000 in 1999 and paying the counterparty $379,000 in 2000.  In  1999,
the  Company  recognized  a gain of $211,000 on  the  settlement  of  one
contract,  representing the ineffective portion of a hedge.  At  December
31, 2000 the Company had one interest rate hedge transaction open with  a
notional  value  of $8.5 million.  The Company settled this  contract  on
January 3, 2001 by paying the counterparty $722,000.  The Company had  no
open hedge transactions at December 31, 2001.

          As  of  March  1,  2002, the Company had  firm  commitments  to
purchase  68  additional jet aircraft.  The Company  expects  to  finance
these  commitments  using  a combination of debt  and  leveraged  leases.
Changes in interest rates will impact the actual cost to the Company  for
these transactions.  Aircraft orders are also subject to price escalation
formulas based on certain indices designed to reflect increased costs  in
the  production  of  the aircraft.  During 2001 the  rate  of  escalation
increased,  and such increases will be reflected in future aircraft  cost
or lease rates.  During the first quarter of 2002, the rate of escalation
has remained constant.
<PAGE> 40
          The  Company  does  not have significant exposure  to  changing
interest  rates on its long-term debt as the interest rates on such  debt
are fixed.  The Company's interest rate on its $25 million line of credit
is  dependent  on  LIBOR plus a percentage ranging from .875%  to  1.375%
depending  on  the Company's fixed charges coverage ratio.   The  Company
does  not hold long-term interest sensitive assets and therefore  is  not
exposed  to  interest rate fluctuations for its assets. The Company  does
not  purchase  or hold any derivative financial instruments  for  trading
purposes.

                      Independent Auditors' Report


The Board of Directors and Stockholders Atlantic Coast Airlines Holdings,
Inc.:

We  have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atlantic
Coast  Airlines Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December  31,  2000
and   2001,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the  three-
year  period  ended  December  31, 2001.   These  consolidated  financial
statements  are  the  responsibility of the  Company's  management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards  generally
accepted  in the United States of America.  Those standards require  that
we  plan  and  perform  the  audit to obtain reasonable  assurance  about
whether  the financial statements are free of material misstatement.   An
audit  includes  examining,  on  a test basis,  evidence  supporting  the
amounts  and  disclosures  in the financial statements.   An  audit  also
includes   assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to  above
present  fairly,  in  all material respects, the  financial  position  of
Atlantic  Coast Airlines Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as  of  December
31,  2000  and 2001, and the results of their operations and  their  cash
flows  for each of the years in the three-year period ended December  31,
2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in  the
United States of America.

As  discussed  in  Note  1  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,
effective  January 1, 1999, the Company changed its method of  accounting
for preoperating costs.

1.   Summary of
Accounting
Policies         (a)Basis of Presentation

                    The     accompanying    consolidated    financial
                    statements include the accounts of Atlantic Coast
                    Airlines  Holdings, Inc. ("ACAI") and its  wholly
                    owned    subsidiaries,  Atlantic  Coast  Airlines
                    ("ACA")  and Atlantic Coast Jet, Inc.  ("ACJet"),
                    (together, the "Company"). On July 1, 2001,  ACAI
                    combined  the operations of its ACJet  subsidiary
                    into  the  operations  of ACA.   All  significant
                    intercompany accounts and transactions have  been
                    eliminated   in  consolidation.   The   Company's
                    flights   are   operated   under   code   sharing
                    agreements  with United Airlines, Inc. ("United")
                    and  Delta  Airlines ("Delta") and are identified
                    as United Express and Delta Connection flights in
                    computer reservation systems.  As of December 31,
                    2001,   the   Company  provided   scheduled   air
                    transportation  service  as  United  Express  for
                    passengers  to  destinations  in  states  in  the
                    Eastern   and  Midwestern  United  States.    The
                    Company  provides  scheduled  air  transportation
                    service    as   Delta   Connection   to   various
                    destinations  in  the Eastern United  States  and
                    Canada.

                 (b)Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

                    The   Company  considers  investments   with   an
                    original  maturity of three months or  less  when
                    purchased  to  be cash equivalents.   Investments
                    with  an  original  maturity greater  than  three
                    months  and  less  than one year  are  considered
                    short-term investments. In addition, the  Company
                    holds  investments in tax-free Industrial Revenue
                    Bonds ("IRB") having initial maturities up to  30
                    years.   The  IRB's  are secured  by  letters  of
                    credit  or insured and come up for auction  on  a
                    weekly  or  monthly basis.  As such, the  Company
                    considers  securities of this type to  be  short-
                    term  investments.   All  short-term  investments
                    are considered to be available for sale.  Due  to
                    the   short   maturities  associated   with   the
                    Company's   investments,   the   amortized   cost
                    approximates fair market value.  Accordingly,  no
                    adjustment  has  been made to  record  unrealized
                    holding gains and losses.

                 (c)Airline Revenues

                    Passenger  revenues  are  recorded  as  operating
                    revenues  at the time transportation is provided.
                    Under  the Company's fee-per-departure  and  fee-
                    per-block  hour  agreements,  transportation   is
                    considered  provided  when the  flight  has  been
                    completed.    Under   the   proration   of   fare
                    agreement  in  effect  with  United  for  periods
                    prior    to    and    through   November    2000,
                    transportation was considered provided  when  the
                    passenger  flew.   All of the  passenger  tickets
                    used  by  the  Company's revenue  passengers  are
                    sold by other air carriers.

                    ACA   participates  in  United's   Mileage   Plus
                    frequent  flyer program and in the Delta SkyMiles
                    frequent  flyer  program.  The Company  does  not
                    accrue   for   incremental  costs   for   mileage
                    accumulation  or  redemption  relating  to  these
                    programs  because  the  Company  operates   under
                    agreements with United and Delta, which  are  not
                    affected  by  the number of miles earned  by  its
                    passengers  or  number  of  passengers   on   its
                    flights redeeming miles.

                 (d)Accounts and Notes Receivable

                    Accounts  receivable are stated net of allowances
                    for   uncollectible  accounts  of   approximately
                    $755,000  and $595,000 at December 31,  2000  and
                    2001,  respectively.  Amounts charged to expenses
                    for uncollectible accounts in 1999, 2000 and 2001
                    were    $564,000,    $503,000    and    $227,000,
                    respectively.   Write-off of accounts  receivable
                    were  $156,000,  $521,000 and $386,000  in  1999,
                    2000 and 2001, respectively.  Accounts receivable
                    as  of December 31, 2000 and 2001 included ticket
                    receivables  of  $18.6 million and  $1.3  million
                    respectively, and approximately $5.6 million  and
                    $4.4    million,   respectively,    related    to
                    manufacturers  credits  to  be  applied   towards
                    future   spare   parts  purchases  and   training
                    expenses.   The   large   decrease   in    ticket
                    receivables  is due to the change in  the  United
                    Express   agreement   from  a   proration-of-fare
                    arrangement to a fee-per-departure arrangement as
                    described herein.

                 (e)Concentrations of Credit Risk

                    Substantially  all  of  the  Company's  passenger
                    tickets are sold by other air carriers.  Prior to
                    the change from a proration of fare agreement  to
                    a  fee-per-departure agreement, the Company had a
                    significant   concentration   of   its   accounts
                    receivable  with  other  air  carriers  with   no
                    collateral.   At  December  31,  2000  and  2001,
                    accounts  receivable  from air  carriers  totaled
                    approximately   $18.6   million   and   $929,000,
                    respectively.  Of the total amount, approximately
                    $13.3  million and $240,000 at December 31,  2000
                    and  2001,  respectively, were due  from  United.
                    Under   the  fee-per-departure  agreements,   the
                    Company  receives  payment in advance  from  both
                    United   and   Delta.    Historically,   accounts
                    receivable losses have not been significant.

                 (f)Risks and Uncertainties

                    The events  of  September 11,  together with  the
                    slowing economy throughout 2001, have significantly
                    affected the U.S. airline industry.  These events
                    have resulted in changed government   regulation,
                    declines and shifts in passenger demand, increased
                    insurance costs and tightened credit markets which
                    continue to  affect  the operations  and financial
                    condition of participants in the industry including
                    the Company, its code share partners, and aircraft
                    manufacturers.   These  circumstances have raised
                    substantial  risks and   uncertainties, including
                    those discussed below, which may inpact the Company,
                    its code share partners, and aircraft manufacturers,
                    in ways that the Company is not currently able to
                    predict.

                    United Express:

                    The  Company's  United  Express  Agreements  ("UA
                    Agreements")  define  the Company's  relationship
                    with  United.   The UA Agreements  authorize  the
                    Company  to  use United's "UA" flight  designator
                    code  to identify the Company's flights and fares
                    in   the   major  airline  Computer   Reservation
                    Systems,  including United's "Apollo" reservation
                    system,  to use the United Express logo,  to  use
                    United's exterior aircraft paint schemes, and  to
                    use uniforms similar to those of United.

                    In   November  2000,  the  Company   and   United
                    restated  the UA Agreements, effectively changing
                    from  a  prorated fare arrangement to a  fee-per-
                    departure   arrangement.   Under   the   fee-per-
                    departure     structure,    the    Company     is
                    contractually  obligated to  operate  the  flight
                    schedule,  for which United pays the  Company  an
                    agreed  amount  per departure regardless  of  the
                    number  of  passengers  carried,  with  incentive
                    payments  based on operational performance.   The
                    Company  thereby  assumes  the  risks  associated
                    with  operating  the flight schedule  and  United
                    assumes  the  risk of scheduling, marketing,  and
                    selling  seats  to  the  traveling  public.   The
                    restated  UA  Agreements are for a  term  of  ten
                    years.   The restated UA Agreements give ACA  the
                    authority  to operate 128 regional  jets  in  the
                    United   Express  operation.   Pursuant  to   the
                    restated UA Agreements, United provides a  number
                    of  additional services to ACA at no cost.  These
                    include  customer reservations, customer service,
                    pricing, scheduling, revenue accounting,  revenue
                    management,    frequent   flyer   administration,
                    advertising,   provision   of   ground    support
                    services at most of the airports served  by  both
                    United  and  ACA,  provision of  ticket  handling
                    services  at  United's ticketing  locations,  and
                    provision  of  airport signage at airports  where
                    both  ACA  and United operate.  The UA Agreements
                    do  not  prohibit  United from serving,  or  from
                    entering into agreements with other airlines  who
                    would  serve,  routes served by the Company,  but
                    state   that   United  may   terminate   the   UA
                    Agreements  if ACAI or ACA enter into  a  similar
                    arrangement  with  any other carrier  other  than
                    Delta   or   a  replacement  for  Delta   without
                    United's   prior   written  approval.    The   UA
                    Agreements limit the ability of ACAI and  ACA  to
                    merge  with another company or dispose of certain
                    assets  or  aircraft without  offering  United  a
                    right of first refusal to acquire the Company  or
                    such  assets  or aircraft, and provide  United  a
                    right  to terminate the UA Agreements if ACAI  or
                    ACA  merge with or are controlled or acquired  by
                    another   carrier.  The  UA  agreements   provide
                    United  with the right to assume ACA's  ownership
                    or  leasehold interest in certain aircraft in the
                    event  ACA breaches specified provisions  of  the
                    UA   agreements,  or  fails  to  meet   specified
                    performance  standards.  The UA  Agreements  call
                    for  the  resetting  of  fee-for-departure  rates
                    annually based on the Company's planned level  of
                    operations for the upcoming year.

                    UAL   Corporation,  the  parent  of  United,  has
                    disclosed that during the fourth quarter 2001  it
                    began  implementing  a  financial  recovery  plan
                    that includes four planks:  reducing the size  of
                    the  airline  and cutting capital  and  operating
                    spending  in line with that reduction, generating
                    as  much  revenue as possible from  each  flight,
                    working   with  its  unions  and  other  employee
                    groups   to   find  further  labor  savings   and
                    implementing  a  financing  plan  to  support  it
                    through  the execution of its financial  recovery
                    plan.   UAL  Corporation further  disclosed  that
                    the  impact of the events of September  11,  2001
                    on  United  and the sufficiency of its  financial
                    resources to absorb that impact are dependent  on
                    a  number of factors, including United's  success
                    in implementing its financial recovery plan.

                    Following  September  11, United  requested  that
                    the  Company propose measures that it could  take
                    to   assist   in  improving  United's   financial
                    situation.   The  Company  believes  that  United
                    made  a  similar request to other  suppliers  and
                    vendors.   On December 31, 2001, the Company  and
                    United  agreed on fee-per-departure rates  to  be
                    utilized  during  2002.   In  addition,  in   the
                    context  of reaching this agreement, the  Company
                    agreed  to certain concessions that would benefit
                    United  by (1) settling various existing contract
                    issues,  (2) agreeing that United would not  have
                    to  pay  increased  rates to reflect  utilization
                    changes  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2001,  (3)
                    agreeing  to  2002 rates that require  aggressive
                    cost   containment,  and  (4)   reaffirming   its
                    commitment   to   retire   the   Company's   J-41
                    turboprop aircraft.  The Company determined  that
                    these   concessions,  which  were  favorable   to
                    United   as   compared   to   prior   contractual
                    arrangements  and were designed to assist  United
                    in  its financial recovery plan, were appropriate
                    in light of the circumstances at the time.

                    In  late  March 2002, United informed the Company
                    that  an  essential component  of  its  financial
                    recovery  plan includes obtaining cost reductions
                    from  its employees, suppliers and partners,  and
                    that   United  is seeking the Company's assistance
                    in decreasing the cost of the Company's product
                    and  achieving  cash  flow   improvements
                    for United  over  the  next  24  months.   The
                    Company  has  commenced discussions  with  United
                    regarding  opportunities for reducing  its  costs
                    or  creating value to address United's  financial
                    situation.   The  basis for, nature,  timing  and
                    extent  of any such actions has not been  agreed.
                    While  the  Company has expressed its willingness
                    to  work  with United to find mutually acceptable
                    opportunities, the Company believes  that  it  is
                    not  contractually obligated  to  make  any  such
                    changes  under  the United Express Agreements  or
                    the  December  31,  2001 rate setting  agreement.

                    Delta Connection:

                    In  September  1999, the Company reached  a  ten-
                    year  agreement  with Delta to  operate  regional
                    jet  aircraft  as  part of the  Delta  Connection
                    program  on  a  fee-per-block  hour  basis.   The
                    Company  began  Delta Connection revenue  service
                    on   August   1,   2000.   The  Company's   Delta
                    Connection  Agreement  ("DL  Agreement")  defines
                    the   Company's  relationship  with  Delta.   The
                    Company   is   compensated   by   Delta   on    a
                    fee-per-block  hour  basis.  Under  the  fee-per-
                    block    hour    structure,   the   Company    is
                    contractually  obligated to  operate  the  flight
                    schedule,  for  which Delta pays the  Company  an
                    agreed amount per block hour flown regardless  of
                    passenger   revenue  with  additional   incentive
                    payments  based on operational performance.   The
                    Company  thereby  assumes  the  risks  associated
                    with  operating  the  flight schedule  and  Delta
                    assumes  the risks of scheduling, marketing,  and
                    selling  seats  to  the  traveling  public.    By
                    operating   as  part  of  the  Delta   Connection
                    program, the Company is able to use Delta's  "DL"
                    flight  designator to identify ACA's flights  and
                    fares  in the major Computer Reservation Systems,
                    including    Delta's   "Deltamatic"   reservation
                    system, and to use the Delta Connection logo  and
                    exterior  aircraft  paint  schemes  and  uniforms
                    similar to those of Delta.

                    Due  to  the rapid increase in fleet size  during
                    2001,   the   Company   and   Delta   agreed   to
                    compensation  based on a cost plus formula  based
                    on  reimbursement  of fixed amounts  for  initial
                    pilot  training expenses and for all other costs,
                    based   on   actual   costs  incurred,   plus   a
                    contracted  margin,  and  incentive  compensation
                    tied  to operating performance.  The Company  and
                    Delta  have  agreed to return to a  fee-per-block
                    hour rate arrangement for 2002.  The Company  and
                    Delta are currently setting these rates based  on
                    the  Company's  planned level of  operations  for
                    the   upcoming  year.    The  Company  does   not
                    anticipate  material differences on a  per-block-
                    hour  basis for its 2002 revenues as compared  to
                    2001  revenues due to the reversion to a fee-per-
                    block-hour rate.

                    Pursuant  to  the  DL Agreement,  Delta,  at  its
                    expense,  provides a number of  support  services
                    to  ACA.   These  include customer  reservations,
                    customer   service,   ground  handling,   station
                    operations,    pricing,    scheduling,    revenue
                    accounting,  revenue management,  frequent  flyer
                    administration, advertising and other  passenger,
                    aircraft  and  traffic  servicing  functions   in
                    connection  with  the ACA operation.   Delta  may
                    terminate  the DL Agreement at any  time  if  the
                    Company  fails  to  maintain certain  performance
                    standards and, subject to certain rights  of  the
                    Company and by providing 180 days notice  to  the
                    Company,  may terminate without cause,  effective
                    no   earlier  than  August  1,  2002.   If  Delta
                    terminates  the  Delta  agreement  without  cause
                    prior  to  March 2010, the Company has the  right
                    to  put  all  or  some  of the  Delta  Connection
                    aircraft to Delta.  In January 2001, the  Company
                    reached  an  agreement with United and  Delta  to
                    place   20  Bombardier  Canadair  Regional   Jets
                    ("CRJ's")   originally  ordered  for  the   Delta
                    Connection   program   in  the   United   Express
                    program.   The DL Agreement requires the  Company
                    to  obtain  Delta's approval  if  it  chooses  to
                    enter   into  a  code-sharing  arrangement   with
                    another  carrier  other than  a  replacement  for
                    United,  to  list  its flights  under  any  other
                    code,   or  to  operate  flights  for  any  other
                    carrier,    except   with   respect    to    such
                    arrangements  with United or non-U.S.  code-share
                    partners   of   United  or   in   certain   other
                    circumstances.    The  DL  Agreement   does   not
                    prohibit  Delta  from serving, or  from  entering
                    into  agreements  with other airlines  who  would
                    serve,  routes  flown  by the  Company.   The  DL
                    Agreement  also  restricts  the  ability  of  the
                    Company  to  dispose of aircraft subject  to  the
                    agreement  without  offering  Delta  a  right  of
                    first  refusal  to  acquire  such  aircraft,  and
                    provides  that Delta may extend or terminate  the
                    agreement  if,  among other things,  the  Company
                    merges  with  or  sells  its  assets  to  another
                    entity, is acquired by another entity or  if  any
                    person  acquires more than a specified percentage
                    of its stock.

                    At  December  31, 2001 54 CRJs,  and  31  British
                    Aerospace  J-41's ("J-41's") were operated  under
                    the  United  Express program  and  29  Fairchild-
                    Dornier  328  Jets ("328JET's")  and  three  CRJs
                    were   operated   under  the   Delta   Connection
                    program.   For the year ended December 31,  2001,
                    82%  of  consolidated revenues were derived  from
                    the   United   Express   program   and   18%   of
                    consolidated  revenues  were  derived  from   the
                    Delta   Connection   program.    Following    the
                    terrorist  attacks  on September  11,  2001,  the
                    major  U.S.  airlines  have suffered  substantial
                    losses  and  continued losses are expected  until
                    passenger  traffic levels substantially  recover.
                    Notwithstanding that the terms of  the  Company's
                    agreements with its major U.S. airline  partners,
                    as  described  above, extend several  years  into
                    the  future, the near term loss of either of  the
                    Company's  code  share  agreements would, unless
                    replaced  by a  similar agreement  with another
                    carrier, likely have  a  material adverse impact
                    on  the  Company financial position and operating
                    results.

                    Fairchild Dornier Purchase Agreement:

                    Fairchild  Dornier,  the  manufacturer   of   the
                    328JET,  recently stated that it has an immediate
                    and  critical  need for additional  funding,  and
                    that  it is in discussions with several potential
                    strategic     partners     regarding     proposed
                    investments.   The Company is unable  to  predict
                    whether  Fairchild Dornier will be successful  in
                    finding   additional  capital  or  in   otherwise
                    restructuring  its  finances, but  believes  that
                    Fairchild   Dornier  may  be   forced   to   seek
                    bankruptcy  protection if it is  unsuccessful  in
                    its   efforts.   In  the  event  of  a  Fairchild
                    Dornier   bankruptcy,  Fairchild  Dornier   could
                    either sell, liquidate or reorganize some or  all
                    of  its  businesses,  and  in  the  event  of   a
                    reorganization  or sale of its  businesses  would
                    have   the  right  to  assume  or  reject  future
                    contractual   obligations.    Should    Fairchild
                    Dornier  be  unable to deliver  ordered  328JETS,
                    the     Company    would    reassess    available
                    alternatives in pursuing its growth strategy  and
                    possibly    delay    the   Company's    turboprop
                    retirement   plans,   and  adjust   other   plans
                    discussed  elsewhere in this Form  10-K  relating
                    to its 328JET aircraft.

                    Fairchild   Dornier   has   significant    future
                    obligations  to  the Company in  connection  with
                    the  order  of  328JET aircraft.   These  include
                    obligations:  to deliver 32 firm ordered  328JETs
                    and  81  additional option 328JETs  with  certain
                    financing   support;  to  pay  the  Company   any
                    difference  between the lease payments,  if  any,
                    received   from   remarketing   the   26  J-41
                    aircraft  leased  by the Company  and  the  lease
                    payment  obligations  of  the  Company  on  those
                    aircraft;  to  purchase five J-41 aircraft  owned
                    by  the  Company at their net book value  at  the
                    time   of  retirement;  to  assume  certain  crew
                    training   costs;   and,   to   provide   spares,
                    warranty,   engineering,  and  related   support.
                    Fairchild  Dornier has delayed  the  delivery  of
                    one 328JET that was scheduled to be delivered  to
                    the  Company  during the week of March  25,  2002
                    for  reasons  connected with its financing.   The
                    Company   believes  it  has  secured  rights   to
                    Fairchild  Dornier's  equity  interest   in   the
                    delivered 328JETs that it may proceed against  in
                    the   event  that  Fairchild  Dornier  fails   to
                    fulfill certain of these obligations.

                    During  the  fourth quarter of 2001, the  Company
                    recorded  a  pre-tax  aircraft  early  retirement
                    charge  of $23.5 million for the early retirement
                    of  nine  leased Jetstream-41 turboprop aircraft,
                    which  the  Company plans to remove from  service
                    prior  to year-end 2002.  The Company anticipates
                    taking   additional  charges   during   2002   of
                    approximately  $48.0  million  pre-tax  for   the
                    retirement  of its remaining 29-seat Jetstream-41
                    turboprop  aircraft.  The undiscounted  remaining
                    lease  obligations (net of the Company's estimate
                    of  the  future  sublease rentals)  on  the  J-41
                    fleet after planned retirement dates in 2002  and
                    2003  are  approximately $55 million and continue
                    through  2010  and  the book value  of  the  five
                    owned  J-41 aircraft as of March 1, 2002 is $18.1
                    million.   To  the extent that Fairchild  Dornier
                    fulfills   its   contractual   obligations,   the
                    majority of the aircraft early retirement  charge
                    will  not  adversely  affect the  Company's  cash
                    position, with the payments by Fairchild  Dornier
                    being    recorded   as   an   aircraft   purchase
                    inducement  on the 328JET aircraft.  The  Company
                    would remain liable for the lease payments on its
                    J-41 aircraft  and  thus  be  required to pay the
                    remaining lease  payments if,  and  to the extent
                    that,  Fairchild  Dornier were to default on its
                    obligation.

                    Collective Bargaining Agreements:

                    The Company's pilots are represented by the
                    Airline Pilots Association ("ALPA"), flight
                    attendants are represented by the Association of
                    Flight Attendants ("AFA"), and aviation
                    maintenance technicians and ground service
                    equipment mechanics are represented by the
                    Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association
                    ("AMFA").

                    The  ALPA collective bargaining agreement  became
                    amendable  in  February 2000 and in  early  2001,
                    the  Company's pilots ratified a new  four-and-a-
                    half  year agreement in effect until August 2005.
                    This  agreement provides for improvements in  pay
                    rates,  benefits, training and other areas.   The
                    collective  bargaining  agreement  covers  pilots
                    flying    for    both    the    Atlantic    Coast
                    Airlines/United  Express operation,  as  well  as
                    the   Atlantic  Coast  Airlines/Delta  Connection
                    operation.    The  new  agreement  provides   for
                    substantial   increases  in  pilot  compensation,
                    which  the  Company believes are consistent  with
                    regional airline industry trends.

                    ACA's  collective bargaining agreement  with  AFA
                    was  ratified in October 1998.  The agreement  is
                    for  a  four-year duration and becomes  amendable
                    in October 2002.

                    The  collective  bargaining agreement  with  AMFA
                    was  ratified in June 1998.  The agreement is for
                    a  four-year  duration and becomes  amendable  in
                    June  2002.   This agreement covers all  aviation
                    maintenance   technicians  and   ground   service
                    equipment mechanics working for the Company.

                    Aviation Insurance

                    Following  the  September 11  terrorist  attacks,
                    the   aviation  insurance  industry   imposed   a
                    worldwide  surcharge on aviation insurance  rates
                    as  well  as a reduction in coverage for  certain
                    war  risks.   In  response to  the  reduction  in
                    coverage,  the  Air  Transportation  Safety   and
                    System   Stabilization  Act  provided  U.S.   air
                    carriers with the option to purchase certain  war
                    risk  liability insurance from the United  States
                    government on an interim basis at rates that  are
                    more  favorable  than those  available  from  the
                    private market.   Prior to September 11,  it  was
                    not  customary for independent regional  airlines
                    to  carry  general  war  risk  insurance.   Since
                    September 11, the Company has purchased hull  war
                    risk   coverage  through  the  private  insurance
                    market  through  September  24,  2002,  and   has
                    purchased  liability war risk coverage  from  the
                    U.S.   government  through  May  19,   2002   and
                    anticipates  renewing  the  government  insurance
                    for  as  long as the coverage is available.   The
                    airlines  and  insurance industry, together  with
                    the  United  States  and other  governments,  are
                    continuing to evaluate both the cost and  options
                    for  providing  coverage of  aviation  insurance.
                    Recently,  an  industry-led  group  announced   a
                    proposal  to  create a mutual insurance  company,
                    to  be  called  Equitime, to cover war  risk  and
                    terrorism   risk,  which  would  initially   seek
                    support  through government guarantees.  Equitime
                    would   provide  a  competitive  alternative   to
                    insurance   being  offered  by  the   traditional
                    insurance  market, which opposes this initiative.
                    Equitime's  organizers project  that  it  may  be
                    available  to provide insurance as early  as  May
                    2002 to up to 70 U.S. carriers.  The Company  has
                    not  been  actively involved in the formation  of
                    Equitime  and  is  unable to  anticipate  whether
                    this  source of insurance will be made  available
                    and,  if  so,  whether it will offer  competitive
                    rates.   The  Company anticipates  that  it  will
                    follow   industry  practices  with   respect   to
                    sources of insurance.

                 (g)Use of Estimates

                    The   preparation  of  financial  statements   in
                    accordance  with accounting principles  generally
                    accepted in the United States of America requires
                    management   to   make  certain   estimates   and
                    assumptions   regarding  valuation   of   assets,
                    recognition  of  liabilities for  costs  such  as
                    aircraft  maintenance, differences in  timing  of
                    air   traffic  billings  from  United  and  other
                    airlines, operating revenues and expenses  during
                    the  period  and disclosure of contingent  assets
                    and  liabilities at the date of the  consolidated
                    financial   statements.   Actual  results   could
                    differ from those estimated.

                 (h)Expendable Parts

                    Expendable parts and supplies are stated  at  the
                    lower  of  cost or market, less an allowance  for
                    obsolescence of $665,000 and $1.2 million  as  of
                    December   31,   2000  and  2001,   respectively.
                    Expendable  parts  and supplies  are  charged  to
                    expense  as  they are used.  Amounts  charged  to
                    costs and expenses for obsolescence in 1999, 2000
                    and  2001  were $110,000, $237,000 and  $578,000,
                    respectively.

<PAGE> 56
                 (i)Property and Equipment

                    Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at   cost.
                    Depreciation  is computed using the straight-line
                    method  over  the estimated useful lives  of  the
                    related  assets that range from five  to  sixteen
                    and one half years.  Capital leases and leasehold
                    improvements  are amortized over the  shorter  of
                    the  estimated life or the remaining term of  the
                    lease.

                    Amortization  of  capital  leases  and  leasehold
                    improvements is included in depreciation expense.

                    The Company periodically evaluates whether events
                    and  circumstances have occurred which may impact
                    the   remaining  estimated  useful  life  or  the
                    recoverability of the remaining carrying value of
                    its   long-lived  assets.   If  such  events   or
                    circumstances were to indicate that the  carrying
                    amount  of these assets would not be recoverable,
                    the  Company would estimate the future cash flows
                    expected to result from the use of the assets and
                    their  eventual disposition.  If the sum  of  the
                    expected  future  cash  flows  (undiscounted  and
                    without  interest  charges)  is  less  than   the
                    carrying amount of the asset, an impairment  loss
                    would be recognized by the Company.

                 (j)Preoperating Costs

                    Preoperating   costs  represent   the   cost   of
                    integrating new types of aircraft. Prior to 1999,
                    such  costs,  which consist primarily  of  flight
                    crew  training  and  aircraft  ownership  related
                    costs,  were deferred and amortized over a period
                    of  four  years  on a straight-line  basis.   The
                    American    Institute   of    Certified    Public
                    Accountants  issued Statement  of  Position  98-5
                    ("SOP  98-5")  on accounting for start-up  costs,
                    including  preoperating  costs  related  to   the
                    introduction of new fleet types by airlines.

                    During 1997 the Company capitalized approximately
                    $2.1  million  of  these  costs  related  to  the
                    introduction of the regional jet ("CRJ") into the
                    Company's  fleet.   Accumulated  amortization  of
                    preoperating  costs  at  December  31,  1998  was
                    $571,000.  On January 1, 1999, the Company wrote-
                    off  the remaining unamortized preoperating costs
                    balance  of  approximately $1.5  million,  before
                    income  tax  benefit of $598,000,  in  accordance
                    with  the  implementation of SOP 98-5.  Also,  in
                    accordance  with  SOP  98-5,  approximately  $2.2
                    million  of  preoperating costs  incurred  during
                    1999   and   approximately   $5.6   million    of
                    preoperating costs incurred during 2000  for  the
                    start up of ACJet were expensed as incurred.
<PAGE> 57
                 (k)Intangible Assets

                    Goodwill    of   approximately   $3.2    million,
                    representing  the excess of cost  over  the  fair
                    value  of  net assets acquired in the acquisition
                    of  ACA,  is being amortized by the straight-line
                    method  over  twenty  years.  Costs  incurred  to
                    acquire slots are being amortized by the straight-
                    line  method  over  twenty years.    The  primary
                    financial indicator used by the Company to assess
                    the  recoverability of its intangible  assets  is
                    undiscounted  future cash flows from  operations.
                    The  amount  of impairment, if any,  is  measured
                    based  on  projected future cash  flows  using  a
                    discount  rate  reflecting the Company's  average
                    cost   of  funds.  Accumulated  amortization   of
                    intangible assets at December 31, 2000  and  2001
                    was $1.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively.

                    In   accordance  with  Statement   of   Financial
                    Accounting Standards No. 142, (see Footnote  16),
                    which  the  Company will adopt as of  January  1,
                    2002,   the  Company  will  no  longer  recognize
                    amortization of its goodwill and slots  for  2002
                    and future years.

                 (l)Maintenance

                    The  Company  has  executed long term  agreements
                    with  the engine manufacturers and other  service
                    providers  covering repair and  overhaul  of  its
                    engines,  airframe and avionics  components,  and
                    landing  gear.   These  agreements  call  for  an
                    escalating rate per hour flown over the  life  of
                    the   agreement.    The   Company's   maintenance
                    accounting policy is to expense amounts based  on
                    the  current  rate  as  the aircraft  are  flown.
                    Prior   to   the  execution  of  these  long-term
                    maintenance agreements, the Company's maintenance
                    policy  was  a  combination of expensing  certain
                    events  as  incurred  and  accruing  for  certain
                    maintenance events at rates it estimated would be
                    sufficient  to  cover maintenance  cost  for  the
                    aircraft.

                    In   2000,  the  Company  executed  a  seven-year
                    engine   services  agreement   with   GE   Engine
                    Services, Inc. ("GE") covering the scheduled  and
                    unscheduled  repair  of ACA's  CRJ  jet  engines,
                    operated on the 43 CRJs already delivered  or  on
                    order  for  the  United Express operation.   This
                    agreement  was amended in July 2000 to  cover  23
                    additional  CRJ  aircraft,  bringing  the   total
                    number   of   CRJ  aircraft  covered  under   the
                    agreement  to  66.   Under  the  terms   of   the
                    agreement,  the Company pays a set dollar  amount
                    per  engine hour flown on a monthly basis  to  GE
                    and  GE assumes the responsibility to repair  the
                    engines  when  required at no additional  expense
                    to  the  Company, subject to certain  exclusions.
                    The  Company expenses the amount paid to GE based
                    on   the   monthly   rates  stipulated   in   the
                    agreement,  as  engine  hours  are  flown.    The
                    Company's  future  maintenance  expense  on   CRJ
                    engines  covered  under the  new  agreement  will
                    escalate  based  on contractual  rate  increases,
                    intended   to   match  the   timing   of   actual
                    maintenance events that are due pursuant  to  the
                    terms.    The  Company  has  signed   a   similar
                    agreement  covering engines for up to 80  328JETs
                    with Pratt & Whitney.
<PAGE> 58
                    Effective  September 2001, the Company entered  a
                    sixteen  year  maintenance  agreement  with   Air
                    Canada  covering maintenance, repair and overhaul
                    services  for  airframe  components  on  its  CRJ
                    aircraft.   Under  the terms of  this  agreement,
                    the  Company  pays  a varying amount  per  flight
                    hour  each  month,  based  on  the  age  of   the
                    aircraft.   The Company expenses the amount  paid
                    to  Air  Canada based on the rates stipulated  in
                    the agreement and the hours flown each month.

                    Effective January 2001, the Company entered  into
                    an  agreement  with  BAE Systems  Holdings,  Inc.
                    covering repair and overhaul of airframe  rotable
                    parts on the Company's J-41 aircraft through  the
                    remaining service life of the J-41 fleet.   Under
                    the  terms of this agreement, the Company pays  a
                    fixed  amount  per flight hour each  month.   The
                    Company  expenses the amount paid to BAE  Systems
                    Holdings,  Inc. based on the rates stipulated  in
                    the agreement and the hours flown each month.

                    During  the  third quarter of 1999,  the  Company
                    reversed  approximately  $1.5  million  in   life
                    limited parts repair expense accruals related  to
                    CRJ engines that are no longer required based  on
                    the  maintenance services and terms contained  in
                    the GE engine maintenance agreement.

                 (m)Deferred Credits

                    The  Company accounts for incentives provided  by
                    the  aircraft  manufacturers as deferred  credits
                    for leased aircraft.  These credits are amortized
                    on  a straight-line basis as a reduction to lease
                    expense  over  the respective  lease  term.   The
                    incentives  are  credits  that  may  be  used  to
                    purchase  spare parts, pay for training expenses,
                    or be applied against future rental payments.

                 (n)Income Taxes

                    The  Company accounts for income taxes using  the
                    asset and liability method.  Under the asset  and
                    liability   method,  deferred  tax   assets   and
                    liabilities  are recognized for  the  future  tax
                    consequences attributable to differences  between
                    the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  for
                    existing   assets  and  liabilities   and   their
                    respective  tax bases.  Deferred tax  assets  and
                    liabilities are measured using enacted tax  rates
                    expected  to  apply to taxable income  in  future
                    years  in  which those temporary differences  are
                    expected to be recovered or settled.

                 (o)Stock-Based Compensation

                    The   Company   accounts  for   its   stock-based
                    compensation  plans  using  the  intrinsic  value
                    method  prescribed  under  Accounting  Principles
                    Board (APB) No. 25.  As such, the Company records
                    compensation expense for stock options and awards
                    only  if the exercise price is less than the fair
                    market  value  of  the stock on  the  measurement
                    date.

                 (p)Income Per Share

                    Basic  income per share is computed  by  dividing
                    net  income  by  the weighted average  number  of
                    common  shares outstanding.  Diluted  income  per
                    share  is computed by dividing net income by  the
                    weighted   average   number  of   common   shares
                    outstanding  and common stock equivalents,  which
                    consist   of  shares  subject  to  stock  options
                    computed  using  the treasury stock  method.   In
                    addition,  dilutive  convertible  securities  are
                    included  in  the denominator while  interest  on
                    convertible  debt, net of tax, is added  back  to
                    the  numerator.  On January 25, 2001, the Company
                    announced  a  2-for-1 common stock split  payable
                    as  a  stock  dividend on February  23,  2001  to
                    shareholders of record on February 9, 2001.   All
                    share  and income per share information has  been
                    adjusted  for all years presented to reflect  the
                    stock split.

                   A  reconciliation of the numerator and denominator
                   used  in  computing income per share is as follows

                    have  been reclassified to conform to the  current
                    year presentation.

              (r)   Interest Rate Hedges


                    The  Company has periodically used swaps to  hedge
                    the  effects  of  fluctuations in  interest  rates
                    associated   with   aircraft   financings.   These
                    transactions  meet  the requirements  for  current
                    hedge  accounting.   The  effective  portions   of
                    hedging  gains  and  losses  resulting  from   the
                    interest  rate  swap contracts are deferred  until
                    the  contracts are settled and then amortized over
                    the aircraft lease term or capitalized as part  of
                    acquisition  cost, if purchased,  and  depreciated
                    over  the  life of the aircraft.  The  ineffective
                    portions  of hedging gains and losses are recorded
                    as incurred.

              (s)   Segment Information

                    The    Company   has   adopted   SFAS   No.   131,
                    "Disclosures  About Segments of an Enterprise  and
                    Related   Information."   The  statement  requires
                    disclosures  related to components  of  a  company
                    for   which  separate  financial  information   is
                    available  that  is  evaluated  regularly   by   a
                    company's  chief  operating  decision   maker   in
                    deciding   the   allocation   of   resources   and
                    assessing  performance.   The Company  is  engaged
                    in   one  line  of  business,  the  scheduled  and
                    chartered  transportation  of  passengers,   which
                    constitutes nearly all of its operating revenues.

4.  Debt        On  September 28, 2001, the Company entered into  an
                asset-based  lending  agreement  with  a   financial
                institution  that provided the Company with  a  line
                of  credit for up to $25 million.  The new  line  of
                credit,  which  will  expire on  October  15,  2003,
                replaced  a  previous $35 million  line  of  credit.
                The  interest rate on this line is LIBOR plus  .875%
                to  1.375% depending on the Company's fixed  charges
                coverage  ratio.   As  of  December  31,  2001,  the
                Company's  interest rate on its line of  credit  was
                3.0%.   The  Company has pledged  $15.3  million  of
                this  line  of credit as collateral for  letters  of
                credit  issued  on  behalf  of  the  Company  by   a
                financial   institution.   The  available  borrowing
                under the line of credit is limited to the value  of
                the  bond letter of credit on the Company's  Dulles,
                Virginia  hangar facility plus the value of  60%  of
                the  book value of certain rotable spare parts.   As
                of  December 31, 2001 the amount of available credit
                under  the  line was $9.7 million.  As  of  December
                31,  2001  there were no outstanding  borrowings  on
                the $25 million line of credit.

                In  July  1997,  the Company issued  $57.5  million
                aggregate   principal  amount  of  7%   Convertible
                Subordinated Notes due July 1, 2004 ("the  Notes").
                The  Notes  were convertible into shares of  Common
                Stock unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at
                a  conversion price of $4.50 per share, subject  to
                certain  adjustments.  During  1998,  approximately
                $37.7  million  of  the notes were  converted  into
                approximately  8.5 million shares of common  stock.
                Interest  on the Notes was payable on April  1  and
                October  1  of  each year.  On May  15,  2000,  the
                Company   called   the  remaining   $19.8   million
                principal   amount   of  Notes   outstanding,   for
                redemption at 104% of face value effective July  3,
                2000.   The Noteholders elected to convert  all  of
                the  Notes into common stock and approximately  4.4
                million  shares  were issued in  exchange  for  the
                Notes  during the period May 25, 2000  to  June  6,
                2000,  resulting in an addition to paid in  capital
                of  approximately $19.8 million partially offset by
                a  reduction  of  approximately  $471,000  for  the
                unamortized  debt issuance costs  relating  to  the
                Notes in connection with their conversion.
                <PAGE> 63
                In  September 1997, approximately $112  million  of
                pass  through certificates were issued in a private
                placement  by  separate pass through trusts,  which
                purchased  with the proceeds, equipment notes  (the
                "Equipment  Notes") issued in connection  with  (i)
                leveraged lease transactions relating to four J-41s
                and  six  CRJs,  all of which were  leased  to  the
                Company  (the  "Leased  Aircraft"),  and  (ii)  the
                financing  of four J-41s owned by the Company  (the
                "Owned Aircraft").  The Equipment Notes issued with
                respect   to   the   Owned  Aircraft   are   direct
                obligations  of  ACA, guaranteed by  ACAI  and  are
                included  as  debt obligations in the  accompanying
                consolidated  financial statements.  The  Equipment
                Notes  issued  with respect to the Leased  Aircraft
                are not obligations of ACA or guaranteed by ACAI.

7.  Stockholders'  Stock Splits
       Equity
                On  January 25, 2001, the Company announced a 2-for-1
                common  stock  split payable as a stock  dividend  on
                February  23,  2001  to  shareholders  of  record  on
                February 9, 2001.  The effect of this stock split  is
                reflected  in the accompanying financial  statements,
                calculation  of  income per share, and  stock  option
                table  presented below as of and for the years  ended
                December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001.

                Stock Option Plans

                The  Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan has 3.0 million
                shares of which a majority had been granted by  1995.
                The  Company's  1995  Stock Incentive  Plan  has  5.0
                million shares of which the majority had been granted
                by   year-end   1999.    In   2000,   the   Company's
                shareholders approved a new 2000 Stock Incentive Plan
                for  4.0  million  shares.  These  three  shareholder
                approved  plans provide for the issuance of incentive
                stock  and  non qualified stock options  to  purchase
                common  stock  of  the Company and  restricted  stock
                awards  to  certain employees and  directors  of  the
                Company. In addition, during 2000 the Company's Board
                of  Directors approved stock option programs  for  an
                additional  2.4  million shares. The  Board  approved
                programs  provide  for the issuance of  non-qualified
                stock options to purchase common stock of the Company
                and  restricted  stock awards to  certain  employees.
                Executive  officers and directors of the Company  are
                not  eligible to participate in the Board  authorized
                stock option programs.  Under the plans and programs,
                options are granted by the Chief Executive Officer of
                the  Company  with  approval  from  the  Compensation
                Committee of the Board of Directors and vest  over  a
                period ranging from three to five years.

                The  Company  awarded  a total of  55,900  shares  of
                restricted  stock to certain employees  during  2001.
                These  shares  vest  over  four  years  and  have   a
                provision  for  accelerated vesting  tied  to  a  25%
                increase in any 2002 quarter's operating results over
                the  prior  years  quarter.  The  Company  recognized
                $218,000 in compensation expense in 2001 due to these
                restricted stock awards.  The Company awarded a total
                of  67,000  shares  of restricted  stock  to  certain
                employees during 2000.  These shares vest over  three
                years and had a provision for accelerated vesting  if
                the  Company's stock price appreciated by 25%  during
                the  first  year of vesting.  In February  2001,  the
                Company's   stock   price  met  the   threshold   for
                accelerated vesting and as a result, these restricted
                shares  vested  100%  in  April  2001.   The  Company
                recognized  $1.1 million and $78,000 in  compensation
                expense in 2001 and 2000, respectively, due to  these
                restricted  stock  awards and  as  a  result  of  the
                accelerated  vesting schedule.  In 1998, the  Company
                awarded a total of 200,000 shares of restricted stock
                to  certain employees.  These shares vest over  three
                to  five  years.   The  Company recognized  $343,000,
                $301,000  and  $241,000 in compensation  expense  for
                1999, 2000 and 2001 respectively, associated with the
                1998 restricted stock awards and $94,000, $90,000 and
                $57,000   for   1999,  2000  and  2001  respectively,
                associated with stock option awards.

                The  Company uses the Black-Scholes option  model  to
                estimate  the  fair  value of  options.  A  risk-free
                interest  rate of 6.6%, 6.0% and 4.5% for 1999,  2000
                and 2001, respectively, a volatility rate of 65%, 65%
                and 73.4% for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, with
                an expected life of 6.7 years for 1999, 4.0 years for
                2000   and  4.0  years  for  2001  were  assumed   in
                estimating  the  fair value.  No  dividend  rate  was
                assumed for any of the years.

                The   following  summarizes  the  pro  forma  effects

8.  Employee    Employee Stock Ownership Plan
    Benefit
    Plans       The  Company  established an Employee Stock  Ownership
                Plan   (the   "ESOP")   covering   substantially   all
                employees.  For each of the years 1992  through  1995,
                the  Company made contributions to the ESOP that  were
                used  in  part  to  make loan and  interest  payments.
                Shares  of  common  stock acquired by  the  ESOP  were
                allocated  to  each employee based on  the  employee's
                annual compensation.

                Effective June 1, 1998, the Board of Directors of the
                Company  voted to terminate the Plan.  On  March  15,
                1999,   the   Internal  Revenue  Service   issued   a
                determination letter notifying the Company  that  the
                termination of the Plan does not adversely affect the
                Plan's  qualification for federal tax purposes.  Upon
                termination  of the Plan, a participant becomes  100%
                vested  in his or her account. In preparing  for  the
                final distribution of ESOP shares to participants, it
                was  determined that a misallocation  of  shares  had
                occurred  in  years  1993 through 1997  resulting  in
                certain  eligible participants not receiving some  of
                their  entitled  shares. The Company contributed  the
                required  number  of additional shares  to  the  ESOP
                during the second and third quarters of 1999 when the
                final   calculation  was  determined  and  recognized
                approximately $250,000 in expense. The Company  filed
                a  request for a compliance statement under the IRS's
                Voluntary  Compliance Resolution  Program  to  obtain
                Service  approval of the Company's  response  to  the
                share  misallocation  issue. In September  1999,  the
                ESOP  trustee began distribution of the  ESOP  assets
                per   participant's  direction.  In  2000  and  2001,
                additional   ESOP   shares   were   distributed,   as
                participants  were located.  The ESOP  will  continue
                until  all participants are located and any remaining
                assets  are  properly  distributed.   The  number  of
                shares remaining in the Plan as of December 31,  2000
                and 2001 were 29,074 and 14,537, respectively.
                <PAGE> 69
                401K Plan

                Effective  January  1,  1992, the  Company  adopted  a
                401(k)    Plan   (the   "Plan").   The   Plan   covers
                substantially  all full-time employees  who  meet  the
                Plan's  eligibility requirements. Employees may  elect
                a  salary reduction contribution of up to 15% of their
                annual  compensation not to exceed the maximum  amount
                allowed by the Internal Revenue Service.

                Effective  October 1, 1994, the Plan was  amended  to
                require the Company to make contributions to the Plan
                for   eligible   pilots  in  exchange   for   certain
                concessions.   These contributions are in  excess  of
                any  discretionary contributions made for the  pilots
                under   the  original  terms  of  the  Plan.    These
                contributions are 100% vested and equal to 3% of  the
                first  $15,000 of each eligible pilot's  compensation
                plus  2%  of  compensation in excess of $15,000.  The
                Plan  limits  the  Company's  contributions  for  the
                pilots  to  15% of the Company's adjusted net  income
                before  extraordinary items for such plan  year.  The
                Company's  obligations  to  make  contributions  with
                respect  to  all  plan  years in  the  aggregate  are
                limited  to  $2.5 million.  The employer's  aggregate
                contribution as of December 31, 1999 was $2,500,000.

                The  Plan  allows  the Company to  make  discretionary
                matching   contributions  for   non-union   employees,
                mechanics,  and  certain flight attendants,  equal  to
                25%   of  salary  contributions  up  to  4%  of  total
                compensation.  Effective with the ratification of  the
                pilot's  new union agreement on February 9, 2001,  the
                Company's match for pilots is variable depending  upon
                the  pilot's  length  of  service  and  the  Company's
                operational   performance.   The  Company's   matching
                percentage  for a pilot can range from  one  to  seven
                percent  of  eligible  contributions.   The  Company's
                matching contribution for all qualified employees,  if
                any,  vests  ratably  over five  years.   Contribution
                expense was approximately $303,000, $374,000 and  $3.9
                million  for  1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.   The
                Company's   contribution  expense  in  2001   includes
                estimated   costs  of  $2.9  million  for   additional
                contributions to correct operational defects found  in
                the  Company's 401(k) plan in addition to  $1  million
                in discretionary matching contributions.

                Profit Sharing Programs

                The  Company  has profit sharing programs that  result
                in   periodic  payments  to  all  eligible  employees.
                Profit   sharing  compensation,  which  is  based   on
                attainment   of  certain  performance  and   financial
                goals,  was approximately $4.5 million, $4.5  million,
                and   $6.3   million   in   1999,   2000   and   2001,
                respectively.

                in  different  periods  than for  financial  reporting
                purposes.  The Company's 2000 effective tax  rate  was
                positively  affected  by the receipt  of  a  favorable
                ruling  request  which allowed the Company  to  obtain
                additional  tax credits to offset income tax  as  well
                as  the realization of certain tax benefits that  were
                previously reserved which together reduced income  tax
                expense by approximately $1.4 million.

   Commitments
   and           As  of December 31, 2001, the Company had a total of
                 39  Canadair  Regional Jets ("CRJs") on  order  from
   Contingencies Bombardier,   Inc.,   and  held   options   for   80
                 additional CRJs.  The Company also had a firm  order
                 with  Fairchild Dornier for 36 Fairchild Dornier  32
                 seat  regional jets ("328JET") aircraft, and options
                 for  81 additional 328JETs.  Of the 75 firm aircraft
                 deliveries,  33 are scheduled for 2002  and  42  are
                 scheduled  for  2003.  The Company is  obligated  to
                 purchase  and  finance (including leveraged  leases)
                 the  75  firm  ordered aircraft  at  an  approximate
                 capital   cost   of  $1.2  billion.    The   Company
                 anticipates  leasing the majority of its  year  2002
                 aircraft  deliveries on terms similar to  previously
                 delivered regional jet aircraft.

                 Post Retirement Benefits

                 The  Company  has  committed to  provide  its senior
                 executive  officers a  deferred  compensation   plan
                 which utilizes split dollar life insurance policies,
                 and for a certain officer, a make-whole provision for
                 taxes, post retirement salary based on ending salary,
                 and post retirement benefits based on benefits similar
                 to  those currently provided to the executive  while
                 actively  employed.  The Company has  estimated  the
                 cost  of the deferred compensation and tax gross  up
                 feature,  future salary and future benefits  and  is
                 accruing  this  cost  over  the  remaining  required
                 service  time  of the executive officers.   In  2001,
                 the  Company expensed approximately $1.8 million  as
                 the  current  year's  cost of these  benefits.   The
                 company  expects to recognize similar costs annually
                 over  the  remaining  service  life  of  the  senior
                 executives.



                 Training

                 The Company has entered into agreements with Pan  Am
                 International Flight Academy ("PAIFA"), which  allow
                 the Company to train CRJ, J-41 and 328JET pilots  at
                 PAIFA's  facility near Washington-Dulles.  In  2001,
                 PAIFA relocated its Washington-Dulles operations  to
                 a  new training facility housing two CRJ simulators,
                 a  328JET  simulator, and a J-41 simulator near  the
                 Company's   Washington-Dulles   headquarters.    The
                 Company   has  agreements  to  purchase  an   annual
                 minimum  number  of CRJ and J-41 simulator  training
                 hours  at  agreed rates, through 2010 for  the  CRJ,
                 and  2002  for  the  J-41.   The  Company's  payment
                 obligations  for CRJ and J-41 simulator  usage  over
                 the   remaining   years  of  the  agreements   total
                 approximately $12.5 million.
                 <PAGE> 73
                 In   2001,   a   simulator  provision  and   service
                 agreement  between  PAIFA,  CAE  Schreiner  and  the
                 Company  was executed and 328JET training  commenced
                 at  the  PAIFA facility.  Under this agreement,  the
                 Company has committed to purchase all of its  328JET
                 simulator  time  from PAIFA at  agreed  upon  rates,
                 with   no   minimum   number  of   simulator   hours
                 guaranteed.  A second 328JET simulator is  scheduled
                 for  installation  at  the  Washington-Dulles  PAIFA
                 simulator facility in July 2002.

                 At  December 31, 2001, the Company's minimum payment
                 obligations under the PAIFA agreements for  the  CRJ
                 and J-41 simulators are as follows:

                 Derivative Financial Instruments

                 The  Company has periodically entered into a  series
                 of  put and call contracts as an interest rate hedge
                 designed  to  limit its exposure  to  interest  rate
                 changes  on  the anticipated issuance  of  permanent
                 financing  relating  to  the  delivery  of  the  CRJ
                 aircraft.   During 1999, 2000 and 2001, the  Company
                 settled  seven,  eight and one  hedge  transactions,
                 respectively,    receiving   $119,000    from    the
                 counterparty   in  1999,  paying  the   counterparty
                 $379,000   in   2000  and  paying  the  counterparty
                 $722,000  in 2001.  In 1999, the Company  recognized
                 a   gain  of  $211,000  on  the  settlement  of  one
                 contract, representing the ineffective portion of  a
                 hedge.   At  December 31, 2000 the Company  had  one
                 interest   rate  hedge  transaction  open   with   a
                 notional  value  of  $8.5 million.   It  settled  on
                 January  3,  2001 resulting in the  payment  to  the
                 counterparty referenced above.

                 In  October 1999, the Company entered into commodity
                 swap   transactions  to  hedge  price   changes   on
                 approximately 13,300 barrels of crude oil per  month
                 for   the  period  April  to  June  2000,   and   on
                 approximately 23,300 barrels of crude oil per  month
                 for  the  period July through September  2000.   The
                 contracts provided for an average fixed price  equal
                 to  approximately  52.6 cents  per  gallon  for  the
                 second  quarter of 2000 and 51 cents per gallon  for
                 the third quarter of 2000.    Effective December  1,
                 2000,  under  the  United Air Lines  agreements  and
                 since  inception of the Delta Air Lines  agreements,
                 the  Company  no  longer bears the  risk  associated
                 with  fuel  price  volatility  for  its  operations.
                 Accordingly,  no  fuel  hedging  transactions   were
                 entered  for  2001, and there were no  fuel  hedging
                 transactions open as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

   Retirement    $23.5  million  ($14.0 million after  tax)  for  the
   Charge        early   retirement   of  nine  leased   Jetstream-41
                 turboprop   aircraft  that  will  be  removed   from
                 service   prior  to  year-end  2002.   The   Company
                 anticipates  taking additional charges  during  2002
                 of  approximately $48 million pre-tax ($28.4 million
                 after-tax)  for the retirement of its remaining  29-
                 seat   Jetstream-41  turboprop  aircraft  in   2003.
                 Fairchild Dornier, the manufacturer of the  328JETs,
                 is  contractually  obligated  to  make  the  Company
                 whole for any difference between lease payments,  if
                 any,  received from remarketing the 26 J-41 aircraft
                 leased   by  the  Company  and  the  lease   payment
                 obligations  of the Company on those  aircraft.   To
                 the  extent  that  Fairchild  Dornier  fulfills  its
                 contractual   obligations,  the  majority   of   the
                 aircraft  early retirement charge will not adversely
                 affect   the  Company's  cash  position,  with   the
                 payments by Fairchild Dornier being recorded  as  an
                 aircraft   purchase   inducement   on   the   328JET
                 aircraft.      The   undiscounted  remaining   lease
                 obligations  (net  of  the  Company's  estimate   of
                 future  sublease  rentals) on the J-41  fleet  after
                 planned  retirement  dates  in  2002  and  2003  are
                 approximately  $55  million  and  continue   through
                 2010.   The  Company would remain liable  for  these
                 lease  payments in the event that Fairchild  Dornier
                 defaults  on  its obligation.  No  asset  impairment
                 charges were included in the aircraft early retirement
                 charge.

                 During  2000,  the Company recorded  aircraft  early
                 retirement  operating charges totaling  $29  million
                 ($17.4  million  net of income tax)  for  the  early
                 lease  termination  of its 28 19-seat  Jetstream  32
                 turboprop aircraft, which were removed from  service
                 prior  to  December 31, 2001.  The  charge  included
                 the  estimated  cost of contractual  obligations  to
                 meet  aircraft return conditions, as well as a lease
                 termination fee, which fee was calculated  including
                 such  factors as the discounted present  value  cost
                 of  future lease obligations from the planned out of
                 service  date  to  the lease termination  date,  and
                 miscellaneous costs and benefits of early return  to
                 the  lessor.    As a result of completing  the  J-32
                 early  retirement during the fourth quarter of 2001,
                 the  Company reversed approximately $500,000 of  the
                 original  $29  million  charge  which  will  not  be
                 required,  and recorded this amount as  a  reduction
                 to  the  aircraft early retirement charge  taken  in
                 2001.

12.  Air          On  September 22, 2001, President Bush signed  into
   Transportation law   the  Air  Transportation  Safety  and  System
   Safety and     Stabilization  Act (the "Act").  The  Act  provided
   System         cash   grants   to  commercial  air   carriers   as
   Stabilization  compensation  for direct losses incurred  beginning
   Act/Aviation   with  the  terrorist attacks on September 11,  2001
   and            as  a  result of the FAA mandated ground stop order
   Transportation issued by the Secretary of Transportation, and  for
   Security Act   incremental  losses  incurred  during  the   period
                  beginning  September 11, 2001 and  ending  December
                  31,  2001 as a direct result of such attacks.   The
                  Company  has  received $9.7 million in cash  grants
                  under  these provisions recognized as non-operating
                  income  under  "government  compensation"  for  the
                  third  and  fourth quarters 2001.  This amount  was
                  the  government's estimate of approximately 85%  of
                  amount  due  to  the Company based  on  preliminary
                  data.    The   exact   amount  of   the   Company's
                  compensation will be based on the lesser of  actual
                  losses  incurred or a statutory limit based on  the
                  total  amount  allocable  to  all  airlines.   This
                  exact  amount is not yet determinable  because  the
                  statutory limit is subject to information  not  yet
                  released  by the federal government.  As such,  the
                  Company  is  unsure if it will be entitled  to  any
                  further  government compensation under this program
                  and  will recognize any remaining payments as  non-
                  operating   income   during  the   period   it   is
                  determined   the  Company  is  entitled   to   such
                  amounts.     All  amounts  received  as  government
                  compensation  are subject to audit  and  adjustment
                  by the federal government.

                  In  addition  to the Compensation described  above,
                  the  Act:  provides  U.S.  air  carriers  with  the
                  option  to  purchase  certain  war  risk  liability
                  insurance from the United States government  on  an
                  interim  basis  at  rates that are  more  favorable
                  than  those  available  from  the  private  market;
                  authorizes the federal government to reimburse  air
                  carriers  for  the  increased  cost  of  war   risk
                  insurance  premiums for a limited but  undetermined
                  period  of  time  as  a  result  of  the  terrorist
                  attacks of September 11, 2001; and, authorizes  the
                  federal  government, pursuant to  new  regulations,
                  to  provide  loan  guarantees to air  carriers   in
                  the     aggregate    amount   of    $10    billion.
                  Subsequently   the   government   authorized    air
                  carriers to apply for reimbursement under  the  Act
                  for  increased insurance costs incurred during  the
                  period  October 1, 2001 to October  30,  2001,  and
                  the  Company applied for received, and booked as  a
                  reduction  to  insurance expense $652,000  in  such
                  reimbursements.   This amount was  based  on  costs
                  incurred  during the period, and no other insurance
                  reimbursements  are  anticipated.   Finally,   with
                  respect  to  federal loan guarantees,  the  Company
                  continues  to  evaluate the  terms  and  conditions
                  being  imposed by the government, and has  not  yet
                  determined  whether  to make  application  for  any
                  such facility.

                  Following  the September 11 terrorist attacks,  the
                  aviation  insurance  industry imposed  a  worldwide
                  surcharge on aviation insurance rates as well as  a
                  reduction in coverage for certain war risks.     In
                  response  to  the  reduction in coverage,  the  Air
                  Transportation Safety and System Stabilization  Act
                  provided  U.S.  air  carriers with  the  option  to
                  purchase certain war risk liability insurance  from
                  the  United  States government on an interim  basis
                  at   rates  that  are  more  favorable  than  those
                  available  from the private market.    The  Company
                  has  purchased this coverage through May  19,  2002
                  and  anticipates renewing it for  as  long  as  the
                  coverage  is  available from the  U.S.  government.
                  The  airlines and insurance industry, together with
                  the   United  States  and  other  governments,  are
                  continuing  to evaluate both the cost  and  options
                  for   providing  coverage  of  aviation  insurance.
                  Recently,   an  industry-led  group   announced   a
                  proposal  to create a mutual insurance company,  to
                  be   called  Equitime,  to  cover  war   risk   and
                  terrorism risk, which would initially seek  support
                  through  government  guarantees.   Equitime   would
                  provide  a  competitive  alternative  to  insurance
                  being  offered by the traditional insurance market,
                  which    opposes   this   initiative.    Equitime's
                  organizers  project  that it may  be  available  to
                  provide insurance as early as May 2002 to up to  70
                  U.S.  carriers.  The Company has not been  actively
                  involved  in  the  formation  of  Equitime  and  is
                  unable   to  anticipate  whether  this  source   of
                  insurance  will  be  made  available  and,  if  so,
                  whether  it  will  offer  competitive  rates.   The
                  Company  anticipates that it will  follow  industry
                  practices with respect to sources of insurance.

                  On  November 19, 2001 the President signed into law
                  the  Aviation and Transportation Security Act  (the
                  "Security   Act").   The  Security   Act   requires
                  heightened  passenger, baggage and  cargo  security
                  measures  be  adopted as well as  enhanced  airport
                  security procedures.  The Security Act created  the
                  Transportation   Security  Administration   ("TSA")
                  that  has  taken  over from the  air  carriers  the
                  reasonability  for  conducting  the  screening   of
                  passengers  and  their baggage.   The  TSA  assumed
                  both   of   the   Company's   passenger   screening
                  contracts  on  February  17,  2002.   Air  carriers
                  continue   to  have  responsibility  for   aircraft
                  security, employee background checks, the  security
                  of   air  carrier  airport  facilities  and   other
                  security related functions.
                  <PAGE> 77
                  The  activities of the TSA are to be funded in part
                  by   the  application  of  a  $2.50  per  passenger
                  enplanement security fee (subject to a  maximum  of
                  $5.00  per  one  way  trip)  and  payment  by   all
                  passenger  carriers  of a sum  not  exceeding  each
                  carrier's  passenger  and  baggage  screening  cost
                  incurred  in  calendar  year  2000.   The  TSA   is
                  charged  to have equipment in operation by the  end
                  of  2002  to  be able to electronically screen  all
                  checked  passenger baggage with explosive detection
                  systems.   The  TSA  is  also  required  to  deploy
                  federal  air  marshals on an  increased  number  of
                  passenger  flights.  The Security Act  imposes  new
                  and   increased   requirements  for   air   carrier
                  employee  background checks and additional security
                  training   of  flight  and  cabin  crew  personnel.
                  These  additional and new requirements may increase
                  the  security  related costs of the  Company.   The
                  Security Act also mandated and the FAA has  adopted
                  new  rules  requiring the strengthening of  cockpit
                  doors,   some  of  the  costs  of  which   may   be
                  reimbursed  by the FAA.  The Company has  completed
                  level  one  fortification if its cockpit  doors  on
                  all  of its aircraft as of November 15, 2001.   The
                  FAA    has   mandated   additional   cockpit   door
                  modifications   that  will  result  in   additional
                  costs.    The   Company  intends   to   apply   for
                  reimbursement  of  these costs and  other  security
                  costs  for  which  the FAA has established  a  cost
                  reimbursement  program. There is no guarantee  that
                  the  Company  will be reimbursed in  full  for  the
                  cost  of  these  modifications. New  passenger  and
                  baggage   screening   requirements   have    caused
                  disruptions  in  the  flow  of  passengers  through
                  airports   and   in  some  cases  delayed   airline
                  operations.   The Company may experience  security-
                  related   disruptions  in  the  future,   including
                  reduced  passenger  demand  for  air  travel,   but
                  believes  that its exposure to such disruptions  is
                  not  greater than that faced by other providers  of
                  regional air carrier services.


13.  Subsequent  In  the  first quarter of 2002, the Company expanded
   Events        its  charter operations by ordering three additional
                 328JET  aircraft  from Fairchild  Dornier.   One  of
                 these,   which   has  already  been  acquired,   was
                 purchased   through  the  application   of   certain
                 deposits  previously placed with Fairchild  Dornier,
                 and  the others will be financed through debt,  with
                 repayment over approximately ten years.



 14.  Litigation The Company is a party to routine litigation and  to
                 FAA  civil  action  proceedings, all  of  which  are
                 incidental  to its business, and none of  which  the
                 Company  believes  are likely  to  have  a  material
                 effect  on the Company's financial position  or  the
                 results of its operations.

   17.  Recent
   Accounting
   Pronouncement  On  July 5, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
   s              Board   issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
                  Standard  No.  141,   "Business  Combinations",  and
                  Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.  142,
                  "Goodwill  and Other Intangible Assets".   Statement
                  No. 141 addresses the accounting for acquisitions of
                  businesses   and   is  effective  for   acquisitions
                  occurring  on or after July 1, 2001.  Statement  No.
                  142  includes  requirements  to  test  goodwill  and
                  indefinite  life  intangible assets  for  impairment
                  rather than amortize them. Statement No. 142 will be
                  effective for fiscal years beginning after  December
                  15,  2001.  The Company will adopt Statement No. 142
                  beginning in the first quarter of 2002. The  Company
                  anticipates that implementation of SFAS 141 and SFAS
                  142  will  have  minimal  impact  on  the  Company's
                  financial position or results of operations.

                  On   October   3,  2001,  the  Financial  Accounting
                  Standards  Board  issued  FASB  Statement  No.  144,
                  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal  of  Long-
                  Lived  Assets, which addresses financial  accounting
                  and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-
                  lived  assets.   Statement No. 144  supersedes  FASB
                  Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment  of
                  Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets  to  Be
                  Disposed  Of  and APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting  the
                  Results  of  Operations-Reporting  the  Effects   of
                  Disposal   of   a   Segment  of  a   Business,   and
                  Extraordinary,  Unusual  and Infrequently  Occurring
                  Events and Transactions.  Statement No. 144 includes
                  requirements related to the classification of assets
                  as held for sale, including the establishment of six
                  criteria  that  must  be  satisfied  prior  to  this
                  classification.   Statement No.  144  also  includes
                  guidance  related to the recognition and calculation
                  of   impairment   losses  for   long-lived   assets.
                  Statement No. 144 will be effective for fiscal years
                  beginning after December 15, 2001.  The Company will
                  adopt  Statement  No.  144 beginning  in  the  first
                  quarter of 2002.  Statement No. 144 is projected  to
                  have  minimal  impact  on  the  Company's  financial
                  position or results of operations.

Exhibit 10.12(b)


            AMENDED AND RESTATED SEVERANCE AGREEMENT



          This  Amended  And  Restated Severance  Agreement  (the
"Agreement")  is  made and entered into as of this  28th  day  of
December,  2001  (the "Effective Date"), by and between  ATLANTIC
COAST  AIRLINES  HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation  ("ACAH")
and  ATLANTIC  COAST  AIRLINES, a California corporation  ("ACA")
(ACAH  and  ACA  are  herein  collectively  referred  to  as  the
"Company") and THOMAS J. MOORE ("Moore").

          Witnesseth That:

          Whereas, Moore is currently employed by the Company  as
Chief  Operating  Officer and President, and in  connection  with
such employment entered into a Severance Agreement (last restated
as of December 28, 1999) with the Company; and

          Whereas,  the  Company wishes to assure itself  of  the
continued services of Moore; and

          Whereas,  the  Board of Directors of  the  Company  has
determined that the best interests of the Company would be served
by entering into this amended and restated Agreement with Moore;

          Now,  Therefore, the parties, for and in  consideration
of the mutual and reciprocal covenants and agreements hereinafter
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, do  contract
and agree as follows:

          1.   Employment. Company hereby employs Moore and Moore
hereby  accepts employment by Company and agrees to  perform  his
duties  and responsibilities hereunder upon all of the terms  and
conditions as are hereinafter set forth.

          2.    Duties.  Moore  shall serve the  Company  in  the
capacities of Chief Operating Officer and President.  Moore shall
be  responsible for supervising and directing all  operations  of
the  Company and of any other entity(ies) to which the  Company's
obligations  under this Agreement shall be assigned  pursuant  to
Paragraph 12.  Moore shall otherwise be responsible for  carrying
out   all   such  other  duties  and  services  for  the  Company
commensurate with Moore's position, as may be designed from  time
to  time  by  the  Chief Executive Officer of  the  Company  (the
"CEO").

          3.   Term  of  Employment.  Moore's term of  employment
under  this  Restated Agreement shall commence on  the  Effective
Date  and  shall terminate on the last day of the calendar  month
which  is  twelve (12) calendar months after the Effective  Date,
unless further extended as hereinafter set forth.  Commencing  on
each  successive anniversary of the Effective Date, the Agreement
shall  automatically  be extended for an additional  twelve  (12)
months  without  further action by either  party  unless  Moore's
employment has previously been terminated or unless Moore or  the
Company  has  provided notice of intention to  terminate  Moore's
employment pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 10 below, in  which
case  Moore's  term  of employment under this Agreement  will  be
extended to the pending Termination Date.

          4.   Extent  of Service.  Moore shall devote such  time
and  attention  as  is required to perform his obligations  under
this   Agreement   and   will  at  all   times   faithfully   and
industriously,  consistent  with  his  ability,  experience   and
talent, perform his duties hereunder under the direction  of  the
CEO.

          5.   Compensation  During the term of this  Agreement.
Company  agrees to pay to Moore, and Moore agrees to accept  from
Company, in full payment for services rendered by Moore and  work
to  be  performed by him under the terms of this  Agreement,  the
following:

                A.    Salary.   An  annual base  salary  of  [Two
Hundred  Fifty  Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000)].   Commencing   on
October  1, 2002 and on each October 1 thereafter, the amount  of
Moore's  base  salary  shall be increased as  determined  by  the
Compensation  Committeeof the Board of Directors of  the  Company
(the  "Compensation Committee").  Moore's base  salary  for  each
year  shall  be payable to him in accordance with the  reasonable
payroll  practices of the Company as from time to time in  effect
for  executive  employees  (but  in  no  event  less  often  than
monthly).

                B.    Management  Incentive  Plan.   Moore  shall
participate in the Company's Management Incentive Program, or any
successor bonus plan or program for management employees.

                C.    Executive Bonuses.  Moore shall be eligible
for  an  additional  annual bonus under an executive  performance
bonus  plan  currently known as Senior Management Incentive  Plan
("SMIP")  for  so  long as the Board of Directors  determines  to
maintain  such plan.  Under such plan, each calendar year,  Moore
shall  be  entitled  to  receive a bonus  equal  to  a  specified
percentage  of  base salary upon the attainment of  certain  pre-
established goals.  Such goals and percentage of salary shall  be
determined   by   the  Compensation  Committee   prior   to   the
commencement of each plan year.  The bonus amount each year shall
be  paid  in  cash,  stock, options or such  other  form  as  the
Compensation Committee provides, paid at the time period provided
under  such plan, at the same time and in the same form  as  paid
generally to other eligible employees, except to the extent  that
this Agreement provides otherwise.

               D.   Deferred Compensation.

                 (i)    Moore   will  be  entitled  to   deferred
compensation under an unfunded and non-tax qualified  arrangement
("Deferred  Compensation") as described in this  Paragraph  5.D.,
which  shall  supercede  and  control  over  all  prior  deferred
compensation  arrangements.   The amounts  credited  as  Deferred
Compensation will be recorded as a bookkeeping entry representing
a general unsecured obligation of the Company and Moore shall not
have   a  claim  to  any  specific  assets  of  the  Company   in
satisfaction  of  the  amounts,  if  any,  payable  as   Deferred
Compensation.   As  of the Effective Date,  the  balance  in  the
Deferred  Compensation  account recorded for  Moore  shall  equal
$__________,  which  is  the  amount of  the  Company's  Deferred
Compensation   "contributions"  under  the  Severance   Agreement
between  the Company and Moore, as such was amended from time  to
time, through the Effective Date.  After the Effective Date,  the
Company will credit Deferred Compensation  at the  rate of  one
hundred percent (100%) of Moore's annual base salary.   Deferred
Compensation  will  be  based on Moore's annual  base  salary  in
effect  on  January 1 in each year, and will be  credited  as  of
January  1  in  each year.  The Company may provide the  Deferred
Compensation  through a benefit plan so long as  (1)  the  amount
credited  by the Company on Moore's behalf equals the amount  set
forth  herein, and (2) the vesting schedule, credit for Years  of
Service,  and terms of distribution are all at least as favorable
to  Moore as set forth herein.  No interest or rate of return  or
other  appreciation or depreciation of value shall accrue  or  be
payable  on  amounts  credited to Moore as Deferred  Compensation
pursuant  to  this  Paragraph  5.D.  unless  the  Company  elects
otherwise.

                (ii)  Vesting  of Deferred Compensation  will  be
based upon "Years of Service," with Moore to be credited with one
Year  of  Service for completion of each twelve (12)  consecutive
month period of employment with the Company beginning January  1,
1997  and  ending  on the Deferred Compensation Ending  Date  (as
defined  below).  (That is, Moore will continue  to  be  credited
with Years of Service during any applicable Severance Period,  as
further  provided  in  Paragraph 10.E.(iv) hereof.)   Moore  will
become vested in the Deferred Compensation based on the following
schedule:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

                                     PERCENTAGE
           YEARS OF SERVICE            VESTED
           <C>                           <C>

             LESS THAN 4                  0%
      AT LEAST 4 BUT LESS THAN 5         25%
      AT LEAST 5 BUT LESS THAN 6         35%
      AT LEAST 6 BUT LESS THAN 7         50%
      AT LEAST 7 BUT LESS THAN 8         65%
      AT LEAST 8 BUT LESS THAN 9         80%
              AT LEAST 9                100%
</TABLE>
In  the  event of a Change in Control (as defined and  determined
under Paragraph 8.C.(ii) of this Agreement) of the Company, Moore
shall become immediately 100% vested in his Deferred Compensation
amount notwithstanding the above vesting schedule.

                (iii)     The "Deferred Compensation Ending Date"
shall  mean  the date of Termination Date (as defined  below)  if
Moore's  employment with the Company is terminated  at  any  time
under   circumstances  that  do  not  entitle  him  to  Severance
Compensation pursuant to Paragraph 10 of this Agreement, or shall
mean  the  last  day  of  the Severance  Period  (as  defined  in
Paragraph  10)  if  Moore is entitled to Severance  Compensation.
During  a  Severance Period, Deferred Compensation shall continue
to  accrue  and vest pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 10.E.(iv)
hereof.   Upon the Deferred Compensation Ending Date, the Company
shall pay to Moore whatever Deferred Compensation amount is equal
to  the  applicable  vested percentage of the total  amount  then
credited  to  his  account pursuant to this Paragraph  5.D.   The
Company  shall make this payment in cash within thirty (30)  days
following  the  Deferred Compensation Ending Date, provided  that
the Company shall have a right of set-off against, and may reduce
the  amount payable as Deferred Compensation by, any amount  owed
or payable by Moore to the Company.

                E.    Split  Dollar Life Insurance.  The  Company
shall  advance  amounts to fund payment of the premiums  under  a
split  dollar  life  insurance  arrangement  covering  Moore   as
provided in this Paragraph 5.E.  As of the date hereof, the split
dollar  life insurance arrangement is provided under a policy  or
policies  with  Phoenix  Home  Life  Mutual  (such  policies  and
agreements  related thereto, the "Split Dollar Agreement").   The
Company shall continue to abide by the terms of the Split  Dollar
Agreement with Moore in force on the date of this Agreement, but,
subject  to the foregoing, the Company may implement a substitute
Split  Dollar Agreement so long as the amount of premiums  funded
by  the  Company  on Moore's behalf equals the amount  set  forth
herein.

                (i)  Moore shall be the owner of the policy under
the  Split  Dollar Agreement and will have the right to designate
his  beneficiary with respect to proceeds of the  policy  payable
upon  his  death;  provided, however,  that  notwithstanding  the
foregoing, the Company shall have a collateral assignment of  the
policy  as security for the repayment of the amounts paid by  the
Company toward the premiums for the policy.

                (ii) The Company shall pay the annual premium due
on  the  policy  in  an amount specified in  this  Agreement,  as
amended from time to time.  From and after the Effective Date,the
amount of the annual premium the Company pays  shall  equal  one
hundred percent (100%) of Moore's annual base salary in effect on
January  1  in  each year the Company is obligated  to  fund  the
premium as described herein.  Provided that Moore remains employed
with the Company  as  of January 1 in a given year, the  Company
shall, except as provided in Paragraph 5.E.(iii) below, for such
year  pay,  on  or before  the due date(s) under the terms of the
policy, the entire amount of the annual premium due on the policy
acquired pursuant to   this  Paragraph  5.E.   During  any
Severance  Period,  the Company's  obligation to pay the annual
premium due on the  split dollar  insurance policy shall continue
pursuant to the terms  of Paragraph 10.E.(v) hereof.

                (iii)      The "Split Dollar Release Date"  shall
mean  (a)  the  Termination Date (as defined below),  if  Moore's
employment  with  the Company is terminated  at  any  time  under
circumstances  that do not entitle him to Severance  Compensation
pursuant  to Paragraph 10 of this Agreement, or (b) the last  day
of the Severance Period (as defined in Paragraph 10), if Moore is
entitled  to  Severance  Compensation.  The  Company  shall  fund
payment of the premiums as provided in the Paragraph 5.E. in each
year  until the Split Dollar Release Date.  Upon the Split Dollar
Release Date, the following shall occur:

                    (a)  Moore shall pay to the Company an amount
equal  to  the total of all premiums paid by the Company  on  the
split dollar policy(ies) acquired pursuant to his employment with
the  Company to the date hereof or subsequently pursuant to  this
Paragraph  5.E., without interest thereon.  The Company  may,  at
its option, collect such amount from any amounts it or any of its
affiliates  owes  to  Moore.  Upon receipt of  such  payment  the
Company  shall release its interest in the policy, or  a  portion
thereof,  on Moore's life acquired pursuant to the terms  of  the
Split  Dollar  Agreement, or any or all of the paid up  additions
standing  to  the credit of such policy, if any,  such  that  the
released  interest equals the total of all premiums paid  by  the
Company on the split dollar policy(ies) acquired pursuant to this
Paragraph  5.E.  The Company agrees that the amount of  any  such
release  of  interest by the Company shall reduce the  amount  of
"Liabilities"  (as  such  term is defined  in  the  Agreement  of
Assignment of Life Insurance Death Benefit As Collateral  entered
into  between Moore and the Company in connection with the  Split
Dollar  Agreement)  owed to the Company in  connection  with  the
Split   Dollar   Agreement  and  related  Collateral   Assignment
Agreement.   Accordingly, the Company also agrees  to  reduce  to
such extent its interest as acquired by collateral assignment  of
the  policy  pursuant to the Split Dollar Agreement  and  related
Collateral Assignment Agreement.

                      (b)    The  Split  Dollar  Agreement  shall
continue in full force and effect and survive separate and  apart
from  this  Agreement; provided, however, that the Company  shall
have no further obligation to pay any premium on the policy under
the  Split Dollar Agreement which has a due date after the  Split
Dollar  Release Date and such obligation shall be transferred  to
Moore.

                F.   Discretionary Compensation.  The Company may
pay  Moore  discretionary compensation, bonuses and  benefits  in
addition to those provided for herein in such amounts and at such
times as the Compensation Committee shall determine.

                G.   Compensation Upon a Change in Control.  Upon
a  Change  in  Control,  whether or not  Moore's  employment  has
terminated,   Moore   shall  receive   all   of   the   following
compensation, paid at the time of the Change in Control:

                     (i)  Salary. A payment in the amount of 300%
of  Moore's  annual  base salary in effect at  the  time  of  the
Change in Control.

                     (ii)  Bonus.  For all bonus plans  in  which
Moore  is  participating as of a Change in Control,  the  Company
shall  pay  to  Moore a lump sum bonus payout. This payout  shall
consist of a payment in the amount calculated by the formula  [(x
+ y) * z] where (x) is Moore's base salary earned in the year from
January 1 to the date of the Change in Control, (y) is the amount
which is three times Moore's annual base salary in effect at  the
time of the Change in Control, and (z) is  the  percentage  which
under each plan is the maximum percentage of base salary that Moore
was  eligible  to  earn during the year in which  the  Change  in
Control  occurred assuming all targets were met in full,  whether
or not said targets actually were met.  The payments provided for
under  this  Paragraph 5.G.(ii) will be paid in cash or  in  such
other  form  as  bonus  amounts generally are  paid  to  eligible
employees,  or  in  a combination thereof, as determined  by  the
Compensation Committee, within thirty days following  the  Change
in  Control  and shall be considered to be full compensation  for
all  amounts  due  to  Moore for bonus  plans  in  which  he  was
participating as of the Change in Control, and he  shall  not  be
entitled  to any further payments under any of said plans  during
the  year of participation.  Notwithstanding the above, any bonus
due  to  Moore  for years (or any other applicable bonus  period)
completed prior to the date in which the Change of Control occurs
but not yet paid shall be paid in addition to the bonus described
herein.

                     (iii)     Disability Insurance.  The Company
will prepay, to the time of Moore's reaching age 65, the premiums
due  on any disability insurance policy as was provided to  Moore
as  of  the  time  of Change in Control.  In the event  that  the
Company  discontinued or reduced the amount of  coverage  of  any
disability  insurance  within one  year  preceding  a  Change  in
Control,  the Company shall at the time of the Change in  Control
re-establish  disability  insurance  to  the  amount   previously
provided  and  with equivalent coverage, and shall prepay  future
premiums as provided herein.


                    (iv) Other Benefits Upon a Change in Control.
Moore shall receive all of the other benefits separately provided
herein  or  in  other agreements as occurring upon  a  Change  in
Control.   These  include vesting of unvested stock  options  and
restricted stock.  In the event a Change in Control occurs, Moore
shall  be entitled to the insurance benefits provided upon Change
in  Control  per Paragraph 10.E.(v) and the travel benefits,  per
Paragraph  10.E.(viii), as provided upon  a  Change  in  Control.
These  benefits will apply at the time of termination of  Moore's
employment, even if Moore's employment is subsequently terminated
in a fashion that does not give rise to Severance Compensation.

                     (v)   Certain Adjustments.   If, as a result
of  payments  provided for under or pursuant  to  this  Agreement
together  with  all other payments in the nature of  compensation
provided to or for the benefit of Moore under any other agreement
in  connection  with  a Change in Control, any  state,  local  or
federal  taxing authority imposes any taxes on Moore  that  would
not  be  imposed  on such payments but for the  occurrence  of  a
Change in Control, including any excise tax under Section 4999 of
the  Internal  Revenue  Code  and  any  successor  or  comparable
provision, then, in addition to any other benefits provided under
or   pursuant  to  this  Agreement  or  otherwise,  the   Company
(including  any successor to the Company) shall pay to  Moore  at
the time any such payments are made under or pursuant to this  or
the  other agreements, an amount equal to the amount of any  such
taxes imposed or to be imposed on Moore  (the amount of any  such
payment,  the  "Parachute Tax Reimbursement").  In addition,  the
Company (including any successor to the Company) shall "gross up"
such  Parachute Tax Reimbursement by paying to Moore at the  same
time  an additional amount equal to the aggregate amount  of  any
additional  taxes  (whether income taxes, excise  taxes,  special
taxes, employment taxes or otherwise) that are or will be payable
by  Moore  as  a result of the Parachute Tax Reimbursement  being
paid  or  payable to Moore and/or as a result of  the  additional
amounts paid or payable to Moore pursuant to this sentence,  such
that after payment of such additional taxes Moore shall have been
paid  on  a  net after-tax basis an amount equal to the Parachute
Tax Reimbursement.  The amount of any Parachute Tax Reimbursement
and  of  any  such  gross-up amounts shall be determined  by  the
Company's independent auditing firm, whose determination,  absent
manifest error, shall be treated as conclusive and binding absent
a binding determination by a governmental taxing authority that a
greater amount of taxes are payable by Moore.

                H.   Employment or Termination Following a Change
in  Control.  Provided that he remains employed and  the  parties
have  not  otherwise agreed to amend this Agreement, following  a
Change in Control Moore's employment shall continue on the  terms
set  forth  in this Agreement and Moore shall remain  subject  to
this  Agreement,  and  be entitled to receive  the  compensation,
payments  and  benefits provided for in this Agreement.   In  the
event  that  Moore's employment is terminated upon or within  one
year  following the Change in Control, such that Moore  would  be
entitled  to Severance Compensation, any amounts due at the  time
of   termination  as  Severance  Compensation  under   Paragraphs
10.E.(i)  and  10.E.(ii) herein shall be reduced by  any  amounts
paid  under Paragraph 5.G.(i) and 5.G.(ii) at the time of  Change
in  Control   (under no circumstances would Moore be required  to
repay  the  amounts  paid  to Moore under  Paragraph  5.G(i)  and
5.G.(ii)),  but  Moore will be entitled to  all  other  Severance
Compensation as provided in Paragraph 10.E. herein.  In the event
that   Moore's  employment  is  terminated  more  than  one  year
following  the Change in Control, Moore will be entitled  to  all
payments  and benefits provided for herein with respect  to  such
termination of employment.

           6.  Benefits.

                A.    The Company shall pay for or provide  Moore
such  vacation time and benefits, including but not  limited  to,
coverage under Company's major medical, accident, health, dental,
disability  and  life insurance plans, as are made  available  to
other  executive  employees of Company  generally  (and,  to  the
extent provided by such policies, to Moore's dependents).

                B.    The  Company  agrees to promptly  reimburse
Moore  for any otherwise unreimbursed health or medical insurance
premiums  and/or  uncovered medical expenses up  to  $10,000  per
calendar   year  under  a  written  medical  reimbursement   plan
maintained for Moore and other key executive employees.  If  such
payments  are  taxable to Moore, the Company shall  pay  Moore  a
gross-up  equal to the estimated income, FICA and Medicare  taxes
due  with  respect to such reimbursement, with federal and  state
income taxes being estimated at the highest marginal rates.

               C.   Moore shall be eligible to participate in any
profit  sharing  plan,  employee stock ownership  plan  or  other
qualified  retirement plan adopted by Company to the same  extent
as  other  executive employees of Company.  Moore shall  also  be
eligible  to  participate in any stock option, restricted  stock,
stock appreciation rights or stock purchase plans or programs  or
nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements of Company, which
participation shall be at levels as may be determined appropriate
by the Compensation Committee.

               D.   The Company agrees to reimburse Moore for the
cost  of  investment  and  tax planning  services  up  to  $5,000
incurred during each calendar year.  If such payments are taxable
to  Moore,  the Company shall pay Moore a gross-up equal  to  the
estimated  income, FICA and Medicare taxes due  with  respect  to
such  reimbursement, with federal and state  income  taxes  being
estimated at the highest marginal rates.

          7.    Reimbursement of Expenses. The Company agrees  to
promptly   reimburse  Moore,  within  fifteen  (15)  days   after
presentation of receipts and other appropriate documentation, for
all  reasonable,  ordinary and necessary travel costs  and  other
necessary  expenses  incurred by Moore in performing  his  duties
pursuant to this Agreement.

          8.   Stock Options

                A.   Mandatory Stock Options.  Company agrees  to
continue   in  force  a  stock  option  plan  or  one  which   is
substantially similar to the existing plan ("Stock Option Plan"),
which has been approved by the shareholders of the Company,  and,
on  the  first business day in each October commencing in October
2002  and  (subject  to  the provisions of Paragraph  10.E.(iii))
continuing so long as Moore is employed by the Company  to  grant
Moore  options under the Stock Option Plan to purchase  not  less
than  100,000 shares of the common stock of ACAH (such number  to
be  adjusted  to  reflect any stock splits or  other  adjustments
after  the Effective Date) at the price per share at the  closing
of  the  trading market on the last business date prior  to  such
grant.   The Company also agrees to approve the issuance of  such
additional  shares as are necessary to enable Moore  to  exercise
such options.  The Company will not be required to reserve shares
from  existing  plans  to  cover future  obligations  under  this
Paragraph,  but will use reasonable efforts to obtain shareholder
approval  as  necessary from time to time to  make  a  sufficient
number of additional shares available on a timely basis, and will
provide  Moore  with  equivalent alternative compensation  should
approval not be obtained.  The terms of the grant of such options
shall  be consistent with the terms of the Stock Option Agreement
being utilized at the time of the grant for stock options granted
to  other  senior executive officers at or below Moore's position
with   the  Company.  The  Compensation  Committee  retains  full
discretion of whether to grant any additional stock options other
than those required as provided above, and to change the terms of
the Stock Option Agreement for any such additional stock options.

                B.    Acceleration of Stock Options upon a Change
in  Control.  If the Company experiences a Corporate Change,  the
exercisability and vesting of all Stock Options held by Moore  as
of  the  date of the Corporate Change shall accelerate as of  the
date of such Corporate Change.  The Compensation Committee of the
Company's  Board of Directors shall provide that if  a  Corporate
Change  occurs,  then  effective as of a  date  selected  by  the
Compensation  Committee, the Compensation  Committee  (which  for
purposes of the Corporate Changes described in clauses (iii)  and
(v)  of  the  definition of Corporate Change below shall  be  the
Compensation Committee as constituted prior to the occurrence  of
such Corporate Change) acting in its sole discretion without  the
consent  or  approval of Moore, will effect one or  more  of  the
following  alternatives  or  combination  of  alternatives   with
respect to all outstanding Stock Options (which alternatives  may
be  conditional on the occurrence of such of the Corporate Change
specified  in  clause  (i)  through  (v)  of  the  definition  of
Corporate Change below which gives rise to the Corporate Change):
(1)  in the case of a Corporate Change specified in clauses  (i),
(ii)  or (iv) of the definition thereof, provide that exercisable
options (including any options exercisable pursuant to the  first
sentence  of  this  Paragraph  8.B.)  then  outstanding  may   be
exercised  in full for a limited period of time on  or  before  a
specified date (which will permit Moore to participate  with  the
Common  Stock received upon exercise of such option in the  event
of  a Corporate Change specified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iv)  of
the  definition of Corporate Change below, as the  case  may  be)
fixed  by the Compensation Committee, after which specified  date
all  unexercised options and all rights of Moore thereunder shall
terminate,  (2)  provide that exercisable options (including  any
options  exercisable  pursuant to  the  first  sentence  of  this
Paragraph  8.B.) then outstanding may be exercised so  that  such
options  may be exercised in full for their then remaining  term,
or  (3)  require  the  mandatory  surrender  to  the  Company  of
outstanding   options  held  by  Moore  (including  any   options
exercisable  pursuant  to the first sentence  of  this  Paragraph
8.B.)  as  of a date, before or not later than sixty  days  after
such  Corporate Change, specified by the Compensation  Committee,
and  in  such  event the Compensation Committee  shall  thereupon
cancel  such options and the Company shall pay to Moore an amount
of  cash  equal  to the excess of the fair market  value  of  the
aggregate shares subject to such option over the aggregate option
price   of  such  shares;  provided,  however,  the  Compensation
Committee shall not select an alternative (unless consented to by
Moore)  that, if Moore exercised his accelerated options pursuant
to  alternative  1  or  2  and participated  in  the  transaction
specified  in  clause  (i), (ii) or (iv)  of  the  definition  of
Corporate   Change   below   or   received   cash   pursuant   to
alternative 3, would result in Moore's owing any money by  virtue
of  operation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.  If all  such
alternatives have such a result, the Compensation Committee shall
take such action, which is hereby authorized, to put Moore in  as
close  to  the  same position as Moore would  have  been  in  had
alternative 1, 2 or 3 been selected but without resulting in  any
payment  by Moore pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange  Act.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, with the consent  of  Moore,  the
Compensation  Committee may in lieu of the  foregoing  make  such
provision  with  respect  of any Corporate  Change  as  it  deems
appropriate.

               C.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement:

                     (i)  "Stock Options" shall mean any grant to
Moore  by  the Company, pursuant to a Stock Option Plan,  of  the
right  and option to purchase from the Company a specified number
of  shares of Atlantic Coast Airlines Holdings, Inc. common stock
under certain terms and conditions.

                     (ii)  "Change  in  Control"  and  "Corporate
Change" shall each mean (i) any merger or consolidation in  which
the  Company shall not be the surviving entity (or survives  only
as  a  subsidiary  of another entity, unless the stockholders  of
Company  immediately  before such merger  or  consolidation  own,
directly  or  indirectly  immediately following  such  merger  or
consolidation, substantially all of the combined voting power  of
the  surviving  entity in substantially the  same  proportion  as
their  ownership immediately before such merger or consolidation,
(ii) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets
to  any  other  person  or  entity  (other  than  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary),  (iii)  the acquisition of beneficial  ownership  or
control  of  (including, without limitation, power to vote)  more
than  50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock by any person
or  entity  (including a "group" as defined by or  under  Section
13(d)(3)   of   the  Exchange  Act),  (iv)  the  dissolution   or
liquidation   of  the  Company,  (v)  a  contested  election   of
directors, as a result of which or in connection with  which  the
persons who were directors of the Company before such election or
their  nominees cease to constitute a majority of the  Board,  or
(vi) any other event specified by the Compensation Committee.

               D.   Amendment to Existing Option Agreements.  The
provisions  of Paragraph 8.B. and 8.C herein shall apply  to  all
Stock  Options or restricted stock previously granted  to  Moore,
and  this  Agreement shall be deemed to be a restatement  of  the
previous  amendment  to  all  Stock Option  or  Restricted  Stock
Agreements presently in existence between the Company and  Moore,
and will supersede any language to the contrary contained in said
agreements.   These  terms  will also apply  to  mandatory  Stock
Options  granted  as  provided  in  subparagraph  A  above.   The
Compensation  Committee  retains full discretion  of  whether  to
grant  any  additional Stock Options in the  future,  and  if  so
whether  the  terms  provided herein will  apply  to  said  Stock
Options.

                E.    The  Company has granted to Moore  options,
under  the  Stock  Option Plan and pursuant to  a  Company  Stock
Option Agreement, to purchase 100,000 shares (prior to adjustment
for  subsequent  stock  splits)  of  the  common  stock  of  ACAH
effective  as  of  July 21, 1999 at the price per  share  at  the
closing   of  the  trading  market  on  July  20,  1999.    Moore
acknowledges that said grant is in lieu of grants that  that  may
otherwise have been due to him prior to October 1, 2000.

          9.    Deductions.  Deductions shall be  made  from  any
component  of  Moore's  compensation provided  pursuant  to  this
Agreement  or  otherwise for social security, Medicare,  federal,
state  and local withholding taxes, and any other such  taxes  as
may from time to time be required by any governmental authority.

          10.   Termination. Moore's employment with the  Company
shall  be  terminated  only  in  accordance  with  the  following
provisions:

               A.   Disability.

                    (i)  In the event Moore shall become mentally
or  physically disabled so as to have been unable to perform  his
duties  hereunder  for  six (6) consecutive  months,  subject  to
Moore's right to return to work as provided below, Company  shall
have  the right to terminate Moore's employment with Company upon
the  expiration of such six month period; provided, however, that
upon  any such termination Company shall be obligated to  provide
Moore  with Severance Compensation as provided in Paragraph 10.E.
herein.   Such six-month period shall be deemed to have commenced
on the date when Moore is first unable to perform his duties on a
substantially  full-time  basis because  of  mental  or  physical
disability and shall end on the date on which Moore shall  return
to  the substantial full-time performance of his duties.   If  at
the expiration of such six month period, the Company shall desire
to  terminate  Moore on the basis of disability,  it  shall  give
written  notice to him.  Moore's employment shall  thereafter  be
terminated  if  he  does  not  return  to  substantial  full-time
performance  of  his duties within ten (10) calendar  days  after
such notice is given.

                      (ii)  Nothing  contained  herein  shall  be
construed to affect Moore's rights under any disability insurance
or  similar policy, whether maintained by the Company,  Moore  or
another  party.  The Company may utilize a disability  policy  to
fund, in whole or in part, the compensation that would be due  to
Moore  during  the  term of or in the event of a  disability,  in
which case the proceeds of the policy would not be in addition to
any compensation otherwise payable to Moore.

                     (iii)      For  purposes of this  Agreement,
Moore  shall  be  deemed to be disabled when he shall  have  been
absent  from his duties because of sickness, illness,  injury  or
other  physical or mental infirmity on a substantially  full-time
basis.   In  the  event  of  a dispute as  to  whether  Moore  is
disabled, the issue of the determination of disability  shall  be
submitted to a Board of Arbiters for a binding decision under the
procedures set forth in Paragraph 10.A.(v) below.

                     (iv)     At the end of any disability (other
than  a  disability  that results in the termination  of  Moore's
employment with the Company), Moore shall return to work and this
Agreement  shall  continue  as though  such  disability  had  not
occurred.

                     (v)   If  there is a dispute as  to  whether
Moore  is subject to any disability, the issue shall be submitted
to  a  Board of Arbiters (whose decision shall be binding on  the
Company and Moore) consisting of three persons: one physician who
specializes  in  the  physical or mental  disability  in  dispute
(hereinafter referred to as a "Specialist") shall be appointed on
behalf  of  Company  by  the Chairman of the  Board,  or  by  the
Compensation Committee; a second Specialist shall be appointed by
Moore  and  a  third  Specialist shall be appointed  by  the  two
Specialists  so  appointed.  The decision of a majority  of  such
Specialists  shall  be  binding upon the parties  hereto.   If  a
majority of the Specialists determines that Moore is not  subject
to  any  disability for purposes of this Agreement,  Moore  shall
return to work under the provisions hereof.  Such Specialists may
physically examine Moore, who hereby consents to such examination
and to make available any pertinent medical records.  The cost of
such Specialists shall be paid by Company.

                     (vi)  If  it  is determined that  Moore  can
return to work hereunder on a part-time basis, the parties  agree
to  use  good  faith efforts to negotiate the  terms  of  Moore's
return to work.

                    (vii)     During any period in which Moore is
disabled but his employment shall not have been terminated, Moore
shall  continue  to  receive his base salary and  any  applicable
bonus,  and shall continue to receive all benefits as an employee
and  as provided herein generally. Any options previously granted
shall  continue to vest, but no new options shall  be  issued  to
Moore.   Any mandatory option grants as provided herein shall  be
deferred until such time as the disability period ends.

                    (viii)    During any period in which Moore is
disabled but his employment shall not have been terminated, Moore
shall  continue to be credited with Years of Service for purposes
of  vesting  of Deferred Compensation as set forth  in  Paragraph
5.D.

               B.   Death.

                     (i)   Moore's employment with Company  shall
terminate immediately upon Moore's death; provided, however, that
Company  shall be obligated to provide the Severance Compensation
as  specified in Paragraph 10.E. herein to Moore's estate,  heirs
or beneficiaries.

                      (ii)  Nothing  contained  herein  shall  be
construed  to  affect Moore's rights under any life insurance  or
similar  policy, whether maintained by Company, Moore or  another
party.  The Company may utilize a life insurance policy to  fund,
in  whole  or in part, the Severance Compensation that  would  be
payable in the event of Moore's death, in which case the proceeds
of  any  such policy other than the Split Dollar Agreement  would
not  be  in  addition  to  any Severance  Compensation  otherwise
payable under this Paragraph 10.B.

               C.   Termination by Moore.

                      (i)   Other  than  Following  a  Change  in
Control.   Moore may  terminate his employment by  delivering  to
Company  sixty  (60) days' written notice, and  such  termination
shall be effective on the sixtieth (60th) day following the  date
of  receipt  of  such notice (the "Termination Date").   In  such
event, Moore (i) shall continue to render his services up to  the
Termination  Date if so requested by Company and  (ii)  shall  be
paid his regular base salary and shall receive all benefits up to
the  Termination Date.  Moore will be entitled to payment of  any
bonus  due but not yet paid for prior bonus periods (paid at  the
same time it would have been paid had Moore's employment not been
terminated),  but will not be entitled to Severance Compensation,
to  any  bonus  for the current bonus period,  or  to  any  other
compensation,  bonus  or  fringe  benefits  accrued   after   the
Termination Date.

                      (ii)   Following  a  Change   in   Control.
Notwithstanding  the above, in the event of  any  termination  by
Moore of his employment with the Company which is effected within
twelve  (12) months following a Change in Control as defined  and
determined under Paragraph 8.C. of this Agreement, Company  shall
be  obligated  to  provide Moore with Severance  Compensation  as
provided  in Paragraph 10.E. herein; provided that payments  made
as  separately provided in Paragraph 5.H. of this Agreement shall
be  deducted from Severance Compensation due in this event.   The
twelve  month  period  will be deemed to mean  any  notice  given
within  twelve  months following a Change  in  Control  where  an
actual  termination  occurs  within  sixty  days  following  said
notice.

               D.   Termination by Company.

                     (i)   Without  Cause.  Company may,  without
cause,  terminate Moore's employment under this Agreement at  any
time  by  giving Moore fifteen (15) days' written notice thereof,
and  such  termination shall be effective on  the  fifteenth  day
following  the  date  such notice is given (said  15th  day,  the
"Termination  Date").   In  the  event  Moore's  employment  with
Company  is terminated without cause, Company shall be  obligated
to  provide  Moore  with Severance Compensation  as  provided  in
Paragraph  10.E.  herein.   At  the option  of  Company,  Moore's
employment  shall  be  immediately terminated  upon  the  Company
giving such notice, in which case Moore shall continue to receive
his  full  base  salary and related fringe benefits  through  the
Termination   Date.   Notwithstanding  any  provision   of   this
Agreement  to the contrary, any termination of Moore's employment
by the Company, for any reason or no reason, effected as a result
of,  in connection with or within twelve (12) months following  a
Change in Control, as defined and determined under Paragraph 8.C.
of  this  Agreement,  shall  automatically  be  deemed  to  be  a
termination  without  cause provided  that  any  amounts  due  as
Severance  Compensation shall be reduced as provided in Paragraph
5.H.   The twelve month period will be deemed to mean any  notice
given   within  twelve  months  following  a  Change  in  Control
regardless  of  when  actual termination  occurs  following  said
notice.

                    (ii) For Cause. Company may terminate Moore's
employment under this Agreement immediately for "cause".  In such
event,  the  Company  shall  not  be  liable  to  Moore  for  any
compensation, bonus or benefits after the date of termination  of
employment.  Cause shall be defined as any of the following:  (i)
willful  unauthorized misconduct in the material  performance  of
Moore's  duties hereunder, (ii) commission of an  act  of  theft,
fraud,  dishonesty or personal misconduct by Moore, which act  is
harmful  to  Company,  (iii) breach  of  any  provision  of  this
Agreement if such breach has not been cured by Moore (or if Moore
has not compensated the Company for such breach by payment of  an
amount  deemed reasonable by the Company if the breach cannot  be
cured)  within  fifteen (15) days after the Company  gives  Moore
written  notice  of  such  breach.  Any  termination  under  this
Paragraph  10.D.(ii)  shall  take  effect  immediately  upon  the
Company giving Moore written notice thereof.

                  E.      Severance   Compensation.    "Severance
Compensation" is defined as all of the compensation and  benefits
described in this Paragraph 10.E.  It will be provided  to  Moore
upon  the occurrence of any of the events described elsewhere  in
this  Agreement  as  providing for Moore's receipt  of  Severance
Compensation,  but not in any other circumstances except  to  the
extent  that individual components of Severance Compensation  may
be  separately provided pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement.
"Termination  Date"  is  defined  as  the  last  day  of  Moore's
employment  with the Company.  "Severance Period" is  defined  as
the  period  beginning on the day following the Termination  Date
and   ending  on  the  day  which  is  two  years  following  the
Termination  Date.  Benefits extending to  Moore's  spouse  shall
refer to Moore's spouse as of the date such benefits are extended
or,  after Moore's death, to Moore's spouse as of the date of his
death.  The compensation and benefits to be provided as Severance
Compensation are as follows:

                    (i)  Severance Pay.  Throughout the Severance
Period,  Moore will receive severance pay at the rate of 100%  of
his  annual base salary in effect at the time of his termination,
to  be paid on the Company's regular payroll payment dates at the
same  time  and  in  the  same fashion as the  Company's  regular
payroll payments.  In the event that a Termination Date occurs on
or  before  December  31, 1999 such that  Moore  is  entitled  to
Severance Compensation as provided herein, severance pay will  be
at  the  rate of 100% of his annual base salary that  would  have
been in effect beginning January 1, 2000 as provided herein.

                     (ii)  Bonus.  For all bonus plans  in  which
Moore  is  participating as of the Termination Date, the  Company
shall  pay  to Moore a lump sum bonus payout.  This payout  shall
consist of a payment in the amount calculated by the formula  [(x
+ y) * z] where (x) is Moore's base salary earned in the year from
January  1  to the Termination Date, (y) is the amount  which  is
three  times Moore's annual base salary in effect at the time  of
Termination, and (z) is the percentage which under each  plan  is
the  maximum percentage of base salary that Moore was eligible to
earn  during  the  year  in which the Termination  Date  occurred
assuming  all  targets  were met in full,  whether  or  not  said
targets actually were met.  The payments provided for under  this
Paragraph 10.E.(ii) will be paid in cash or in such other form as
bonus amounts generally are paid to eligible employees, or  in  a
combination thereof, as determined by the Compensation Committee,
within  thirty days following the Termination Date and  shall  be
considered to be full compensation for all amounts due  to  Moore
for  bonus  plans  in  which  he  was  participating  as  of  the
Termination  Date, and he shall not be entitled  to  any  further
payments  under any of said plans during the Severance Period  or
thereafter.   Notwithstanding the above, any bonus due  to  Moore
for  years (or any other applicable bonus period) completed prior
to  the  Termination  Date but not yet  paid  shall  be  paid  in
addition  to the bonus described herein. If such bonus for  prior
years  is  in  the form of restricted stock, such bonus  will  be
considered  earned to the extent that applicable vesting  targets
have   been   met  as  of  the  Termination  Date,  whether   the
confirmation  that  the targets have been met  occurs  before  or
after  the Termination Date.  If such targets have been  met  but
the stock has not yet been distributed, Moore will be entitled to
receive  the  stock, or, at the option of the Company,  the  cash
equivalent thereof, no later than the date the stock was  due  to
be  distributed had the termination not occurred.  Any such stock
for which targets have not been met will be forfeited.

                     (iii)      Stock  Options.  All  options  to
purchase shares of ACAH stock that have been granted to Moore and
that  are  not  exercisable  as of  the  Termination  Date  shall
terminate  as of said date.  For all options that are exercisable
as of said date (including options that are accelerated following
a  Change in Control pursuant to Paragraph 8 above), the terms of
exercise, payment, and expiration, shall be as provided  in  each
option  agreement.  All options that would have been  granted  to
Moore  in the future pursuant to Paragraph 8.A. hereof shall  not
be  granted  if  the date on which they would have  been  granted
occurs  after  the Termination Date, even though  said  date  may
occur during the Severance Period.

                     (iv)  Deferred Compensation.   The  Deferred
Compensation  program  will  continue  throughout  the  Severance
Period,  including Moore's accumulation of Years of  Service  for
vesting  purposes,  and including the Company's  continuation  of
contributions.  At the end of the Severance Period,  the  Company
shall pay Moore an amount equal to his vested interest under  the
Deferred   Compensation  as  provided  in  Paragraph   5.D.(iii).
Alternatively, the Company may elect to pay such amounts to Moore
as  would  be payable during the Severance Period by the  Company
under  the  Deferred Compensation program in a  single  lump  sum
payment  within  fifteen (15) days after  the  Termination  Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have a right  of
set-off  against, and may reduce the amount payable  as  Deferred
Compensation  by,  any amount owed or payable  by  Moore  to  the
Company.

                     (v)   Insurance Programs.  The Split  Dollar
Agreement  shall  continue in full force and effect  through  the
Severance  Period and shall survive separate and apart from  this
Agreement,  and  the  Company's obligation to  pay  all  premiums
pursuant to this Agreement shall continue in accordance with  the
terms of this Agreement for the Severance Period.  At the end  of
the  Severance Period, Moore shall pay to the Company  an  amount
equal  to  the total of all premiums paid by the Company  on  the
split  dollar  policy(ies) acquired pursuant to  Paragraph  5.E.,
without  interest thereon, and upon receipt of such  payment  the
Company  shall release its interest in the policy, or  a  portion
thereof,  on Moore's life acquired pursuant to the terms  of  the
Split  Dollar  Agreement, or any or all of the paid up  additions
standing  to  the credit of such policy, if any, such  that  such
released  interest equals the total of all premiums paid  by  the
Company  on  the  split dollar policy(ies) acquired  pursuant  to
Paragraph 5.E.  Alternatively, if the Company elects to  pay  the
Deferred Compensation to Moore within fifteen (15) days after the
Termination  Date  pursuant  to Paragraph  10.E.(iv)  above,  the
Company at the time of such payment may demand payment from Moore
of  an  amount  equal to the total of all premiums  paid  by  the
Company  on  the  split dollar policy(ies) acquired  pursuant  to
Paragraph  5.E.,  without interest thereon, and upon  receipt  of
such  payment  release  its interest in the  policy,  or  portion
thereof,  acquired  pursuant to the terms  of  the  Split  Dollar
Agreement,  and any or all of the paid up additions  standing  to
the  credit  of such policy, if any, and thereafter  the  Company
shall  be  under no obligation to pay any further premiums  under
the  Split Dollar Agreement.  Coverage under the Company's  major
medical,  accident, health, dental, disability and life insurance
plans  as from time to time provided to other executive employees
of  the Company (and, to the extent provided by such policies, to
Moore's  dependents) shall continue to be paid for by the Company
during   the  Severance  Period  or,  in  the  event  of  Moore's
termination upon or following a Change of Control of the  Company
as  defined  in  Paragraph 8.C., for the longer of the  Severance
Period  or  the remainder of Moore's and his spouse's  life,  and
including  children to age 21 as per coverage provided  prior  to
the  Change  in  Control.  Provided, however,  if  such  coverage
cannot  be continued during the Severance Period or until Moore's
and  his  spouse's death, as the case may be, under the terms  of
such policies or plans, the Company shall reimburse Moore for the
cost  of comparable coverage under individually obtained policies
or for COBRA coverage, or shall make other arrangements to assure
that Moore has comparable coverage.

                     (vi)  Vacation.  Vacation shall not continue
to accrue after the Termination Date under any circumstances.

                     (vii)      Executive  Medical  Reimbursement
Plan  and  Investment and Tax Planning.  Throughout the Severance
Period, the Company will continue to promptly reimburse Moore for
any  otherwise unreimbursed health and medical insurance premiums
and/or uncovered medical expenses up to $10,000 per calendar year
under  a  written medical reimbursement plan maintained  for  the
Company's  key executive employees, and for the $5,000  per  year
investment  and  tax planning service expenses,  incurred  during
each calendar year, including the tax gross-up, if applicable.

                    (viii)    Travel Benefits. The Atlantic Coast
Airlines   Holdings,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  flight   pass
privileges  currently  granted to Moore  will  continue  for  the
Severance Period.  Moore and his wife shall be provided with free
travel  on the Company's planes or on the planes of any successor
in  interest  to the Company on a positive space basis,  and  his
children  shall  be  provided free travel on  a  space  available
basis.   Moore  shall not be entitled to travel benefits  on  any
other airline.

                      (ix)  Deductions  for  Taxes.  Subject   to
Paragraph  5.G.(v), any compensation due to Moore hereunder  will
be  subject to deductions for social security, federal and  state
withholding taxes, and any other such taxes as may from  time  to
time be required by governmental authority.

     11.  Nonsolicitation, Non-Competition, and Confidentiality

                A.   Nonsolicitation and Non-Competition.  For so
long  as  Moore  is  an employee of the Company,  and  continuing
thereafter for twelve months following any termination of Moore's
employment, or with respect to the provisions of (i), below,  for
the  longer  of  such twelve month period or for such  period  as
Moore  is  receiving  Severance Compensation,  Moore  shall  not,
without  the  prior written consent of the Company,  directly  or
indirectly,  as  a  sole  proprietor, member  of  a  partnership,
stockholder or investor, officer or director of a corporation, or
as  an  employee, associate, consultant or agent of  any  person,
partnership, corporation or other business organization or entity
other  than the Company:  (i) solicit or endeavor to entice  away
from  the Company or any of its subsidiaries any person or entity
who  is,  or,  during the then most recent 12 month  period,  was
employed by, or had served as an agent of, the Company or any  of
its  subsidiaries; or (ii) engage in or contract with  others  to
engage  in  any  business  enterprise, line  of  work  consulting
contract,  joint  venture or other arrangement which  conducts  a
business  or  businesses substantially similar  to  the  business
conducted by Company in any area in which Company or any  of  its
affiliates  or  subsidiaries provides or  plans  to  provide  air
transportation  to  the  public.   Moore  acknowledges  that  the
geographic area covered hereby, and the period and nature of  the
agreed   restrictions  are  reasonable  and  necessary  for   the
protection  of  the business of the Company.  All  provisions  of
this  Paragraph  concerning non-competition  are  severable;  and
while  it  is  the  intention of the parties  that  all  of  said
provisions shall be enforceable, if any one of the same shall  be
held to be unenforceable in whole or in part, the remainder shall
continue  to  be  in full force and effect.  The  terms  of  this
Paragraph  11.A  will  not  apply following  any  termination  of
Moore's  employment  that  was  effected  as  a  result  of,   in
connection with or within twelve (12) months following  a  Change
in  Control.   The  provisions  of  clause  (ii)  above  of  this
Paragraph  11.A  will  not  apply following  any  termination  of
Moore's  employment  by the Company other than  for  cause.   The
twelve  month  period  will be deemed to mean  any  notice  given
within twelve months following a Change in Control regardless  of
when actual termination occurs following said notice.

                B.   Confidentiality.  Moore covenants and agrees
with  the  Company  that  he will not  at  any  time,  except  in
performance of his obligations to the Company hereunder  or  with
the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly,
disclose any secret or confidential information that he may learn
or  has learned by reason of his association with the Company  or
any  of  its subsidiaries and affiliates.  The term "confidential
information" includes information not previously disclosed to the
public  or to the trade by the Company's management, or otherwise
in the public domain, with respect to the Company's or any of its
affiliates'  or subsidiaries', products, facilities, applications
and  methods,  trade  secrets  and other  intellectual  property,
systems, procedures, manuals, confidential reports, price  lists,
customer  lists,  technical  information,  financial  information
(including  the  revenues, costs or profits associated  with  the
Company),  business plans, prospects or opportunities, but  shall
exclude any information which (i) is or becomes available to  the
public  or  is  generally known in the industry or industries  in
which  the  Company operates other than as a result of disclosure
by Moore in violation of his agreements under this Paragraph 11.B
or  (ii) Moore is required to disclose under any applicable laws,
regulations  or directives of any government agency, tribunal  or
authority having jurisdiction in the matter or under subpoena  or
other process of law.

                C.   Exclusive Property.  Moore confirms that all
confidential  information  is  and  shall  remain  the  exclusive
property  of  the  Company.   All business  records,  papers  and
documents kept or made by Moore relating to the business  of  the
Company  shall be and remain the property of the Company,  except
for  such papers customarily deemed to be the personal copies  of
Moore.

                D.    Injunctive  Relief.  Without  intending  to
limit  the  remedies available to the Company, Moore acknowledges
that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Paragraph
11  may  result in material and irreparable injury to the Company
or  its affiliates or subsidiaries for which there is no adequate
remedy  at  law, that it will not be possible to measure  damages
for  such  injuries precisely and that, in the event  of  such  a
breach or threat thereof, the Company shall be entitled to seek a
temporary  restraining  order and/or a preliminary  or  permanent
injunction   restraining  Moore  from  engaging   in   activities
prohibited by this Paragraph 11 or such other relief  as  may  be
required  specifically to enforce any of the  covenants  in  this
Paragraph  11.   If  for  any  reason,  it  is  held   that   the
restrictions under this Paragraph 11 are not reasonable  or  that
consideration therefor is inadequate, such restrictions shall  be
interpreted  or modified to include as much of the  duration  and
scope  identified  in  this Paragraph  11  as  will  render  such
restrictions valid and enforceable.

          12.   Assignment  This Agreement, as it relates to  the
employment  of Moore, is a personal contract and the  rights  and
interests  of  Moore  hereunder may  not  be  sold,  transferred,
assigned, pledged or hypothecated.  However, this Agreement shall
inure  to  the  benefit of and be binding upon  Company  and  its
successors   and  assigns  including,  without  limitation,   any
corporation or other entity into which Company is merged or which
acquires all or substantially all of the outstanding common stock
or  assets of Company.  At any time prior to a Change in Control,
Company may provide, without the prior written consent of  Moore,
that Moore shall be employed pursuant to this Agreement by any of
its  affiliates instead of or in addition to Company, and in such
case  all  references herein to the "Company" shall be deemed  to
include  any  such  entity, provided that such action  shall  not
relieve  Company of its obligation to make or cause an  affiliate
to  make  or  provide for any payment to or on  behalf  of  Moore
pursuant to this Agreement.

          13.   Invalid Provisions. The invalidity of any one  or
more of the paragraphs or provisions of this Agreement shall  not
affect  the reasonable enforceability of the remaining paragraphs
or provisions of this Agreement, all of which are inserted herein
conditionally upon being valid in law; and in the  event  one  or
more  of  the paragraphs or provisions contained herein shall  be
invalid,  this instrument shall be construed as if  such  invalid
paragraphs or provisions had not been inserted or, alternatively,
said paragraphs or provisions shall be reasonably limited to  the
extent  that the applicable court interpreting the provisions  of
this Agreement considers to be reasonable.

          14.   Specific  Performance. The parties  hereby  agree
that  any  violation  by  Moore of the covenants  and  agreements
contained  herein shall cause irreparable damage to the  Company,
and  the  Company may, as a matter of course, enjoin and restrain
said  violation  by Moore by process issued out  of  a  court  of
competent  jurisdiction, in addition to any other  remedies  that
said court may see fit to award.

          15.   Binding  Effect. All the terms of this  Agreement
shall  be  binding upon and inure to the benefit of  the  parties
hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and
assigns.

          16.    Waiver   of  Breach  or  Violation  Not   Deemed
Continuin.   The waiver by the Company of any provision  of  this
Agreement may be effected only by a written waiver duly  executed
on  behalf  of  the Company and except to the extent specifically
provided in such waiver shall not operate as, or be construed  to
be, a waiver of any subsequent breach hereof.

          17.   Entire  Agreement; Law Governing  This  Agreement
supersedes  in its entirety the terms of the Severance  Agreement
between the parties dated as of December 28, 1999 and any and all
other  agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties
hereto  with respect to the subject matter hereof, by and between
the  Company  and  Moore,  and contains  all  the  covenants  and
agreements among the parties with respect to such subject matter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that  the  Company's
Deferred Compensation contributions or any other compensation  or
benefit  provided  for hereunder was paid, granted,  credited  or
funded under and pursuant to an earlier version of this Agreement
with  respect to service prior to the Effective Date and at rates
provided  for  under such earlier version, then such compensation
or   benefit   need  not  be  again  paid,  granted  or   funded,
respectively,  pursuant to this Agreement.  This Agreement  shall
be  construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth  of
Virginia,  without  regard to principles  of  conflicts  of  law.
Moore hereby acknowledges that he was given the opportunity to be
represented  by  counsel  of his choosing  in  the  drafting  and
negotiation   of  this  Agreement  and  that  he  reviewed   this
Agreement.  In  interpreting this Agreement, a  court  shall  not
treat either party as the draftsman of the Agreement.

          18.    Paragraph   Headings.  The  Paragraph   headings
contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall in
no manner be construed as a part of this Agreement.

          19.  Release by Moore. In the event of a termination of
employment  by  Moore  that results in the payment  of  Severance
Compensation  to him pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,  in
consideration for such Severance Compensation and as a  condition
precedent to the payment thereof, Moore hereby agrees to  execute
a  full and complete release to the Company releasing any and all
claims  that he may have against the Company including any claims
relating to his termination of employment.

          20.   Notices. All notices permitted or required to  be
given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed  to  have been sufficiently given, subject to the  further
provisions of this Paragraph 20, for all purposes when  presented
personally  to  such party (which in the case of  notice  to  the
Company,  shall be presented to the person holding the office  or

entering into this Agreement with Employee;

Now,  Therefore,  the  parties, for and in consideration  of  the
mutual   and  reciprocal  covenants  and  agreements  hereinafter
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, do  contract
and agree as follows:

Committee").   Employee's base salary  for  each  year  shall  be
payable   to  him  in  accordance  with  the  reasonable  payroll
practices  of  the  Company as from time to time  in  effect  for
executive employees (but in no event less often than monthly).

B.   Management  Incentive Plan and Executive Bonuses.   Employee
shall  participate  in the Company's Senior Management  Incentive
Plan  and in its Management Incentive Plan, both for so  long  as
the  Board  of  Directors determines to maintain either  of  such
plans, or any successor bonus plan or program for key executives.

C.  Deferred Compensation.

(i)  Employee will be entitled to deferred compensation under  an
unfunded    and   non-tax   qualified   arrangement    ("Deferred
Compensation") as described in this Paragraph 5.C.,  which  shall
supercede  and  control  over  all  prior  deferred  compensation
arrangements.    The  amounts credited as  Deferred  Compensation
will  be  recorded as a bookkeeping entry representing a  general
unsecured obligation of the Company and Employee shall not have a
claim  to  any specific assets of the Company in satisfaction  of
the amounts, if any, payable as Deferred Compensation.  As of the
Effective Date, the balance in the Deferred Compensation  account
recorded for Employee shall equal $_________, which is the amount
of  the Company's Deferred Compensation "contributions" under the
Severance Agreement between the Company and Employee, as such was
amended from time to time, through the Effective Date.  After the
Effective Date, the Company will credit Deferred Compensation  at
the  rate  of _________ percent (___%) of Employee's annual  base
salary.  Deferred Compensation will be based on Employee's annual
base  salary  in effect on January 1 in each year,  and  will  be
credited  as of January 1 in each year.  The Company may  provide
the  Deferred Compensation through a benefit plan so long as  (1)
the  amount  credited by the Company on Employee's behalf  equals
the amount set forth herein, and (2) the vesting schedule, credit
for  Years of Service, and terms of distribution are all at least
as  favorable  to Employee as set forth herein.  No  interest  or
rate  of  return or other appreciation or depreciation  of  value
shall  accrue  or be payable on amounts credited to  Employee  as
Deferred Compensation pursuant to this Paragraph 5.C. unless  the
Company elects otherwise.

(ii)   Vesting of Deferred Compensation will be based upon "Years
of  Service,"  with  Employee to be credited  with  one  Year  of
Service  for  completion  of each twelve (12)  consecutive  month
period of employment with the Company beginning ____________  and
ending  on  the  Deferred Compensation Ending  Date  (as  defined
below).  Employee will become vested in the Deferred Compensation
based on the following schedule:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Years of Service                        Percentage Vested
<C>                                                  <C>
Less than 4                                           0%
At least 4 but less than 5                           25%
At least 5 but less than 6                           35%
At least 6 but less than 7                           50%
At least 7 but less than 8                           65%
At least 8 but less than 9                           80%
At least 9                                          100%
</TABLE>

In  the  event of a Change in Control (as defined and  determined
under Paragraph
12  of  this  Agreement)  of the Company, Employee  shall  become
immediately  100%  vested  in  his Deferred  Compensation  amount
notwithstanding the above vesting schedule.

(iii)   The  "Deferred Compensation Ending Date" shall  mean  the
Termination Date (as defined below).  If Employee's employment is
terminated  upon or within twelve months following  a  Change  in
Control,  the "Deferred Compensation Ending Date" shall mean  the
last  day  of the Severance Period (as defined in Paragraph  10).
Deferred Compensation shall not be due during a Severance  Period
unless  Employee's employment is terminated upon or within twelve
months following a Change in Control, in which case the terms  of
Paragraph   10.E.(iv)(b)   will   apply.    Upon   the   Deferred
Compensation  Ending  Date, the Company  shall  pay  to  Employee
whatever   "Deferred  Compensation"  amount  is  equal   to   the
applicable vested percentage of the total amount then credited to
his  account  pursuant to this Paragraph 5.C.  The Company  shall
make  this payment in cash within thirty (30) days following  the
Deferred  Compensation  Ending Date, provided  that  the  Company
shall  have a right of set-off against, and may reduce the amount
payable  as Deferred Compensation by, any amount owed or  payable
by Employee to the Company.

D.   Split  Dollar  Life  Insurance.  The Company  shall  advance
amounts to fund payment of the premiums under a split dollar life
insurance  arrangement  covering Employee  as  provided  in  this
Paragraph  5.D.   As  of the date hereof, the split  dollar  life
insurance arrangement is provided under a policy or policies with
Phoenix  Home Life Mutual - (such policies and agreements related
thereto,  the  "Split  Dollar  Agreement").   The  Company  shall
continue to abide by the terms of the Split Dollar Agreement with
Employee in force on the date of this Agreement, but, subject  to
the  foregoing,  the  Company may implement  a  substitute  Split
Dollar Agreement so long as the amount of premiums funded by  the
Company on Employee's behalf equals the amount set forth herein.

(i)   Employee shall be the owner of the policy under  the  Split
Dollar  Agreement  and  will  have the  right  to  designate  his
beneficiary  with respect to proceeds of the policy payable  upon
his death; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
the  Company shall have a collateral assignment of the policy  as
security  for  the repayment of the amounts paid by  the  Company
toward the premiums for the policy.

(ii)   The Company shall pay the annual premium due on the policy
in an amount specified in this Agreement, as amended from time to
time.   From  and  after the Effective Date, the  amount  of  the
annual  premium  the  Company pays shall equal  ________  percent
(___%) of Employee's annual base salary in effect on January 1 in
each  year  the  Company  is obligated to  fund  the  premium  as
described  herein.   Provided that Employee remains employed with
the Company as of January 1 in a year, the  Company shall, except
as  provided  in Paragraph 5.D.(iii) below, for such year pay, on
or before  the  due date(s) under the terms of the policy, the
entire amount of the annual premium due on  the  policy  acquired
pursuant to this Paragraph  5.D.  During  any  Severance  Period,
the  Company's obligation  to  pay the annual premium due on  the
split  dollar insurance  policy  shall  end  on  the  Termination
Date  unless Employee's employment is terminated upon or within
twelve  months following  a Change in Control, in which case said
payments  will continue through the Severance Period.

(iii)   The  "Split  Dollar  Release Date"  shall  mean  (a)  the
Termination  Date  (as  defined below)  except  where  Employee's
employment  with the Company is terminated upon or within  twelve
months following a Change in Control, or (b) the last day of  the
Severance  Period  (as defined in Paragraph  10),  if  Employee's
employment  with the Company is terminated upon or within  twelve
months  following  a Change in Control.  The Company  shall  fund
payment  of  the premiums as provided in this Paragraph  5.D.  in
each  year  until the Split Dollar Release Date.  Upon the  Split
Dollar Release Date, the following shall occur:

(a)   Employee  shall pay to the Company an amount equal  to  the
total  of  all  premiums paid by the Company on the split  dollar
policy(ies) acquired pursuant to his employment with the  Company
to  the  date  hereof or subsequently pursuant to this  Paragraph
5.D.,  without interest thereon.  The Company may, at its option,
collect  such amount from any amounts it or any of its affiliates
owes to Employee.  Upon receipt of such payment the Company shall
release  its  interest in the policy, or a  portion  thereof,  on
Employee's  life  acquired pursuant to the  terms  of  the  Split
Dollar Agreement, or any or all of the paid up additions standing
to  the  credit  of such policy, if any, such that  the  released
interest equals the total of all premiums paid by the Company  on
the  split dollar policy(ies) acquired pursuant to this Paragraph
5.D.   The Company agrees that the amount of any such release  of
interest  by the Company shall reduce the amount of "Liabilities"
(as  such term is defined in the Agreement of Assignment of  Life
Insurance  Death  Benefit  As  Collateral  entered  into  between
Employee  and  the  Company in connection with the  Split  Dollar
Agreement)  owed  to  the Company in connection  with  the  Split
Dollar  Agreement  and  related Collateral Assignment  Agreement.
Accordingly, the Company also agrees to reduce to such extent its
interest  as  acquired  by collateral assignment  of  the  policy
pursuant  to  the  Split Dollar Agreement and related  Collateral
Assignment Agreement.

(b)   The Split Dollar Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect  and  survive  separate and  apart  from  this  Agreement;
provided,  however,  that  the  Company  shall  have  no  further
obligation  to  pay  any premium on the policy  under  the  Split
Dollar  Agreement  which has a due date after  the  Split  Dollar
Release  Date  and  such  obligation  shall  be  transferred   to
Employee.

E.   Discretionary  Compensation.  The Company may  pay  Employee
discretionary compensation, bonuses and benefits in  addition  to
those  provided for herein in such amounts and at such  times  as
the Compensation Committee shall determine.

 6.  Benefits.

A.   The  Company shall pay for or provide Employee such vacation
time  and benefits, including but not limited to, coverage  under
Company's major medical, accident, health, dental, disability and
life insurance plans, as are made available to other employees of
Company  generally (and, to the extent provided by such policies,
to Employee's dependents).

B.   The  Company agrees to promptly reimburse Employee  for  any
otherwise  unreimbursed  health  or  medical  insurance  premiums
and/or uncovered medical expenses up to $10,000 per calendar year
under  a  written  medical  reimbursement  plan  maintained   for
Employee and other key executive employees.  If such payments are
taxable  to  Employee, the Company shall pay Employee a  gross-up
equal  to the estimated income, FICA and Medicare taxes due  with
respect  to  such  reimbursement, with federal and  state  income
taxes being estimated at the highest marginal rates.

C.   The  Company agrees to reimburse Employee for  the  cost  of
investment and tax planning services up to $5,000 incurred during
each  calendar year.  If such payments are taxable  to  Employee,
the  Company shall pay Employee a gross-up equal to the estimated
income,  FICA  and  Medicare  taxes  due  with  respect  to  such
reimbursement,  with  federal  and  state  income   taxes   being
estimated at the highest marginal rates.

7.   Reimbursement of Expenses.  The Company agrees  to  promptly
reimburse  Employee, within fifteen (15) days after  presentation
of   receipts  and  other  appropriate  documentation,  for   all
reasonable,  ordinary  and  necessary  travel  costs  and   other
necessary expenses incurred by Employee in performing his  duties
pursuant to this Agreement.

8.  Stock Options.

A.   Acceleration of Stock Options upon a Change in Control.   If
the  Company  experiences a Corporate Change, the  exercisability
and vesting of all Stock Options granted to Employee and held  by
Employee  as of the date of the Corporate Change shall accelerate
as  of  the  date  of  such Corporate Change.   The  Compensation
Committee  shall provide that if a Corporate Change occurs,  then
effective  as  of a date selected by the Compensation  Committee,
the  Compensation Committee (which for purposes of the  Corporate
Changes  described in clauses (iii) and (v) of the definition  of
Corporate  Change herein shall be the Compensation  Committee  as
constituted  prior  to the occurrence of such  Corporate  Change)
acting in its sole discretion without the consent or approval  of
Employee,  will effect one or more of the following  alternatives
or  combination  of alternatives with respect to all  outstanding
Stock  Options  (which  alternatives may be  conditional  on  the
occurrence  of such of the Corporate Change specified  in  clause
(i) through (v) of the definition of Corporate Change below which
gives  rise  to  the Corporate Change:  (1)  in  the  case  of  a
Corporate  Change specified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iv)  of  the
definition  thereof, provide that exercisable options  (including
any  options exercisable pursuant to the first sentence  of  this
Paragraph 18.A.) then outstanding may be exercised in full for  a
limited period of time on or before a specified date (which  will
permit  Employee  to participate with the Common  Stock  received
upon  exercise of such option in the event of a Corporate  Change
specified  in  clauses  (i), (ii) or (iv) of  the  definition  of
Corporate  Change  below,  as the  case  may  be)  fixed  by  the
Compensation   Committee,   after  which   specified   date   all
unexercised  options and all rights of Employee thereunder  shall
terminate,  (2)  provide that exercisable options (including  any
options  exercisable  pursuant to  the  first  sentence  of  this
Paragraph  18.A.) then outstanding may be exercised so that  such
options  may be exercised in full for their then remaining  term,
or  (3)  require  the  mandatory  surrender  to  the  Company  of
outstanding  options  held  by Employee  (including  any  options
exercisable  pursuant  to the first sentence  of  this  Paragraph
18.A.)  as  of a date, before or not later than sixty days  after
such  Corporate Change, specified by the Compensation  Committee,
and  in  such  event the Compensation Committee  shall  thereupon
cancel  such  options and the Company shall pay  to  Employee  an
amount  of cash equal to the excess of the fair market  value  of
the  aggregate  shares subject to such option over the  aggregate
option  price of such shares; provided, however, the Compensation
Committee shall not select an alternative (unless consented to by
Employee)  that,  if  Employee exercised his accelerated  options
pursuant  to  alternative  1  or  2  and  participated   in   the
transaction  specified  in  clause (i),  (ii)  or  (iv)   of  the
definition of Corporate Change below or received cash pursuant to
alternative  3,  would result in Employee's owing  any  money  by
virtue of operation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.  If all
such  alternatives have such a result, the Compensation Committee
shall  take  such  action,  which is hereby  authorized,  to  put
Employee in as close to the same position as Employee would  have
been  in  had  alternative 1, 2 or 3 been  selected  but  without
resulting in any payment by Employee pursuant to Section 16(b) of
the  Exchange  Act.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  with  the
consent  of Employee, the Compensation Committee may in  lieu  of
the  foregoing make such provision with respect of any  Corporate
Change as it deems appropriate.

B.  Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Stock Options"
shall mean any grant to Employee by the Company, pursuant to  any
of  the Company's Stock Option Plans, of the right and option  to
acquire from the Company a specified number of shares of Atlantic
Coast  Airlines Holdings, Inc. common stock under  certain  terms
and conditions.  "Change in Control" and "Corporate Change" shall
be as defined in Paragraph 12 herein.

C.   Amendment to Existing Option Agreements.  The provisions  of
this  Paragraph 8 shall apply to all Stock Options or  restricted
stock  previously granted to Employee, and this Amendment  Number
One shall be deemed to be a restatement of the previous amendment
to all Stock Option Agreements and the Restricted Stock Agreement
presently in existence between the Company and Employee, and will
supersede  any  language  to  the  contrary  contained  in   said
agreements.   The Compensation Committee retains full  discretion
of  whether  to  grant any Stock Options, and if so  whether  the
terms provided herein will apply to said Stock Options.

9.   Deductions.  Deductions shall be made from any component  of
Employee's  compensation provided pursuant to this  Agreement  or
otherwise for social security, Medicare, federal, state and local
withholding taxes, and any other such taxes as may from  time  to
time be required by any governmental authority.

10.   Termination.  Employee's employment with the Company  shall
be terminated only in accordance with the following provisions:

A.  Disability.

(i)   In  the  event Employee shall become mentally or physically
disabled  so  as  to  have  been unable  to  perform  his  duties
hereunder  (such determination to be made solely by the  Company)
for  six (6) consecutive months, Company shall have the right  to
terminate  Employee's employment with Company upon the expiration
of  such six month period; provided, however, that upon any  such
termination  Company shall be obligated to provide Employee  with
Severance  Compensation  as provided in Paragraph  10.E.  herein.
Such  six-month period shall be deemed to have commenced  on  the
date  when  Employee is first unable to perform his duties  on  a
substantially  full-time  basis because  of  mental  or  physical
disability  and  shall  end on the date on which  Employee  shall
return  to  the substantial full-time performance of his  duties.
If  at the expiration of such six month period, the Company shall
desire to terminate Employee on the basis of disability, it shall
give   written  notice  to  him.   Employee's  employment   shall
thereafter  be  terminated if he does not return  to  substantial
full-time performance of his duties within ten (10) calendar days
after such notice is given.

(ii)  For purposes of this Agreement, Employee shall be deemed to
be  disabled  when  he  shall have been absent  from  his  duties
because of sickness, illness, injury or other physical or  mental
infirmity on a substantially full-time basis.

(iii)  At the end of any disability (other than a disability that
results  in  the  termination of Employee's employment  with  the
Company), Employee shall return to work and this Agreement  shall
continue as though such disability had not occurred.

(iv)   The  Company  will  have sole  discretion  in  determining
whether Employee is subject to any disability.

(v)   During  any  period in which Employee is disabled  but  his
employment  shall  not  have  been  terminated,  Employee   shall
continue to receive his base salary and any applicable bonus, and
shall  continue  to receive all benefits as an  employee  and  as
provided  herein generally. Any options previously granted  shall
continue to vest, but no new options shall be issued to Employee.

(vi)   During  any period in which Employee is disabled  but  his
employment  shall  not  have  been  terminated,  Employee   shall
continue  to  be credited with Years of Service for  purposes  of
vesting of Deferred Compensation as set forth in Paragraph 5.C.

(vii)   The Company may utilize a disability policy to  fund,  in
whole  or in part, the compensation that would be due to Employee
during the term of or in the event of a disability, in which case
the  proceeds  of  the policy would not be  in  addition  to  any
compensation otherwise payable to Employee.  Any compensation due
to  Employee  from the Company during a period of  disability  or
during  a  Severance Period following a termination of employment
as a result of a disability, will be reduced by the amount of any
proceeds provided to Employee from any disability policy provided
by  and at the expense of the Company.  Except as provided in the
preceding  two  sentences,  nothing  contained  herein  shall  be
construed  to  affect  Employee's  rights  under  any  disability
insurance  or similar policy, whether maintained by the  Company,
Employee or another party.

B.  Death.

(i)    Employee's   employment  with  Company   shall   terminate
immediately  upon  Employee's  death;  provided,  however,   that
Company  shall be obligated to provide the Severance Compensation
as  specified  in  Paragraph 10.E. herein to  Employee's  estate,
heirs or beneficiaries.

(ii)   Nothing  contained  herein shall be  construed  to  affect
Employee's  rights  under any life insurance or  similar  policy,
whether  maintained by Company, Employee or another  party.   The
Company may utilize a life insurance policy to fund, in whole  or
in  part, the Severance Compensation that would be payable in the
event of Employee's death, in which case the proceeds of any such
policy  other  than the Split Dollar Agreement would  not  be  in
addition  to  any Severance Compensation otherwise payable  under
this Paragraph 10.B.

C.  Termination by Employee.

  (i)   Other  than Following a Change in Control.  Employee  may
terminate  his  employment by delivering to Company  thirty  (30)
days' written notice, and such termination shall be effective  on
the  thirtieth (30th) day following the date of receipt  of  such
notice  (the  "Termination Date").  In such event,  Employee  (i)
shall continue to render his services up to the Termination  Date
if  so  requested by Company and (ii) shall be paid  his  regular
base  salary and shall receive all benefits up to the Termination
Date.  Employee will be entitled to payment of any bonus due  but
not  yet  paid for prior bonus periods (paid at the same time  it
would   have  been  paid  had  Employee's  employment  not   been
terminated),  but will not be entitled to Severance Compensation,
to  any  bonus  for the current bonus period,  or  to  any  other
compensation,  bonus  or  fringe  benefits  accrued   after   the
Termination Date.

(ii)   Following a Change in Control.  Notwithstanding the above,
in  the  event  of any termination by Employee of his  employment
with  the  Company  which is effected within twelve  (12)  months
following  a  Change in Control as defined and  determined  under
Paragraph  12  of this Agreement, Company shall be  obligated  to
provide  Employee  with  Severance Compensation  as  provided  in
Paragraph 10.E. herein, excluding payments as separately provided
in  Paragraph  12.B of this Agreement.  The twelve  month  period
will  be  deemed  to mean any notice given within  twelve  months
following a Change in Control where an actual termination  occurs
within sixty days following said notice.

D.  Termination by Company.

(i)   Without  Cause.   Company  may,  without  cause,  terminate
Employee's employment under this Agreement at any time by  giving
Employee  fifteen  (15) days' written notice  thereof,  and  such
termination shall be effective on the fifteenth day following the
date  such  notice  is  given (said 15th  day,  the  "Termination
Date").   In  the  event Employee's employment  with  Company  is
terminated  without cause, Company shall be obligated to  provide
Employee  with  Severance Compensation as provided  in  Paragraph
10.E.  herein.   At the option of Company, Employee's  employment
shall  be  immediately terminated upon the  Company  giving  such
notice, in which case Employee shall continue to receive his full
base  salary  and related fringe benefits through the Termination
Date.   Notwithstanding any provision of this  Agreement  to  the
contrary,  any  termination  of  Employee's  employment  by   the
Company, for any reason or no reason, effected as a result of, in
connection with or within twelve (12) months following  a  Change
in  Control, as defined and determined under Paragraph 12 of this
Agreement,  shall  automatically be deemed to  be  a  termination
without   cause  provided  that  any  amounts  due  as  Severance
Compensation shall be reduced as provided in Paragraph 12.C.  The
twelve  month  period  will be deemed to mean  any  notice  given
within twelve months following a Change in Control regardless  of
when actual termination occurs following said notice.

(ii)   For  Cause.  Company may terminate  Employee's  employment
under this Agreement immediately for "cause".  In such event, the
Company  shall  not  be liable to Employee for any  compensation,
bonus  or  benefits after the date of termination of  employment.
Cause  shall  be  defined  as any of the following:  (i)  willful
unauthorized misconduct in the material performance of Employee's
duties  hereunder,  (ii) commission of an act  of  theft,  fraud,
dishonesty,  or  personal misconduct by Employee,  which  act  is
harmful  to  Company,  (iii) breach  of  any  provision  of  this
Agreement  if such breach has not been cured by Employee  (or  if
Employee  has  not  compensated the Company for  such  breach  by
payment  of  an  amount deemed reasonable by the Company  if  the
breach  cannot  be  cured) within fifteen  (15)  days  after  the
Company  gives  Employee  written notice  of  such  breach.   Any
termination  under  this Paragraph 10.D.(ii)  shall  take  effect
immediately  upon  the  Company giving  Employee  written  notice
thereof.

E.   Severance Compensation.  "Severance Compensation" is defined
as  all  of  the  compensation  and benefits  described  in  this
Paragraph  10.E.   It  will  be provided  to  Employee  upon  the
occurrence  of  any  of the events described  elsewhere  in  this
Agreement  as  providing  for  Employee's  receipt  of  Severance
Compensation,  but not in any other circumstances except  to  the
extent  that individual components of Severance Compensation  may
be  separately provided pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement.
"Termination  Date"  is  defined as the last  day  of  Employee's
employment  with the Company.  "Severance Period" is  defined  as
the  period  beginning on the day following the Termination  Date
and ending on the day which is one year following the Termination
Date.   Should  a termination occur upon or within twelve  months
following a Change in Control, the Severance Period will  end  on
the  day which is two years following the Termination Date.   The
compensation   and   benefits  to  be   provided   as   Severance
Compensation are as follows:

(i)   Severance  Pay.  Throughout the Severance Period,  Employee
will receive severance pay at the rate of 100% of his annual base
salary  in effect at the time of his termination, to be  paid  on
the  Company's regular payroll payment dates at the same time and
in the same fashion as the Company's regular payroll payments.

(ii)   Bonus.   The  Company shall pay  to  Employee  a  prorated
portion   of   any  annual  bonus  amount  accrued  through   the
Termination Date, provided, however, that such bonus amount  will
be  paid at the time that such bonus amounts are normally paid by
the  Company.  Proration shall be based on the percentage of  the
number of days from the beginning of the bonus period through the
Termination  Date,  to the total  number of  days  in  the  bonus
period,  times the total bonus that would have been paid for  the
entire  bonus  period  had the termination  not  occurred.   This
prorated   bonus  payment  shall  be  considered   to   be   full
compensation for all amounts due to Employee for bonus  plans  in
which  he  was participating as of the Termination Date,  and  he
shall  not be entitled to any further payments under any of  said
plans during the Severance Period or thereafter.  Notwithstanding
the  above,  any bonus due to Employee for years  (or  any  other
applicable bonus period) completed prior to the Termination  Date
but not yet paid shall be paid in addition to the bonus described
herein.   If  such  bonus  for prior years  is  in  the  form  of
restricted  stock, such bonus will be considered  earned  to  the
extent  that applicable vesting targets have been met as  of  the
Termination Date, whether the confirmation that the targets  have
been  met occurs before or after the Termination Date.   If  such
targets have been met but the stock has not yet been distributed,
Employee will be entitled to receive the stock, or, at the option
of  the  Company, the cash equivalent thereof, no later than  the
date the stock was due to be distributed had the termination  not
occurred.   Any such stock for which targets have  not  been  met
will be forfeited.

(iii)   Stock  Options.  All options to purchase shares  of  ACAH
stock  that  have  been  granted to Employee  and  that  are  not
exercisable as of the Termination Date shall terminate as of said
date.   For  all  options that are exercisable as  of  said  date
(including  options that are accelerated following  a  Change  in
Control  pursuant to the terms of a Stock Option Agreement),  the
terms  of exercise, payment, and expiration, shall be as provided
in each option agreement.
(iv)  Deferred Compensation

(a)  Absent a Change in Control.  If Employee's employment is not
terminated  upon or within twelve months following  a  Change  in
Control, the Deferred Compensation program will terminate  as  of
the  Termination Date, and the Company will not be  obligated  to
make  contributions  during  the Severance  Period.   As  of  the
Termination Date, the Company shall pay Employee an amount  equal
to  his  vested  interest  under  the  Deferred  Compensation  as
provided  in  Paragraph 5.C.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the
Company shall have a right of set-off against, and may reduce the
amount  payable as Deferred Compensation by, any amount  owed  or
payable by Employee to the Company.

(b)   Upon  a  Change  in  Control. If Employee's  employment  is
terminated  upon or within twelve months following  a  Change  in
Control,    the  Deferred  Compensation  program  will   continue
throughout   the  Severance  Period,  including   the   Company's
continuation of contributions, with all contributions to be fully
vested.   At  the end of the Severance Period, the Company  shall
pay Employee an amount equal to 100% of the Deferred Compensation
as  provided  in Paragraph 5.C.  Alternatively, the  Company  may
elect  to pay such amounts to Employee as would be payable during
the   Severance  Period  by  the  Company  under   the   Deferred
Compensation program in a single lump sum payment within  fifteen
(15)  days  after  the  Termination  Date.   Notwithstanding  the
foregoing, the Company shall have a right of set-off against, and
may  reduce the amount payable as Deferred Compensation  by,  any
amount owed or payable by Employee to the Company.

(v)  Insurance Programs.  In the event Employee's employment with
the  Company is terminated upon or within twelve months following
a Change in Control, the Split Dollar Agreement shall continue in
full  force  and  effect through the Severance Period  and  shall
survive separate and apart from this Agreement, and the Company's
obligation  to pay all premiums pursuant to this Agreement  shall
continue in accordance with the terms of this Agreement  for  the
Severance  Period.   On the Termination Date, or,  if  Employee's
employment  with the Company is terminated upon or within  twelve
months following a Change in Control, at the end of the Severance
Period, Employee shall pay to the Company an amount equal to  the
total  of  all  premiums paid by the Company on the split  dollar
policy(ies) acquired pursuant to Paragraph 5.D., without interest
thereon,  and  upon  receipt of such payment  the  Company  shall
release  its  interest in the policy, or a  portion  thereof,  on
Employee's  life  acquired pursuant to the  terms  of  the  Split
Dollar Agreement, or any or all of the paid up additions standing
to  the  credit  of such policy, if any, such that such  released
interest equals the total of all premiums paid by the Company  on
the  split dollar policy(ies) acquired pursuant to Paragraph 5.D.
Alternatively,  if  the  Company  elects  to  pay  the   Deferred
Compensation  to  Employee within fifteen  (15)  days  after  the
Termination  Date  pursuant  to Paragraph  10.E.(iv)  above,  the
Company  at  the  time  of such payment may demand  payment  from
Employee of an amount equal to the total of all premiums paid  by
the Company on the split dollar policy(ies) acquired pursuant  to
Paragraph  5.D.,  without interest thereon, and upon  receipt  of
such  payment  release  its interest in the  policy,  or  portion
thereof,  acquired  pursuant to the terms  of  the  Split  Dollar
Agreement,  and any or all of the paid up additions  standing  to
the  credit  of such policy, if any, and thereafter  the  Company
shall  be  under no obligation to pay any further premiums  under
the  Split Dollar Agreement.  Coverage under the Company's  major
medical, dental, and disability insurance plans as from  time  to
time  provided  to  other  executive  employees  of  the  Company
(including Employee's dependents) shall continue to be  paid  for
by the Company during the Severance Period in the same fashion as
prior  to  the  Termination  Date.  Provided,  however,  if  such
coverage  cannot be continued during the Severance  Period  under
the  terms of such policies or plans, the Company shall reimburse
Employee  for  the cost of comparable coverage under individually
obtained  policies  or for COBRA coverage, or  shall  make  other
arrangements to assure that Employee has comparable coverage.

(vi)  Vacation.  Vacation shall not continue to accrue after  the
Termination Date under any circumstances.

(vii)  Executive Medical Reimbursement Plan.  Reimbursement under
the Executive Medical Reimbursement Plan will terminate as of the
Termination Date.  Employee will be entitled to reimbursement for
expenses  incurred  prior to the Termination  Date  if  submitted
within three months following the Termination Date.

(viii)  Travel Benefits. Flight pass privileges currently granted
to  Employee  for travel on the Company's aircraft will  continue
for  the  Severance Period.  Employee shall not  be  entitled  to
travel benefits on any other airline.

(ix)   Deductions  for  Taxes. Subject to  Paragraph  12.D.,  any
compensation  due  to  Employee  hereunder  will  be  subject  to
deductions  for  social security, federal and  state  withholding
taxes,  and  any  other such taxes as may from time  to  time  be
required by governmental authority.

11.  Nonsolicitation, Non-Competition, and Confidentiality.

A.  Nonsolicitation and Non-Competition.  For so long as Employee
is  an  employee  of the Company, and continuing  thereafter  for
twelve months following any termination of Employee's employment,
Employee  shall  not, without the prior written  consent  of  the
Company, directly or indirectly, as a sole proprietor, member  of
a  partnership, stockholder or investor, officer or director of a
corporation, or as an employee, associate, consultant or agent of
any   person,   partnership,  corporation   or   other   business
organization  or entity other than the Company:  (i)  solicit  or
endeavor  to  entice  away  from  the  Company  or  any  of   its
subsidiaries  any person or entity who is, or,  during  the  then
most recent 12 month period, was employed by, or had served as an
agent  of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (ii) engage
in  or contract with others to engage in any business enterprise,
line   of  work  consulting  contract,  joint  venture  or  other
arrangement which conducts a business or businesses substantially
similar to the business conducted by Company in any area in which
Company  or  any  of its affiliates or subsidiaries  provides  or
plans  to  provide  air transportation to the  public.   Employee
acknowledges  that the geographic area covered  hereby,  and  the
period  and nature of the agreed restrictions are reasonable  and
necessary for the protection of the business of the Company.  All
provisions  of  this  Paragraph  concerning  non-competition  are
severable; and while it is the intention of the parties that  all
of  said provisions shall be enforceable, if any one of the  same
shall  be  held  to be unenforceable in whole  or  in  part,  the
remainder  shall  continue to be in full force and  effect.   The
provisions of clause (ii) above of this Paragraph 11.A  will  not
apply  following any termination of Employee's employment by  the
Company  other than for cause.  The terms of this Paragraph  11.A
will not apply following any termination of Employee's employment
that  was  effected as a result of, in connection with or  within
twelve  (12)  months following a Change in Control.   The  twelve
month  period  will  be deemed to mean any  notice  given  within
twelve  months following a Change in Control regardless  of  when
actual termination occurs following said notice.

B.   Confidentiality.   Employee covenants and  agrees  with  the
Company  that  he will not at any time, except in performance  of
his  obligations  to  the Company hereunder  or  with  the  prior
written  consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, disclose
any  secret or confidential information that he may learn or  has
learned by reason of his association with the Company or  any  of
its   subsidiaries   and  affiliates.   The  term   "confidential
information" includes information not previously disclosed to the
public  or to the trade by the Company's management, or otherwise
in the public domain, with respect to the Company's or any of its
affiliates'  or subsidiaries', products, facilities, applications
and  methods,  trade  secrets  and other  intellectual  property,
systems, procedures, manuals, confidential reports, price  lists,
customer  lists,  technical  information,  financial  information
(including  the  revenues, costs or profits associated  with  the
Company),  business plans, prospects or opportunities, but  shall
exclude any information which (i) is or becomes available to  the
public  or  is  generally known in the industry or industries  in
which  the  Company operates other than as a result of disclosure
by  Employee in violation of his agreements under this  Paragraph
11.B  or  (ii)  Employee  is  required  to  disclose  under   any
applicable  laws,  regulations or directives  of  any  government
agency,  tribunal or authority having jurisdiction in the  matter
or under subpoena or other process of law.

C.   Exclusive Property.  Employee confirms that all confidential
information  is  and shall remain the exclusive property  of  the
Company.  All business records, papers and documents kept or made
by  Employee relating to the business of the Company shall be and
remain  the  property  of  the Company, except  for  such  papers
customarily deemed to be the personal copies of Employee.

D.   Injunctive Relief.  Without intending to limit the  remedies
available to the Company, Employee acknowledges that a breach  of
any of the covenants contained in this Paragraph 11 may result in
material  and irreparable injury to the Company or its affiliates
or  subsidiaries for which there is no adequate  remedy  at  law,
that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries
precisely  and  that, in the event of such  a  breach  or  threat
thereof,  the  Company  shall be entitled  to  seek  a  temporary
restraining  order  and/or a preliminary or permanent  injunction
restraining  Employee from engaging in activities  prohibited  by
this  Paragraph  11  or  such other relief  as  may  be  required
specifically  to enforce any of the covenants in  this  Paragraph
11.   If  for any reason, it is held that the restrictions  under
this  Paragraph  11  are  not reasonable  or  that  consideration
therefor is inadequate, such restrictions shall be interpreted or
modified  to include as much of the duration and scope identified
in  this Paragraph 11 as will render such restrictions valid  and
enforceable.

12.  Change in Control.

A.   Definition.  As used in this Agreement, "Change in  Control"
or   "Corporate  Change"  shall  each  mean  (i)  any  merger  or
consolidation  in  which the Company shall not be  the  surviving
entity  (or  survives  only as a subsidiary  of  another  entity,
unless the stockholders of Company immediately before such merger
or   consolidation   own,  directly  or  indirectly   immediately
following such merger or consolidation, substantially all of  the
combined  voting  power of the surviving entity in  substantially
the  same  proportion as their ownership immediately before  such
merger  or  consolidation, (ii) the sale of all or  substantially
all  of the Company's assets to any other person or entity (other
than  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary),  (iii)  the  acquisition   of
beneficial   ownership   or  control   of   (including,   without
limitation,  power  to  vote) more than 50%  of  the  outstanding
shares  of  Common  Stock by any person or  entity  (including  a
"group"  as defined by or under Section 13(d)(3) of the  Exchange
Act),  (iv) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (v)  a
contested  election  of directors, as a result  of  which  or  in
connection  with  which  the persons who were  directors  of  the
Company   before  such  election  or  their  nominees  cease   to
constitute  a  majority of the Board, or  (vi)  any  other  event
specified  by  the  Compensation  Committee.    The  Compensation
Committee  reserves the right to adopt a different definition  of
Change  in  Control for stock options granted subsequent  to  the
date hereof or for any other purposes not described herein.

B.   Compensation  Upon a Change in Control.  Upon  a  Change  in
Control,  whether  or not Employee's employment  has  terminated,
Employee shall receive all of the following compensation, paid at
the time of the Change in Control:

(i)   Salary.   A  payment in the amount of  200%  of  Employee's
annual  base  salary  in  effect at the time  of  the  Change  in
Control.

(ii)    Bonus.   For  all  bonus  plans  in  which  Employee   is
participating as of a Change in Control, the Company shall pay to
Employee a lump sum bonus payout.  This payout  shall consist  of
a payment in the amount calculated by the formula [(x + y)  * z]
where (x) is Employee's base salary earned in the year of the Change
in  Control from January 1 to the date of the Change in  Control,
(y)  is  the  amount  which is two times Employee's  annual  base
salary in effect at the time of the Change in Control, and (z) is
the percentage which under each plan is the maximum percentage of
base salary that Employee was eligible to earn during the year in
which  the  Change in Control occurred assuming all targets  were
met  in full, whether or not said targets actually were met.  the
payments provided for under this Paragraph 12.B.(ii) will be paid
in cash or in such other form as bonus amounts generally are paid
to eligible employees, or in a combination thereof, as determined
by  the Compensation Committee, within thirty days following  the
Change in Control and shall be considered to be full compensation
for  all amounts due to Employee for bonus plans in which he  was
participating as of the Change in Control, and he  shall  not  be
entitled  to any further payments under any of said plans  during
the  year of participation.  Notwithstanding the above, any bonus
due  to Employee for years (or any other applicable bonus period)
completed prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs
but not yet paid shall be paid in addition to the bonus described
herein.

  (iii)  Disability Insurance.  The Company will prepay, for  two
full  years following the Change of Control, the premiums due  on
any disability insurance policy as was provided to Employee as of
the  time  of  Change in Control.  In the event that the  Company
discontinued or reduced the amount of coverage of any  disability
insurance  within  one year preceding a Change  in  Control,  the
Company  shall at the time of the Change in Control  re-establish
disability insurance to the amount previously provided  and  with
equivalent coverage, and shall prepay future premiums as provided
herein.

  (iv)   Other  Compensation.  All other compensation  separately
provided in this Agreement as due upon a Change in Control.

C.   Subsequent Termination Following a Change in Control. In the
event  that Employee's employment is terminated within  one  year
following  the  Change  in Control such that  Employee  would  be
entitled  to Severance Compensation, any amounts due at the  time
of  termination  as  Severance Compensation  under  10.E.(i)  and
10.E.(ii)  herein  shall  be reduced by any  amounts  paid  under
Paragraph 12.B.(i) and 12.B.(ii) at the time of Change in Control
(under  no circumstances would Employee be required to repay  the
amounts  paid to Employee under Paragraph 12.B.(i) or 12.B.(ii)),
but Employee will be entitled to all other Severance Compensation
as  provided  in  Paragraph  10.E. herein.   In  the  event  that
Employee's employment is terminated more than one year  following
the  Change in Control, Employee will be entitled to the benefits
provided in Paragraphs 10.E.(i) and 10.E.(ii) herein.

D.   Certain  Adjustments.  If, as a result of payments  provided
for  under or pursuant to this Agreement together with all  other
payments  in the nature of compensation provided to  or  for  the
benefit of Employee under any other agreement in connection  with
a Change in Control, any state, local or federal taxing authority
imposes  any taxes on Employee that would not be imposed on  such
payments but for the occurrence of a Change in Control, including
any  excise  tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue  Code
and  any successor or comparable provision, then, in addition  to
any  other  benefits provided under or pursuant to this Agreement
or  otherwise,  the  Company  (including  any  successor  to  the
Company) shall pay to Employee at the time any such payments  are
made under or pursuant to this or the other agreements, an amount
equal to the amount of any such taxes imposed or to be imposed on
Employee   (the  amount of any such payment, the  "Parachute  Tax
Reimbursement").   In  addition,  the  Company   (including   any
successor  to  the Company) shall "gross up" such  Parachute  Tax
Reimbursement  by  paying  to  Employee  at  the  same  time   an
additional amount equal to the aggregate amount of any additional
taxes   (whether  income  taxes,  excise  taxes,  special  taxes,
employment  taxes or otherwise) that are or will  be  payable  by
Employee  as  a  result of the Parachute Tax Reimbursement  being
paid  or payable to Employee and/or as a result of the additional
amounts  paid  or payable to Employee pursuant to this  sentence,
such  that after payment of such additional taxes Employee  shall
have  been paid on a net after-tax basis an amount equal  to  the
Parachute  Tax  Reimbursement.  The amount of any  Parachute  Tax
Reimbursement  and  of  any  such  gross-up  amounts   shall   be
determined  by  the  Company's independent auditing  firm,  whose
determination,  absent  manifest  error,  shall  be  treated   as
conclusive  and  binding  absent a  binding  determination  by  a
governmental taxing authority that a greater amount of taxes  are
payable by Employee.

13.  Assignment.  This Agreement, as it relates to the employment
of  Employee, is a personal contract and the rights and interests
of  Employee  hereunder  may not be sold, transferred,  assigned,
pledged or hypothecated.  However, this Agreement shall inure  to
the benefit of and be binding upon Company and its successors and
assigns  including, without limitation, any corporation or  other
entity  into  which Company is merged or which  acquires  all  or
substantially all of the outstanding common stock  or  assets  of
Company.  Company may provide, without the prior written  consent
of  Employee,  that Employee shall be employed pursuant  to  this
Agreement  by any of its affiliates instead of or in addition  to
Company,  and in such case all references herein to the "Company"
shall  be  deemed to include any such entity, provided that  such
action  shall not relieve Company of its obligation  to  make  or
cause  an affiliate to make or provide for any payment to  or  on
behalf of Employee pursuant to this Agreement.

14.   Invalid Provisions.  The invalidity of any one or  more  of
the  paragraphs or provisions of this Agreement shall not  affect
the  reasonable  enforceability of the  remaining  paragraphs  or
provisions  of  this Agreement, all of which are inserted  herein
conditionally upon being valid in law; and in the  event  one  or
more  of  the paragraphs or provisions contained herein shall  be
invalid,  this instrument shall be construed as if  such  invalid
paragraphs or provisions had not been inserted or, alternatively,
said paragraphs or provisions shall be reasonably limited to  the
extent  that the applicable court interpreting the provisions  of
this Agreement considers to be reasonable.

15.   Specific  Performance.  The parties hereby agree  that  any
violation  by Employee of the covenants and agreements  contained
herein  shall  cause irreparable damage to the Company,  and  the
Company  may,  as  a matter of course, enjoin and  restrain  said
violation  by  Employee  by process issued  out  of  a  court  of
competent  jurisdiction, in addition to any other  remedies  that
said court may see fit to award.

16.   Binding Effect.  All the terms of this Agreement  shall  be
binding  upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto  and
their respective legal representatives, successors and assigns.

17.   Waiver  of Breach or Violation Not Deemed Continuing.   The
waiver  by the Company of any provision of this Agreement may  be
effected only by a written waiver duly executed on behalf of  the
Company  and except to the extent specifically provided  in  such
waiver  shall not operate as, or be construed to be, a waiver  of
any subsequent breach hereof.

18.   Entire Agreement; Law Governing.  This Agreement supersedes
in  its entirety the terms of the Severance Agreement between the
parties  dated  as  of  _____________  and  any  and  all   other
agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties hereto
with  respect  to the subject matter hereof, by and  between  the
Company  and  Employee,  and  contains  all  the  covenants   and
agreements among the parties with respect to such subject matter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that  the  Company's
Deferred Compensation contributions or any other compensation  or
benefit  provided  for hereunder was paid, granted,  credited  or
funded under and pursuant to an earlier version of this Agreement
with  respect to service prior to the Effective Date and at rates
provided  for  under such earlier version, then such compensation
or   benefit   need  not  be  again  paid,  granted  or   funded,
respectively,  pursuant to this Agreement.  This Agreement  shall
be  construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth  of
Virginia,  without  regard to principles  of  conflicts  of  law.
Employee hereby acknowledges that he was given the opportunity to
be  represented  by counsel of his choosing in the  drafting  and
negotiation   of  this  Agreement  and  that  he  reviewed   this
Agreement.  In  interpreting this Agreement, a  court  shall  not
treat either party as the draftsman of the Agreement.

19.   Paragraph  Headings.  The Paragraph headings  contained  in
this Agreement are for convenience only and shall in no manner be
construed as a part of this Agreement.

20.   Release  by  Employee.  In the event of  a  termination  of
employment  by Employee that results in the payment of  Severance
Compensation  to him pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,  in
consideration for such Severance Compensation and as a  condition
precedent  to  the  payment thereof, Employee  hereby  agrees  to
execute a full and complete release to the Company releasing  any
and all claims that he may have against the Company including any
claims relating to his termination of employment.

21.   Notices.   All notices permitted or required  to  be  given
pursuant  to  this  Agreement shall be in writing  and  shall  be
deemed  to  have been sufficiently given, subject to the  further
provisions of this Paragraph 21, for all purposes when  presented
personally  to  such party (which in the case of  notice  to  the
Company,  shall be presented to the person holding the office  or
offices identified below) or sent by facsimile transmission,  any
national  overnight delivery service, or certified or  registered
mail, to such party at its address set forth below:

If  to  Employee,  to  the  most  recent  address  indicated  for
Employee's residence in the personnel records of Company,  unless

the  next  business day after the date sent if sent by a national
overnight  delivery service, or five (5) business days after  the

address  shall  also  be  given in the manner  set  forth  above.
Whenever  the  giving of notice is required, the giving  of  such
notice  may be waived in writing by the party entitled to receive
such notice.

In   Witness  Whereof,  the  Company  has  hereunto  caused  this
Agreement  to  be  executed  by  a duly  authorized  officer  and
Employee  has hereunto set his hand as of the day and year  first
above written.

Exhibit 10.12(d)

December 28, 2001

[Addressee
(Senior Executive Officer)]


Re:  Voluntary Reduction in Base Salary

Dear _____________:

As you know, as a result of the events affecting our industry, we
have  sought voluntary pay reductions from our senior executives.
By  signing this agreement, you acknowledge that your base salary
(also  known as base pay) shall be and has been reduced  from  an
annual  rate  of  $______________ to $___________ (the  "adjusted
annual  salary")  commencing on October 1,  2001  and  continuing
until  such  time as the Compensation Committee of the  Board  of
Directors determines that it is appropriate to restore levels  of
Compensation to the previous amounts.

During  this period, the adjusted annual salary shall be utilized
for  calculating the amount of your paychecks and for  all  other
purposes (including, for example, for purposes of calculating tax
withholding,  and  for  purposes  of  calculating  any   bonuses,
deferred  compensation,  split dollar  life  payments,  and  401K
contributions), except that for purposes of calculating severance
benefits, [retirement pay], or benefits upon a change of control,
your benefits shall be calculated as if your base salary had  not
been reduced pursuant to this letter agreement.  [In light of the
reduction   in  your  salary,  the  Compensation  Committee   has
determined  that for so long as such reduction is in effect,  the
Company  will  credit your deferred compensation account  at  the
rate  of ___________ percent (___%) of your adjusted base salary,
and  the  Company  will  pay  an equivalent  percentage  of  your
adjusted  base salary to fund premiums on your split dollar  life
insurance  policy.]  This agreement constitutes an  amendment  to
any  severance or benefit agreement between you and the  Company,
including the Severance Agreement dated _____________, 2001,  but
except  as expressly provided herein does not otherwise supercede
or amend any such agreement.

The offer of the terms as described in this letter is conditioned
upon  your acknowledgment and acceptance of these terms  by  your
return  to  the  Company of a copy of this letter signed  in  the
place indicated below.


                          ATLANTIC COAST AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC.

<PAGE> 20

     (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this

          shall have occurred a Default, which Default shall not have
          been cured or waived.

     (e)  In the event that a Notice of Borrowing fails to specify
          whether the Revolving Credit Loans comprising such Borrowing
          are to be Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Rate Loans, such Loans
          shall be made as Base Rate Loans.

request to extend the Termination Date).

and  fees  for  purposes of Section 2.07, the  Borrower  and  the

notice to that effect, which notice shall set forth in reasonable

decreased  pursuant to this Section 2.06 or  Section  2.07  if  a
Default  is in existence on the Performance Pricing Determination
Date.

     (b)  Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is
made  until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate  for  such  day plus the Applicable Margin.   Such  interest
shall  be payable in arrears on the first day of each month while
such Base Rate Loan is outstanding and on the date such Base Rate
Loan is converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan.  Any overdue principal of
and,  to the extent permitted by applicable law, overdue interest
on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for
each  day  until  paid at a rate per annum equal to  the  Default
Rate.

     (c)  Each LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of
the Daily LIBOR Rate in effective from time to time plus the
Applicable Margin.  Such interest shall be payable monthly in

is outstanding.  Any overdue principal of and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest on any LIBOR Rate Loan shall

Borrower and the Lender by telecopier of each rate of interest so
determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error.  The applicable rate of interest
for all LIBOR Rate Loans shall be increased or decreased, as the
case may be, by an amount equal to any increase or decrease in
the Daily LIBOR Rate, with such adjustments to be effective as of
the opening day of business on the day that any such change in
the Daily LIBOR Rate becomes effective.

     (e)  After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, the principal amount of the Loans (and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, all accrued interest thereon) may,
at the election of the Lender, bear interest at the Default Rate.

     SECTION 2.07   Commitment Fee.

   The Borrower shall pay to the Lender a commitment fee equal to
the product of (i) the aggregate of the daily average amounts  of
the  Lender's  Unused  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  during  the
applicable period, times (ii) a per annum percentage equal to the
Applicable  Commitment  Fee  Rate.   Such  commitment  fee  shall
accrue  from and including the Closing Date to and including  the
Termination Date.  Commitment fees shall be payable quarterly  in
arrears  on the first Commitment Fee Payment Date following  each
Commitment  Fee  Determination Date and on the Termination  Date;
provided   that   should  the  Revolving  Credit  Commitment   be
terminated at any time prior to the

<PAGE> 22

Termination  Date  for any reason the entire accrued  and  unpaid
commitment fee through the date of termination shall be  paid  on
the  date  of  such termination.  The "Applicable Commitment  Fee
Rate"  shall  be determined quarterly based upon the Consolidated
Fixed  Charges Coverage Ratio for the Loan Parties,  collectively
on a combined basis, calculated as of the last day of each Fiscal
Quarter, as follows:

<TABLE>

            Less than or equal to           .375%
            1.8 to 1.0

            Greater than 2.25  to           .20%
            1.0

</TABLE>

The  Applicable Commitment Fee Rate shall be determined effective
as  of  the date (herein, the Commitment Fee Determination Date")
which  is  45  days after the last day of the Fiscal Quarter  for
which  the  Consolidated Fixed Charges Coverage  Ratio  is  being
determined, based on the quarterly financial statements for  such
Fiscal  Quarter,  and  the  Applicable  Commitment  Fee  Rate  so
determined  shall  remain  effective  from  such  Commitment  Fee
Determination Date until the date which is 45 days after the last
day   of  the  Fiscal  Quarter  in  which  such  Commitment   Fee
Determination  Date  falls (which latter  date  shall  be  a  new
Commitment  Fee Determination Date); provided that  (i)  for  the
period  from and including the Closing Date to but excluding  the
Commitment  Fee  Determination Date  next  following  the  Fiscal
Quarter  ending December 31, 2001, the Applicable Commitment  Fee
Rate  shall  be  0.375%;  (ii) in the  case  of  any   Applicable
Commitment  Fee Rate determined for the fourth and  final  Fiscal
Quarter  of a Fiscal Year, the Commitment Fee Determination  Date
shall  be  the date which is 90 days after the last day  of  such
Fiscal Quarter and such  Applicable Commitment Fee Rate shall  be
determined  based upon the consolidated annual audited  financial
statements of the Loan Parties for the Fiscal Year ended  on  the
last  day  of  such final Fiscal Quarter, and  (iii)  if  on  any
Commitment  Fee  Determination Date the Loan Parties  shall  have
failed to deliver to the Lender the financial statements required
to  be  delivered  pursuant to Sections 6.01(a) or  6.01(b)  with
respect to the Fiscal Year or Fiscal Quarter most recently  ended
prior  to  such Commitment Fee Determination Date, then  for  the
period  beginning on such Commitment Fee Determination  Date  and
ending  on the earlier of (A) the date on which the Loan  Parties
shall  deliver  to  the  Lender the financial  statements  to  be
delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(b) with respect to such Fiscal
Quarter  or  any subsequent Fiscal Quarter, and (B) the  date  on
which  the  Loan  Parties  shall deliver  to  the  Lender  annual
financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section
6.01(a)  with  respect  to the Fiscal Year  which  includes  such
Fiscal  Quarter  or  any subsequent Fiscal Year,  the  Applicable
Commitment  Fee  Rate shall be determined as if the  Consolidated
Fixed Charges Coverage Ratio was less than or equal to 1.8 to 1.0
at  all  times  during such period; provided that the  Applicable
Commitment Fee

<PAGE> 23

shall not be decreased pursuant to this Section 2.07 if a Default
is in existence on the related Commitment Fee Determination Date,
unless and until such Default shall have been cured or waived  in
writing.

     SECTION 2.08   Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitment.

   The Borrower may, upon at least 3 Business Days' notice to the
Lender,  terminate  at  any time, or proportionately  reduce  the
Unused  Revolving  Credit Commitment from  time  to  time  by  an

multiple of $1,000,000.  If the Commitment is terminated  in  its
entirety, all accrued fees (as provided under Section 2.07) shall
be due and payable on the effective date of such termination.

     SECTION 2.09   Mandatory Reduction and Termination of Commitment.

or  from  time  to time in part in amounts aggregating  at  least
$500,000,  by paying the principal amount to be prepaid  together
with  accrued  interest thereon to the date of prepayment.   Each
such  optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably  the
Base Rate Loans included in such Base Rate Borrowing.

     (b)  Subject to any payments required pursuant to the terms of
Article IX for such LIBOR Rate Loan, upon 3 Business Day's prior
written notice, the Borrower may prepay in minimum amounts of
$500,000 (or any lesser amount equal to the outstanding balance
of such Loan) all or any portion of the principal amount of any
LIBOR Rate Loan prior to the maturity thereof.
(c)  A notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.10, once
received by the Lender, shall not thereafter be revocable by the
Borrower.

     SECTION 2.11   Mandatory Prepayments.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere
in  this  Agreement,  if  an Overadvance Condition  shall  exist,
Borrower  shall,  without the necessity of a demand,  either  (a)
repay  the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans that are Base  Rate
Loans  or LIBOR Rate Loans in an amount sufficient to reduce  the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of all such Loans by an  amount
equal to such excess; or (b) deposit with Lender, for application
to  any outstanding Revolving Credit Loans as the same become due
and   payable,  cash  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  cure   such
Overadvance  Condition,  to  be  held  by  Lender  in  the   Cash
Collateral  Account, pending disbursement of same to Lender,  but
subject  to  Lender's  Lien therein and  rights  of  offset  with
respect thereto.

counterclaim  or any deduction whatsoever, not later  than  11:00
a.m. (McLean, Virginia time) on the date when due, in Federal  or
other  funds  immediately available in McLean, Virginia,  to  the
Lender at its address referred to in Section 9.01.

     (b)  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the

is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  Whenever any

     (c)  All payments of principal, interest and fees and all other
amounts to be made by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to any Revolving Credit Loan, Reimbursement
Obligation or fee relating thereto shall be paid without
deduction for, and free from, any taxes, imposts, levies, duties,

event that the Borrower is required by applicable law to make any
such withholding or deduction of Taxes with respect to any Loan
or fee or other amount, the Borrower shall pay such deduction or
withholding to the applicable taxing authority, shall promptly
furnish to the Lender in respect of which such deduction or
withholding is made all receipts and other documents evidencing
such payment and shall pay to the Lender additional amounts as
may be necessary in order that the amount received by the Lender
after the required withholding or other payment shall equal the
amount the Lender would have received had no such withholding or
other payment been made.
     In  the event the Lender receives a refund of any Taxes paid
by  the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.12(c), it will pay to
the  Borrower  the  amount of such refund promptly  upon  receipt
thereof;  provided that if at any time thereafter it is  required
to  return such refund, the Borrower shall promptly repay  to  it
the amount of such refund.

     Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement  of
the  Borrower  hereunder, the agreements and obligations  of  the
Borrower  and the Lender contained in this Section 2.12(c)  shall
constitute   a  continuing  agreement  and  shall   survive   the
termination  of  this  Agreement  and  the  payment  in  full  or
cancellation of the Note.

     SECTION 2.13   Computation of Interest and Fees.

   Interest on Base Rate Loans based on the Prime Rate  shall  be
computed  on  the  basis  of  a year  of  365  or  366  days,  as

     (a)  Reimbursement.  Notwithstanding any provisions to the
contrary  in the Reimbursement Agreement or any Letter of  Credit

         (i)  the Borrower shall reimburse the Lender for drawings under a
              Letter of Credit issued by it no later than the earlier of (A)
              the time specified in such Letter of Credit Application
              Agreement, or (B) 1 Business Day after the payment by the
              Lender;

        (ii)  any Reimbursement Obligation with respect to any Letter of
              Credit shall bear interest from the date of the relevant
              drawing under the pertinent Letter of Credit until the date
              of payment in full thereof at a rate per annum equal to (A)
              prior to the date that is 3 Business Days after the date of
              the related payment by the Lender, the Base Rate plus the
              Applicable Margin and (B) thereafter, the Default Rate; and

       (iii)  in order to implement the foregoing, upon the
              occurrence of a draw under any Letter of Credit, unless the
              Lender is reimbursed in accordance with Subsection (i) above,
              the Borrower irrevocably authorizes the Lender to treat such
              nonpayment as a Notice of Borrowing in the amount of such
              Reimbursement Obligation and the Lender to make a Base Rate
              Loan to Borrower in such amount regardless of whether the
              conditions precedent to the making of Base Rate Loans
              hereunder have been met.  The Borrower further authorizes
              the Lender to credit the proceeds of such Base Rate Loan so
              as to immediately eliminate the liability of the Borrower
              for Reimbursement Obligations under such Letter of Credit.

     (b)  Duties of the Lender.  Any action taken or omitted to be
taken  by the Lender in connection with any Letter of Credit,  if
taken  or  omitted in the absence of willful misconduct or  gross
negligence,  shall  not  put  the  Lender  under  any   resulting
liability to any Loan Party.  In

<PAGE> 29

determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the Lender
shall  have no obligation relative to any Loan Party, other  than
to  confirm  that any documents required to have  been  delivered
under  such Letter of Credit appear to comply on their face  with
the requirements of such Letter of Credit.

     SECTION 4.06   [Intentionally Omitted].

     SECTION 4.07   Payment of Reimbursement Obligations.

other  amounts payable to the Lender under or in connection  with
any  Letter  of  Credit  issued for the Borrower's  or  any  Loan
Party's account immediately when due, irrespective of:

            (i)  any lack of validity or enforceability of this
                 Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;

           (ii)  the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or
                 other right which the Borrower or any Loan Party may
                 have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter
                 of Credit or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or
                 any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting),
                 the Lender, or any other Person, whether in connection with
                 this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions
                 contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions;

          (iii)  any draft, certificate or any other document presented
                 under the Letter of Credit proves to be forged, fraudulent,
                 invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
                 therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

           (iv)  the surrender or impairment of any security for the
                 performance or observance of any of the terms of any of
                 the Loan Documents;

            (v)  payment by the Lender under any Letter of Credit proving to
                 be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
                 respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate
                 in any respect;

           (vi)  payment by the Lender under any Letter of Credit against
                 presentation of any draft or certificate that does not comply
                 with the terms of such Letter of Credit, except payment
                 resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
                 the Lender; or

          (vii)  any other circumstances or happenings whatsoever,
                 whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, except
                 circumstances or happenings resulting from the gross
                 negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender.

Credit,  payable  on  the Business Day on which  such  Letter  of
Credit  is  issued  and every six months thereafter.   Letter  of
Credit Fees payable hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year  of  360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed

against  any  and  all  claims,  demands,  liabilities,  damages,
losses,   costs,  charges  and  expenses  (including   reasonable
attorneys' fees) which the Lender may incur or be subject to as a
consequence  of  the issuance of any Letter  of  Credit  for  the
Borrower's account other than as a result of its gross negligence
or  willful  misconduct, as determined by a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction.

beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.  In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Lender shall not be
responsible for (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any
party in connection with the application for and issuance of the
Letters of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any
or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or
forged, (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or
ineffective for any reason, (iii) failure of the beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit to comply duly with conditions required in order
to draw upon such Letter of Credit, (iv) errors, omissions,
interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether

proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; and (viii)
any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the
Lender.

limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any
action taken or omitted by the Lender under or in connection with
the Letters of Credit or any related certificates if taken or
omitted in good faith
<PAGE> 31

and  with  reasonable care, shall not put the  Lender  under  any
resulting liability to the Borrower or any Loan Party or  relieve
the  Borrower  of any of its obligations hereunder  to  any  such
Person.

the  nature of its business, such qualification is necessary, and
has   all   corporate  powers  and  all  governmental   licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry  on  its
business as now conducted, except in each case where such failure
to be so qualified or have such powers, licenses, authorizations,

FAA under 49 U.S.C. 44705.

     SECTION 5.02   Corporate and Governmental Authorization;  No

   This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Borrower  enforceable in accordance with its terms, and the  Note
and  the  other  Loan Documents, when executed and  delivered  in
accordance with this Agreement, will constitute valid and binding
obligations of the Borrower enforceable in accordance with  their
respective  terms,  provided that the enforceability  hereof  and
thereof  is subject in each case to general principles of  equity
and  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency and similar laws  affecting  the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

     SECTION 5.04   Financial Information.

          (a)  The consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and the related

planned,  its relationships with its major airline partners,  and
its  costs of operations including insurance and security  costs.
Otherwise,  since  June 30, 2001 there has been  no  event,  act,
condition  or  occurrence having, or which  could  reasonably  be
expected  to have, alone or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse
Effect.

     SECTION 5.05   No Litigation.

   There  is  no action, suit or proceeding pending,  or  to  the
knowledge  of the Loan Parties' threatened, against or  affecting
Holdings  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  before  any  court   or
arbitrator  or  any governmental body, agency or official  which,
alone or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material  Adverse   Effect  or which in  any  manner  draws  into
question the validity of or could impair the ability of the  Loan
Parties  to  perform  their respective  obligations  under,  this
Agreement, the Note or any of the other Loan Documents.

     SECTION 5.06   Compliance with ERISA.

          (a)  Holdings and Borrower have fulfilled their obligations under

state,  local and foreign income, excise, property and other  tax
returns which are required to be filed by them and to the best of
Holdings'  knowledge, all taxes due pursuant to such  returns  or

                           ARTICLE IX.
                     CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

     SECTION 9.01   Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or
Unfair.

   If on or prior to the first day of any LIBOR Rate Loan:

          (a)  the Lender determines that deposits in Dollars (in the
applicable amounts) are not being offered in the relevant market,
or

          (b)  the London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the
Lender will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the
Lender of funding LIBOR Rate Loans,
the  Lender shall forthwith give notice thereof to the  Borrower,
whereupon  until  the  Lender  notifies  the  Borrower  that  the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the
obligation  of the Lender to make LIBOR Rate Loans  specified  in
such notice, or to permit continuations or conversions into LIBOR
Rate Loans, shall be suspended.  Unless the Borrower notifies the
Lender  at least 2 Business Days before the date of any Borrowing
of  LIBOR  Rate  Loans  for  which  a  Notice  of  Borrowing  has
previously  been given, or continuation or conversion  into  such
LIBOR Rate Loans for which a Notice of Continuation or Conversion
has  previously been given, that it elects not to  borrow  or  so
continue or convert on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be
made  as a Base Rate Borrowing, or such LIBOR Rate Loan shall  be
converted to a Base Rate Loan.

     SECTION 9.02   Illegality.

   If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law,
rule  or  regulation, or any change therein or  any  existing  or
future   law,   rule  or  regulation,  or  any  change   in   the
interpretation  or  administration thereof  by  any  governmental
authority,  central bank or comparable agency  charged  with  the
interpretation or administration thereof (any such  agency  being
referred to as an "Governing Authority" and any such event  being
referred  to as a "Change of Law"), or compliance by  the  Lender
(or its Lending Office) with any request or

<PAGE> 44

directive  (whether  or  not having the  force  of  law)  of  any
Governing Authority shall make it unlawful or impossible for  the
Lender  (or  its Lending Office) to make, maintain  or  fund  its
LIBOR  Rate Loans, the Lender shall forthwith give notice thereof
to the Borrower, whereupon until the Lender notifies the Borrower
that  the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no  longer
exist,   the  obligation  of  the  Lender  to  make   or   permit
continuations  or  conversions  of  LIBOR  Rate  Loans  shall  be
suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Borrower pursuant  to
this  Section,  the  Lender shall designate a  different  Lending
Office  if  such designation will avoid the need for giving  such
notice  and will not, in the judgment of the Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous  to  the Lender.  If the Lender  shall  determine
that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its
outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans to maturity, and shall so specify in
such  notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in  full  the
then outstanding principal amount of each LIBOR Rate Loan of  the
Lender, together with accrued interest thereon.

     SECTION 9.03   Increased Cost and Reduced Return.

     (a)  If after the date hereof, a Change of Law or compliance by
the  Lender (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive
(whether  or  not  having  the force of  law)  of  any  Governing
Authority:

       (i)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
            special deposit or similar requirement (including,
            without limitation, any such requirement imposed by
            the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
            but excluding with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan any
            such requirement included in an applicable LIBOR
            Rate Reserve Percentage) against assets of, deposits with
            or for the account of, or credit extended by, the Lender
            (or its Lending Office); or

      (ii)  shall impose on the Lender (or its Lending Office) or on
            the London interbank market any other condition affecting its
            LIBOR Rate Loans, its Note or its obligation to make LIBOR
            Rate Loans; and the result of any of the foregoing is to
            increase the cost to the  Lender (or its Lending Office) of
            making or maintaining the Loan, or to reduce the amount of any
            sum received or receivable by the Lender (or its Lending
            Office) under this  Agreement or under its Note with respect
            thereto, by an amount deemed by the Lender to be material, then
            the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrower within 90
            days after the Lender becomes aware of such matters and,
            within 15 days after demand by the Lender, the Borrower shall
            pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
            compensate the Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

    (b)  If the Lender shall have determined that after the date
hereof  the  adoption of any applicable law, rule  or  regulation
regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any  change
in the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by
the Lender (or its Lending Office or the bank holding company  of
which  the  Lender is a subsidiary) with any request or directive
regarding  capital adequacy (whether or not having the  force  of
law) of any Governing Authority, has or would have the effect  of
reducing the rate of return on the Lender's (or such bank holding
company's) capital as a consequence of its obligations  hereunder
to  a  level  below that which the Lender (or such  bank  holding
company)  could  have achieved but for such adoption,  change  or
compliance (taking into consideration the Lender's (or such  bank
holding

<PAGE> 45

company's)  policies  with respect to  capital  adequacy)  by  an
amount  deemed by the Lender to be material, then  from  time  to
time  the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrower within
90  days  after  the  Lender becomes aware of such  matters  and,
within 15 days after demand by the Lender, the Borrower shall pay
to   the  Lender  such  additional  amount  or  amounts  as  will
compensate  the  Lender (or such bank holding company)  for  such
reduction.

          (c)  The Lender will promptly notify the Borrower of any event of
which  it  has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof,  which
will  entitle the Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section
and will designate a different Lending Office if such designation
will   avoid  the  need  for,  or  reduce  the  amount  of,  such
compensation  and  will not, in the judgment of  the  Lender,  be
otherwise  disadvantageous to the Lender.  A certificate  of  the
Lender claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth
the  additional  amount or  amounts to be paid  to  it  hereunder
shall  be  conclusive  in  the absence  of  manifest  error.   In
determining  such  amount,  the Lender  may  use  any  reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

          (d)  The provisions of this Section 9.03 shall be applicable with
respect to any Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and any
calculations required by such provisions shall be made based upon
the circumstances of such Participant, Assignee or other
Transferee.  The Lender agrees that it will not seek compensation
or reimbursement provided for in this Section 9.03 unless the
Lender as a matter of policy intends generally to seek comparable
compensation or reimbursement from other borrowers similarly
situated and with similarly documented financial accommodations.

     SECTION 9.04   Base Rate Loans Substituted for LIBOR Rate Loans.

   If  (i) the obligation of the Lender to make or maintain LIBOR
Rate  Loans  has  been  suspended pursuant  to  Section  9.02  or
(ii) the Lender has demanded compensation under Section 9.03, and
the Borrower shall, by at least 5 Business Days' prior notice  to
the  Lender,  have elected that the provisions  of  this  Section
shall  apply,  then,  unless and until the  Lender  notifies  the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or
demand for compensation no longer apply:

          (a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made by the Lender as, or
permitted  to be continued as or converted into LIBOR Rate  Loans
shall instead be made as or converted into Base Rate Loans, and

          (b)  after each of its LIBOR Rate Loans has been repaid, all
payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay
such LIBOR Rate Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate
Loans instead.

     SECTION 9.05   Compensation.

   [Intentionally Omitted]

owed  by  Borrower  to  Lender and  in  order  to  secure  prompt
performance  of any and all other Obligations to be performed  by
Borrower, Borrower

<PAGE> 46

hereby  grants  to Lender a continuing security interest  in  and
lien upon the Collateral, whether now owned or existing or at any
time  hereafter acquired, arising or created by Borrower, subject

Collateral  now owned or hereafter acquired by the  Borrower  and
the  Borrower hereby authorizes the Lender to file such financing
statements.   Said  financing statements may  contain  a  generic
description  of  collateral that is broader than  the  collateral
description contained in the security agreement set forth  herein
except  with  respect  to Collateral constituting  Rotable  Spare
Parts.   Borrower  will perform, or will cause to  be  performed,
upon  the  reasonable  request of Lender, each  and  all  of  the
following:

          (a)  Record, register and file a chattel mortgage and
     security agreement securing the Rotable Spare Parts, as well
     as such notices, financing statements and other documents or
     instruments as may from time to time be reasonably requested
     by Lender to fully carry out the intent of this Agreement,
     with the FAA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and such other
     administrations or governmental agencies, whether domestic
     or foreign, as may be reasonably determined by Lender to be
     necessary or advisable in order to perfect, establish,
     confirm and maintain the security interest and lien created
     hereunder, as a legal, valid and binding security interest
     and lien upon the Collateral;

          (b)  Furnish to Lender evidence of every such
     recording, registering and filing; and

          (c)   Execute  and deliver or perform, or cause  to  be
     executed and delivered or performed, such further and  other
     instruments  and  acts as Lender reasonably  determines  are
     necessary  or  required to fully carry out  the  intent  and
     purpose  of  this Agreement or to subject the Collateral  to
     the security interest and lien created hereunder, including,
     without  limitation: (i) any and all acts and  things  which
     may  be  reasonably  requested by  Lender  with  respect  to
     complying with the laws and regulations of the FAA; and (ii)
     defending the title of Borrower to the Collateral  by  means
     of   negotiation   and,  if  necessary,  appropriate   legal
     proceedings,  against  each and  every  Person  claiming  an
     interest therein contrary or adverse to Borrower's title  to
     same.

     SECTION 10.03  Power of Attorney.

   Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Lender as its
attorney-in-fact and agent with full power of substitution and re-

payments; and (e) to execute in Borrower's name and file any
notices, financing statements and other documents or instruments
Lender determines are necessary or required to fully carry out
the intent and purpose of this Agreement or to perfect Lender's

appointment of Lender as Borrower's attorney-in-fact, and each
and every one of Lender's rights and powers in connection
therewith, being coupled with any interest, are and shall remain
irrevocable during the continuance of an Event of Default until
all of the Obligations have been paid and performed.

                          MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 11.01  Notices.

   All  notices, requests and other communications to  any  party
hereunder  shall be in writing (including telecopier  or  similar
writing)  and  shall be given to such party  at  its  address  or
telecopier number set forth on the signature pages hereof or such
other  address  or telecopier number as such party may  hereafter
specify for the purpose by notice to each other party.  Each such
notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i)  if
given  by  telecopier, when such telecopy is transmitted  to  the
telecopier  number specified in this Section and the confirmation
is  received,  (ii)  if  given  by  mail,  72  hours  after  such
communication is deposited in the mails with first class  postage
prepaid,  addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by  any  other
means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section.

     SECTION 11.02  No Waivers.

   No  failure  or delay by the Lender in exercising  any  right,
power  or  privilege hereunder or under any Note  or  other  Loan
Document  shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any  single
or  partial  exercise  thereof  preclude  any  other  or  further
exercise  thereof or the exercise of any other  right,  power  or
privilege.   The  rights and remedies herein  provided  shall  be
cumulative  and not exclusive of any rights or remedies  provided
by law.

     SECTION 11.03  Expenses; Documentary Taxes.

   The  Borrower shall pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of  the
Lender,  including fees and disbursements of special counsel  for
the  Lender, in connection with the preparation of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, any waiver or consent hereunder  or
thereunder  or any amendment hereof or thereof or any Default  or
alleged  Default hereunder or thereunder and (ii)  if  a  Default
occurs,  all  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  the  Lender,
including  fees and disbursements of counsel, in connection  with
such  Default  and  collection and other enforcement  proceedings
resulting therefrom, including out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
enforcing  this  Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents.   The
Borrower  shall indemnify the Lender against any transfer  taxes,
documentary  taxes, assessments or charges made by any  Governing
Authority  by  reason  of  the execution  and  delivery  of  this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

     SECTION 11.04  Indemnification.

   The  Borrower  shall indemnify the Lender and  each  Affiliate
thereof  and  its  respective directors, officers  and  employees
from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses,
liabilities,  claims or damages to which any of them  may  become
subject,  insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims or  damages
arise out of or result from any transaction contemplated by  this
Agreement  or any other Loan Document or any actual  or  proposed
use by the Borrower of the proceeds of any extension of credit by
the Lender

<PAGE> 48

hereunder  or  breach by the Borrower of this  Agreement  or  any
other   Loan  Document  or  from  any  investigation,  litigation
(including, without limitation, any actions taken by  the  Lender
or  to enforce this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents)
or   other   proceeding  (including,  without   limitation,   any
threatened   investigation  or  proceeding)   relating   to   the
foregoing, and the Borrower shall reimburse the Lender, and  each
Affiliate  thereof  and its respective directors,  officers,  and
employees,  upon  demand  for  any expenses  (including,  without
limitation,  legal  fees) incurred in connection  with  any  such
investigation  or  proceeding; but  excluding  any  such  losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses which are determined  by
a final, non-appealable judgment of a court to have been incurred
by  reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct  of  the
Person  to  be  indemnified.  In the case of  any  investigation,
litigation  or  other proceeding to which the indemnity  in  this
Section applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not
such  investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought  by  the
Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, or any of  their
respective   directors,  shareholders,   or   creditors   or   an
Indemnified  Party, or any other Person or any Indemnified  Party
is  otherwise a party thereto and whether or not any  transaction
contemplated  by  this Agreement or any other  Loan  Document  is
consummated.

     SECTION 11.05  Setoff; Sharing of Setoffs.

          (a)  The Borrower hereby grants to the Lender a lien for all
indebtedness and obligations owing to them from the Borrower upon
all deposits or deposit accounts, of any kind, or any interest in
any  deposits  or  deposit  accounts thereof,  now  or  hereafter
pledged,  mortgaged, transferred or assigned  to  the  Lender  or
otherwise  in  the possession or control of the  Lender  for  any
purpose  for the account or benefit of the Borrower and including
any  balance  of  any deposit account or of  any  credit  of  the
Borrower  with  the  Lender, whether now  existing  or  hereafter
established, hereby authorizing the Lender at any time  or  times
with  or without prior notice to apply such balances or any  part
thereof to such of the indebtedness and obligations owing by  the
Borrower to the Lender then past due and in such amounts as  they
may  elect,  and whether or not the Collateral, if  any,  or  the
responsibility   of  other  Persons  primarily,  secondarily   or
otherwise  liable may be deemed adequate.  For  the  purposes  of
this  paragraph, all remittances and property shall be deemed  to
be in the possession of the Lender as soon as the same may be put
in transit to it by mail or carrier or by other bailee.

          (b)   The  Borrower  agrees, to the fullest  extent  it  may
effectively  do  so under applicable law, that any  holder  of  a
participation  in the Note, whether or not acquired  pursuant  to
the  foregoing  arrangements, may exercise rights  of  setoff  or
counterclaim  and other rights with respect to such participation
as  fully  as  if such holder of a participation  were  a  direct
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

     SECTION 11.06  Amendments and Waivers.

   Any  provision of this Agreement, the Note or any  other  Loan
Documents  may  be  amended  or waived  if,  but  only  if,  such
amendment  or waiver is in writing and is signed by the  Borrower
and the Lender.

     SECTION 11.07  Independence of Covenants.

   All covenants under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall  be given independent effect so that if a particular action
or condition is not permitted by any such covenant, the fact that
it would be permitted by an

<PAGE> 49

exception to, or would be otherwise allowed by, another  covenant
shall  not  avoid the occurrence of a Default if such  action  is
taken or such condition exists.

     SECTION 11.08  Successors and Assigns.

          (a)  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure  to  the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; provided that the Borrower may not assign
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement.

          (b)  The Lender may at any time sell to one or more financial
institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in
any Loan owing to the Lender, the Note held by the Lender, the
Commitment hereunder or any other interest of the Lender
hereunder.  In the event of any such sale by the Lender of a
participating interest to a Participant, the Lender's obligations
under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, the Lender shall
remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, the Lender
shall remain the holder of the Note for all purposes under this
Agreement, and the Borrower shall continue to deal solely and
directly with the Lender in connection with the Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement.   The Lender selling a
participating interest to any Participant other than an Affiliate
or Related Fund of the Lender in any Loan, the Note, the
Commitment or other interest under this Agreement shall, within
10 Domestic Business Days of such sale, provide the Borrower with
written notification stating that such sale has occurred and
identifying the Participant and the interest purchased by such
Participant.

          (c)  The Lender may at any time assign to one or more commercial
banks, finance companies, insurance companies or other financial
institution or fund which, in each case, in the ordinary course
of business extends credit of the type contemplated herein and
whose becoming an assignee would not constitute a prohibited
transaction under Section 4975 of ERISA (each an "Assignee") all
or a proportionate part of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents, and such
Assignee shall assume all such rights and obligations, pursuant
to an Assignment and Acceptance, executed by such Assignee, the
Lender, subject to clause (iii) below, by the Borrower); provided
that (i) no interest may be sold by the Lender pursuant to this
paragraph (c) unless the Assignee shall agree to assume ratably
equivalent portions of the Commitment, (ii) if the Lender is
assigning only a portion of the Commitment, then, the amount of
the Commitment being assigned (determined as of the effective
date of the assignment) shall be in an amount not less than
$2,000,000 (except that there shall be no such minimum if the
assignment is to any Affiliate or Related Fund of the Lender),
and (iii) no interest may be sold by the Lender pursuant to this
paragraph (c) to any Assignee that is not an Affiliate or Related
Fund of the Lender without the consent of (unless a Default has
occurred and is continuing) the Borrower, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.  Upon (A) execution of the Assignment
and Acceptance by the Lender, such Assignee, and (if applicable)
the Borrower, (B) delivery of an executed copy of the Assignment
to the Borrower, and (C) payment by such Assignee to the Lender
of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between the
Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee shall for all purposes be
a Lender party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights
and obligations of the Lender under this Agreement to the same
extent as if it were an original party hereto with a Commitment
as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the Lender
shall be released from its obligations
<PAGE> 50

hereunder  to a corresponding extent, and no further  consent  or
action by the Borrower or the Lender shall be required.  Upon the
consummation  of  any transfer to an Assignee  pursuant  to  this
Section  11.08(c),  the  Lender  and  the  Borrower  shall   make
appropriate  arrangements so that, if required,  a  new  Note  is
issued to such Assignee.

          (d)  Subject to the provisions of this Section 11.08, the
Borrower  authorizes the Lender to disclose to  any  Participant,
Assignee  or  other  transferee (each  a  "Transferee")  and  any
prospective  Transferee  which  has  executed  a  confidentiality
agreement  any  and  all financial information  in  the  Lender's
possession  concerning the Borrower which has been  delivered  to
the  Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement  or  which
has  been  delivered to the Lender by the Borrower in  connection
with  the Lender's credit evaluation prior to entering into  this
Agreement.

          (e)  No Transferee shall be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 8.03 than the transferor Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred,
unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written
consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 9.02 or 9.03
requiring the Lender to designate a different Lending Office
under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances
giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

          (f)  Anything in this Section 11.08 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Lender may assign and pledge all or any
portion of the Loans and/or obligations owing to it to any
Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral
security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by
such Federal Reserve Bank, provided that any payment in respect
of such assigned Loans and/or obligations made by the Borrower to
the assigning and/or pledging Lender in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement shall satisfy the Borrower's obligations
hereunder in respect of such assigned Loans and/or obligations to
the extent of such payment.  No such assignment shall release the
assigning and/or pledging Lender from its obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 11.09  Confidentiality.

   The  Lender agrees to exercise the same standard of care that  it
exercises in the handling of its own confidential information  to
keep  any  information delivered or made available  by  the  Loan
Parties  to  it  which is clearly indicated  to  be  confidential
information, confidential from anyone other than persons employed
or  retained  by  the  Lender who are or are expected  to  become
engaged  in  evaluating, approving, structuring or  administering
the  Loans; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Lender
from  disclosing  such information (i) to  an  Affiliate  of  the
Lender,  but  subject  to  the same confidentiality  obligations,
(ii)  upon  the  order  of  any court or  administrative  agency,
(iii)  upon  the  request or demand of any regulatory  agency  or
authority  having jurisdiction over the Lender,  (iv)  which  has
been publicly disclosed, (v) to the extent reasonably required in
connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, (vi) to the
Lender's legal counsel and independent auditors, and (vii) to any
actual  or proposed Participant, Assignee or other Transferee  of
all  or  part  of  its  rights hereunder;  provided  that  should
disclosure  of any such confidential information be  required  by
virtue  of clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence,  to
the extent permitted by law, the Lender shall promptly notify the
Borrower of same so as to allow the Borrower to seek a protective
order or to take any other appropriate action; provided, further,
that, the Lender shall

<PAGE> 51

not  be  required  to  delay compliance  with  any  directive  to
disclose  any  such information so as to allow  the  Borrower  to
effect any such action.

     SECTION 11.10  Representation by Lender.

   The Lender hereby represents that it is a commercial lender or
financial institution which makes loans in the ordinary course of
its  business and that it will make its Loans hereunder  for  its
own  account  in  the ordinary course of such business;  provided
that, subject to Section 11.08, the disposition of the Note  held
by the Lender shall at all times be within its exclusive control.

     SECTION 11.11  Virginia Law.

   This  Agreement, the Note and all of the other Loan  Documents
shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law  of
the Commonwealth of Virginia.

     SECTION 11.12  Severability.

   In  case any one or more of the provisions contained  in  this
Agreement, the Note or any of the other Loan Documents should  be
invalid,  illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the  validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein  and therein shall not in any way be affected or  impaired
thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by
law.

     SECTION 11.13  Interest.

   In  no  event  shall the amount of interest, and all  charges,
amounts or fees contracted for, charged or collected pursuant  to
this  Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents and  deemed
to  be  interest under applicable law (collectively,  "Interest")
exceed  the  highest rate of interest allowed by  applicable  law
(the  "Maximum  Rate"),  and in the event  any  such  payment  is
inadvertently  received by the Lender, then the excess  sum  (the
"Excess") shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the
Borrower  shall notify the Lender in writing that  it  elects  to
have  the  Excess returned forthwith.  It is the  express  intent
hereof  that  the  Borrower not pay and the Lender  not  receive,
directly  or  indirectly  in any manner whatsoever,  interest  in
excess  of  that which may legally be paid by the Borrower  under
applicable law.  The right to accelerate maturity of any  of  the
Loans does not include the right to accelerate any interest  that
has  not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration,  and
the  Lender  does not intend to collect any unearned interest  in
the  event  of  any such acceleration.  All monies  paid  to  the
Lender  hereunder  or under any of the Note  or  the  other  Loan
Documents, whether at maturity or by prepayment, shall be subject
to  rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required  by
applicable law.  By the execution of this Agreement, the Borrower
covenants, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that  (i)  the
credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by
the Borrower of such Excess, and (ii) the Borrower shall not seek
or  pursue  any  other  remedy, legal or equitable,  against  the
Lender,  based in whole or in part upon contracting for  charging
or receiving any Interest in excess of the Maximum Rate.  For the
purpose  of  determining  whether or  not  any  Excess  has  been
contracted  for, charged or received by the Lender, all  interest
at any time contracted for, charged or received from the Borrower
in  connection with this Agreement, the Note or any of the  other
Loan  Documents shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
be  amortized,  prorated, allocated and  spread  in  equal  parts
throughout the full term of the Commitment.  The Borrower and the
Lender  shall,  to the maximum extent permitted under  applicable
law,  (i)  characterize any non-principal payment as an  expense,
fee or premium rather than as Interest and (ii) exclude voluntary
prepayments  and  the effects thereof.  The  provisions  of  this
Section shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Note and each
of the other Loan Documents (whether or not any provision of this
Section is

<PAGE> 52

referred to therein).  All such Loan Documents and communications
relating to any Interest owed by the Borrower and all figures set
forth therein shall, for the sole purpose of computing the extent
of  obligations hereunder and under the Note and the  other  Loan
Documents be automatically recomputed by the Borrower, and by any
court considering the same, to give effect to the adjustments  or
credits required by this Section.

     SECTION 11.14  Interpretation.

   No  provision  of  this Agreement or any  of  the  other  Loan
Documents  shall  be  construed against  or  interpreted  to  the
disadvantage  of  any  party  hereto  by  any  court   or   other
governmental or judicial authority by reason of such party having
or being deemed to have structured or dictated such provision.

     SECTION 11.15  Waiver of Jury Trial; Consent to Jurisdiction.

   The Loan Parties (a) and the Lender irrevocably waive, to  the
fullest  extent permitted by law, any and all right to  trial  by
jury  in any legal proceeding arising out of this Agreement,  any
of   the  other  Loan  Documents,  or  any  of  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby or thereby, (b) submit to  the  nonexclusive
personal jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Virginia, the courts
thereof  and  the United States District Courts sitting  therein,
for  the  enforcement of this Agreement, the Note and  the  other
Loan  Documents, (c) waive any and all personal rights under  the
law  of  any  jurisdiction  to object on  any  basis  (including,
without  limitation, inconvenience of forum) to  jurisdiction  or
venue  within  the Commonwealth of Virginia for  the  purpose  of
litigation to enforce this Agreement, the Note or the other  Loan
Documents, and (d) agree that service of process may be made upon
it  at  the address set forth in Section 11.01 for the giving  of
notice to the Borrower.  Nothing herein contained, however, shall
prevent  the  Lender from bringing any action or  exercising  any
rights  against any security and against the Borrower personally,
and against any assets of the Borrower, within any other state or
jurisdiction.

     SECTION 11.16  Counterparts.

   This  Agreement  may be signed in any number of  counterparts,
each  of which shall be an original, with the same effect  as  if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

     SECTION 11.17  Source of Funds -- ERISA.

   The  Lender hereby represents to the Borrower that no part  of
the  funds  to be used by the Lender to fund the Loans  hereunder
from  time  to  time  constitutes (i)  assets  allocated  to  any
separate  account maintained by the Lender in which any  employee
benefit plan (or its related trust) has any interest nor (ii) any
other  assets  of  any employee benefit plan.  As  used  in  this
Section, the terms "employee benefit plan" and "separate account"
shall  have  the respective meanings assigned to  such  terms  in
Section 3 of ERISA.

                    Fairfax County, Virginia

                        September 28, 2001

For value received, ATLANTIC COAST AIRLINES, a California
corporation (the "Borrower"), promises to pay to the order of
WACHOVIA BANK, N.A., a national banking association (the
"Lender"), for the account of its Lending Office, the principal
sum of TWENTY-FIVE MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($25,000,000), or
such lesser amount as shall equal the unpaid principal amount of
each Loan made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the Loan
and Security Agreement referred to below, on the dates and in the
amounts provided in the Loan and Security Agreement.  The
Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount
of this Note on the dates and at the rate or rates provided for
in the Loan and Security Agreement.  Interest on any overdue
principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest on the principal amount hereof shall bear interest at
the Default Rate, as provided for in the Loan and Security
Agreement. All such payments of principal and interest shall be
made in lawful money of the United States in Federal or other
immediately available funds at the office of Wachovia Bank, N.A.,
8270 Greensboro Drive, 4th Floor, McLean, Virginia 22102, or such
other address as may be specified from time to time pursuant to
the Loan and Security Agreement.

     All  Loans  made  by  the Lender, the respective  maturities
thereof, the interest rates from time to time applicable thereto,
and all repayments of the principal thereof shall be recorded  by
the  Lender  and, prior to any transfer hereof, endorsed  by  the
Lender  on the schedule attached hereto, or on a continuation  of
such  schedule attached to and made a part hereof; provided  that
the  failure  of  the  Lender to make  any  such  recordation  or
endorsement  shall  not affect the obligations  of  the  Borrower
hereunder or under the Loan and Security Agreement.

     This  Note is the Note referred to in the Loan and  Security
Agreement dated as of even date herewith between the Borrower and
the Lender (as the same may be amended and modified from time  to
time,  the "Loan and Security Agreement").  Terms defined in  the
Loan  and  Security  Agreement are  used  herein  with  the  same
meanings.   Reference is made to the Loan and Security  Agreement
for  provisions for the optional and mandatory prepayment and the
repayment hereof and the acceleration of the maturity hereof,  as
well  as  the  obligation of the Borrower to  pay  all  costs  of
collection,  including reasonable attorneys fees,  in  the  event
