</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet Systems, Inc. (&#147;AirNet&#148;) is a specialty air carrier for time-sensitive deliveries, operating
between most major United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;) cities each working day. AirNet is a leading transporter
of cancelled checks and related information for the U.S. banking industry. AirNet also provides
specialized, high-priority delivery services to customers, primarily those involved in medical
testing laboratories, radioactive pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, controlled sensitive media
and mission critical parts industries. During the first nine months of 2006, AirNet also provided
private passenger charter services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Jetride, Inc. (&#147;Jetride&#148;).
As described below, the Jetride passenger charter business was sold on September&nbsp;26, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to regularly scheduled delivery services through its air and ground transportation
network, AirNet offers on-demand cargo charter delivery services for both Bank Services and Express
Services customers. AirNet also provides ground pick-up and delivery services throughout the
nation seven days per week, primarily through a network of third-party vendors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s air and ground network provides highly reliable, time-critical delivery services to its
customers. Later pick-up and earlier delivery times than those offered by other national carriers
is one of the primary differentiating characteristics of AirNet&#146;s time-critical delivery network.
AirNet&#146;s flight schedule is designed to provide delivery times between midnight and 8:00 a.m.,
providing earlier delivery times than those generally available through other national carriers.
AirNet uses a number of proprietary customer service and management information systems to sort,
dispatch, track and control the flow of packages throughout AirNet&#146;s delivery system. AirNet
provides customer service 24 hours per day, seven days a week to assist customers with shipment
orders, inquiries, supply requests and proof of delivery documentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, AirNet operated a fleet of 102 aircraft (including 40 Beech Barons, 29
LearJets and 16 Cessna Caravan turboprops) that depart from over 95 cities and complete more than
340 flights per night, primarily Monday through Thursday night.&nbsp; Approximately 17% of AirNet&#146;s
weekday flights are subcontracted to third-party aircraft operators.&nbsp; To supplement its air
transportation network, AirNet uses commercial passenger airlines to provide additional services
when its aircraft are not operating and to provide service to markets that AirNet flights do not
serve.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet continues to consult with its banking customers to determine their future requirements for
air transportation services as they transition to image products and other electronic alternatives
to the physical movement of cancelled checks. As a result of past discussions, AirNet made
significant changes to its air transportation network to meet the evolving service needs of its
Bank Services customers. These changes, which became effective March&nbsp;26, 2007, resulted in the
elimination of 45 flights, or approximately 10%, of AirNet&#146;s weekday flight schedule. In addition,
in October&nbsp;2007, AirNet made further changes to its air transportation network to meet the needs of
its Bank Services customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;15, 2007, AirNet announced a new pricing structure for AirNet&#146;s weekday Bank Services
customers and notified them of the structure and of price increases effective at various times in
the future. The new pricing structure and price increase incorporate tiered zone pricing features
where the cities AirNet serves are categorized by current shipping volumes based on both origins
and destinations and a core zone support charge effective when dispatches are terminated. For
additional information on these flight and pricing changes, see the discussion under the caption
&#147;Bank Services Revenues&#148; in &#147;ITEM 7 &#150; MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#148; of Part&nbsp;II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of the development of a revised business strategy, AirNet is implementing growth plans
to expand dedicated scheduled and on demand cargo charter services for customers in niche markets
requiring high control, rapid delivery and non conforming delivery times. This plan involves
expanding charter services for existing customers, extending charter services to other customers
and market segments, and creating small specialized networks for specific customers. This cargo
charter business model involves flying an aircraft for a single customer under a customer defined
itinerary where the customer buys the entire aircraft&#146;s capacity. Additionally, AirNet intends to
grow by providing express feeder service through dedicated charters for the large integrated
carriers. This cargo charter model involves flying dedicated feeder charters where the cost
structure is predominately the Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance costs excluding fuel
(&#147;ACMI&#148;). AirNet believes that growth opportunities exist in the ACMI market because of large
integrated carriers&#146; desire to work with a smaller number of feeder companies, a shift in emphasis
from price to service reliability, and consolidation occurring within the airline sector in which
AirNet operates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet will operate a smaller national network as the bank business changes and may become an air
carrier that primarily serves charter customers in a scheduled and on demand environment. AirNet
will rely on its customer service focus and its operating strengths as an airline operator, pilot
recruiter and trainer, and aircraft maintenance provider to make the transition. AirNet expects to
implement cost reductions in its administration, ground and air network operations coinciding with
adjustments to the changing Bank Services and Express Services business conditions. AirNet will
also evaluate and adjust

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">Bank Services, primarily consisting of cancelled check delivery, generated approximately 62%
and 65% of AirNet&#146;s total net revenues for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. AirNet&#146;s time-critical cancelled check delivery service allows its
banking customers to reduce their float costs and related processing fees. AirNet also
transports other items, such as proof of deposit transactions and interoffice mail, for many
of the same bank customers. The U.S. banking industry, including commercial banks and
third-party processors, represents AirNet&#146;s largest category of customers. AirNet&#146;s bank
customers represent many of the nation&#146;s largest bank holding companies. For 2007 and 2006,
AirNet had five Bank Services customers that aggregated approximately 39% and 40% of total
net revenues, respectively. One Bank Services customer comprised approximately 11% of total
net revenues in 2007 while two Bank Services customers comprised 11% and 10% of total net
revenues in 2006.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">AirNet has received additional service cancellations from its banking customers which become
effective in the first and second quarters of 2008. These service cancellations represented
approximately $9.3&nbsp;million of revenues on an annual basis in 2007, including approximately
$1.5&nbsp;million of fuel surcharge revenues. AirNet expects additional cancellations at an
accelerating rate from its banking customers in 2008 and thereafter.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">Express Services, which focus on customers with time-critical delivery needs, generated
approximately 36% and 34% of AirNet&#146;s total net revenues for the fiscal years ended December
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition to regularly scheduled delivery services
through its air and ground transportation network, AirNet offers on-demand cargo charter
delivery services for Express Services customers. AirNet also provides ground pick-up and
delivery services throughout the nation seven days per week, primarily through a network of
third-party vendors. Express Services are primarily targeted at customers involved in
medical testing laboratories, radioactive pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, controlled
sensitive media and mission critical parts and other customers whose shipment needs are
highly time sensitive, time-definite or highly controlled. In the life sciences industry,
Express Services are offered to customers shipping packages that require specialized
handling, the transportation of which is often highly regulated by various governmental
authorities. Targeted markets within the medical testing laboratories industry include
producers and recipients of diagnostic specimens, blood, umbilical cord blood, human tissue
and organs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">For those customers requiring time-critical delivery options not available on AirNet&#146;s
regularly scheduled routes, cargo charter services are available. Cargo charter services may
be regularly scheduled or scheduled on an on-demand, as-needed basis, 24 hours per day, seven
days a week.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of March&nbsp;31, 2008, AirNet entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by an
affiliate of Bayside Capital, Inc. (&#147;Bayside Capital&#148;) for $2.81 per share in a cash merger
transaction. The price represents a premium of approximately 94% over the closing price of $1.45
per share on March&nbsp;28, 2008. The total value of the transaction in the merger is approximately
$28.7&nbsp;million (before transaction costs). In conjunction with the merger agreement, the affiliate of Bayside Capital will
also be purchasing approximately 1.9 million common shares of AirNet at $2.81 for a total purchase price of
approximately $5.4 million.

will vote on the proposed merger at a special meeting that will be held on a date to be announced.
Completion of the merger is subject to various customary closing conditions, including
shareholder approval and adoption of the merger and the merger agreement and the obtaining of any
required regulatory approvals. The closing of the merger is expected to occur during the second
quarter of 2008, and is not subject to any financing contingencies. However, there can be no
assurances that the parties will be able to obtain any required regulatory approvals of the merger
on the proposed terms and schedule, that AirNet&#146;s shareholders will approve and adopt the merger
and the merger agreement or that the other closing conditions will be satisfied. Additionally,
uncertainty surrounding the proposed merger may make it more difficult to maintain relationships
with AirNet&#146;s customers and team members. In the event that the merger is not consummated,
AirNet&#146;s management and Board of Directors would re-assess the options available to AirNet and may
revise AirNet&#146;s strategic direction, as necessary.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Sale of Jetride&#146;s Passenger Charter Business</B>

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;26, 2006, AirNet, Jetride, and Pinnacle Air, LLC (&#147;Pinnacle&#148;) entered into a purchase
agreement regarding the sale of Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business to Pinnacle. The sale was
completed on September&nbsp;26, 2006. The purchase price was $41.0&nbsp;million in cash, of which $40.0
million was consideration for the sale of nine company-owned aircraft and related engine
maintenance programs and $1.0&nbsp;million was consideration for the sale of all of the outstanding
capital stock of a newly-created subsidiary of Jetride, also called Jetride, Inc. (&#147;New Jetride&#148;).
Of the total consideration, $40.0&nbsp;million was paid at closing and $1.0&nbsp;million was paid into escrow
to cover potential indemnification claims made by Pinnacle. Since no indemnification claims were
made, the escrow amount was released to AirNet in two installments of $500,000 each in March&nbsp;2007
and August&nbsp;2007. AirNet retained the net working capital of the Jetride passenger charter
business, which was approximately $2.2&nbsp;million as of the closing date. In connection with the
closing of the sale transaction, Jetride repaid in full six term loans which had been secured by
aircraft used in Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business. The aggregate principal amount of the loans
repaid was approximately $28.2&nbsp;million plus accrued interest and early termination prepayment
penalties of approximately $0.3&nbsp;million through the repayment date. Following repayment of
Jetride&#146;s loans and expenses related to the transaction, AirNet used the remaining sale proceeds to
further reduce debt outstanding under AirNet&#146;s secured revolving credit facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the transaction, AirNet agreed to provide certain transition services to
Pinnacle and its subsidiaries for various specified time periods and various monthly fees, which
initially aggregated to approximately $37,500 per month, primarily for aircraft maintenance
services. Effective March&nbsp;25, 2007, Pinnacle and AirNet extended the term of various transition
services provided by AirNet to Pinnacle on a month to month basis. AirNet and Pinnacle also agreed
to reduce the monthly fees for such transition services to $36,250 per month. In addition, in
September&nbsp;2006, AirNet entered into three subleases with New Jetride, under which New Jetride
leased a portion of AirNet&#146;s facilities located at the Rickenbacker Facility, Dallas Love Field and
Birmingham International Airport. The aggregate monthly lease payment under the three subleases
was approximately $10,000. Pinnacle terminated its subleases of AirNet&#146;s facilities located at
Birmingham International Airport and Dallas Love Field effective April&nbsp;30, 2007 and June&nbsp;30, 2007,
respectively. Pinnacle terminated its agreement for certain transition services and its sublease
of AirNet&#146;s Rickenbacker Facility effective September&nbsp;17, 2007 and October&nbsp;12, 2007, respectively.

Passenger Charter Services as assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations and

only one reportable segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from Passenger Charter Services, included in discontinued operations, were approximately
$16.9&nbsp;million for 2006. Income from discontinued operations before income taxes for 2006 was
approximately $0.1&nbsp;million. Included in the 2006 income from discontinued operations before income
taxes is a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, which is net of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million
of investment banking and legal fees associated with the sale of Jetride.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet plans to continue providing transportation services to the banking industry, but expects
that its Bank Services revenues will continue to decline at an accelerating rate in future periods
as a result of the increasing use by Bank Services customers of image products and other electronic
alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks. On October&nbsp;15, 2007, AirNet issued a
press release announcing a new pricing structure for AirNet&#146;s weekday Bank Services customers and
notified them of the structure and of price increases effective at various times in the future.
The new pricing structure and price increase incorporate tiered zone pricing features where the
cities AirNet serves are categorized by current shipping volumes based on both origins and
destinations and a core zone support charge effective when dispatches are terminated. AirNet will
continue to evaluate and adjust its network fleet operation and size in response to changing
business conditions and the needs of its Bank Services and Express Services customers. AirNet
continues to work with individual Bank Services customers to understand their future transportation
requirements and to restructure contractual relationships. In addition, AirNet will review its
ground operations for efficiencies and cost reductions as AirNet reduces its air transportation
network.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The continuing decline in AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues will require additional significant
changes in AirNet&#146;s air transportation network, including further reductions in its airline route
schedule, the number of aircraft it operates, operating and administrative costs and may cause Bank
Services customers to make additional cancellations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed in the section captioned &#147;Business Strategy&#148; in &#147;ITEM 1 &#150; BUSINESS&#148; of Part
I of AirNet&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet&#146;s
business strategy had been focused on increasing Express Services revenues in 2007 and subsequent
years. AirNet&#146;s intent had been to increase its focus on Express Services customers in
time-critical, time-definite, and high control delivery markets. However, AirNet&#146;s Express
Services revenues and contribution margin are not sufficient to offset the accelerating decline in
weekday and weekend Bank Services revenues and contribution margin. As a result, further
substantial reductions in AirNet&#146;s weekday air transportation network will be required at various
times in the future. Given the inherent high fixed costs of operating AirNet&#146;s air transportation
network, AirNet believes that it will be difficult to reduce operating costs in proportion to
anticipated declines in Bank Services revenues. Additional reductions in AirNet&#146;s air
transportation network will also result in the elimination of certain delivery services to AirNet&#146;s
Bank Services and Express Services customers, resulting in additional declines in revenues. Under
the existing business model, AirNet would expect that the continuing decline in Bank Services
revenues, combined with the high fixed costs of operating its air transportation network, would
result in a significant decline in AirNet&#146;s profitability and may result in operating losses in
future periods. In response to this fact, AirNet has been developing a new business strategy that
focuses on the core strengths of AirNet&#146;s flight operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the development of this new business strategy, AirNet retained a third party
consulting firm/investment bank, MergeGlobal, Inc., to assist AirNet in evaluating strategic
alternatives to mitigate the decline in Bank Services revenues. Among the alternatives being
considered are cost reductions, expansion of charter flying, entry into new transportation markets,
sale of part of AirNet&#146;s assets, and other strategic initiatives, including acquisitions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of the evaluation, AirNet is implementing growth plans to expand dedicated scheduled
and on demand cargo charter services for customers in niche markets requiring high control, rapid
delivery and non conforming delivery times. This plan involves expanding charter services for
existing customers, extending charter services to other customers and market segments, and creating
small specialized networks for specific customers. This cargo charter business model involves
flying an aircraft for a single customer under a customer defined itinerary where the customer buys
the entire aircraft&#146;s capacity. AirNet&#146;s current customers for these services include medical
testing laboratories, radioactive pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, controlled sensitive media
firms and other companies that have mission critical operations. Additionally, AirNet intends to
grow by providing express feeder service through dedicated charters for the large integrated
carriers. This cargo charter model involves flying dedicated feeder charters where the cost
structure is predominately ACMI. The feeder ACMI market is a market within a competitive contract
cargo carrier market, and primarily includes express feeder service to the large integrated
carriers such as United Parcel Service (&#147;UPS&#148;), DHL, Purolator and Federal Express Corporation
(&#147;FedEx&#148;). This ACMI market is highly fragmented with many small operators. AirNet believes that
growth opportunities exist in the ACMI market because of large integrated carriers&#146; desire to work
with a smaller number of feeder companies, a shift in emphasis from price to service reliability,
and consolidation occurring within the airline sector in which AirNet operates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet will operate a smaller national network as the bank business changes and may become an air
carrier that primarily serves charter customers in a scheduled and on demand environment. AirNet
will rely on its customer service focus and its operating strengths as an airline operator, pilot
recruiter and trainer, and aircraft maintenance provider to make the transition. AirNet expects to
implement cost reductions in its administration, ground and air network operations coinciding with
adjustments to the changing Bank Services and Express Services business conditions. AirNet will
also evaluate and adjust its current fleet of aircraft types to support ACMI and dedicated cargo
charter service requirements. AirNet expects to make additional changes in its aircraft fleet over
time both in terms of reductions or additions of aircraft and aircraft types.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There can be no assurance that AirNet can make a transition to an air carrier primarily serving
ACMI and dedicated cargo charter customers, that related alternatives or cost reductions can be
implemented or, if fully implemented, the transition to ACMI or dedicated cargo charter markets,
together with such alternatives or cost reductions, will be sufficient to counter the trend of
declining Bank Services revenues and profitability in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2006, AirNet decided to market for sale all nine of the Cessna 310 Piston cargo
aircraft as a result of the need to reduce its airline capacity and operating costs. In November
2006, AirNet entered into an agreement to sell these aircraft for approximately $0.5&nbsp;million.
AirNet delivered seven aircraft in the first quarter of 2007 and delivered the two remaining
aircraft in June&nbsp;2007.

training program includes flight simulator training prior to any actual flight time in an AirNet
aircraft, as well as intensive ground instruction. Additionally, new pilots gain operating
experience in a structured setting prior to assignment in order to gain a familiarity with AirNet&#146;s
route system and the unique demands of the flight environment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s central dispatch system coordinates all components of the air cargo operation. Departure
and arrival times are continuously updated, and weather conditions throughout the nation are
monitored. AirNet air operations personnel remain in contact with pilots, out-based hub managers,
fuelers, maintenance technicians and ground delivery personnel to identify and minimize any
potential delays in the delivery process.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Capacity management is an important factor in maintaining profitability of AirNet&#146;s package
delivery services. AirNet&#146;s air transportation network is positioned around a flexible national
route structure designed to facilitate late pick-up and early delivery times, minimize delays and
simplify flight scheduling. AirNet&#146;s flexible route structure allows it to respond to the changing
volume needs of its customers. AirNet&#146;s primary hub in Columbus, Ohio, and several mini-hubs
across the nation, are located primarily in less congested regional airports. These locations, in
conjunction with AirNet&#146;s off-peak departure and arrival times, provide easy take-off and landings,
convenient loading and unloading and fast refueling and maintenance. AirNet also uses commercial
passenger airlines, primarily to transport shipments during the daytime and weekend hours when its
aircraft are operating under a limited flight schedule.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet employs approximately 80 aircraft and avionics technicians in seven separate locations
across the U.S. who perform maintenance on AirNet&#146;s fleet of aircraft. AirNet has an in-house
engine shop at the Rickenbacker Facility where some of the piston engines are overhauled on-site,
thereby reducing aircraft downtime and controlling costs. AirNet also performs avionics
troubleshooting and repair at its Rickenbacker Facility to provide for maximum efficiency and
minimum aircraft downtime for the fleet. AirNet&#146;s aircraft maintenance center at its Columbus hub
has received ISO 9001:2000 certification and holds a repair station certificate granted by the FAA.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Bank shipments are pre-sorted by bank customer personnel and packaged in AirNet-supplied bags with
three letter city identifier tags to show final destination. Express shipments are packaged in
either AirNet-provided packaging or the customers&#146; packaging. Shipments transported on AirNet&#146;s
air transportation network are typically picked up by a courier and transported to the local
airport where an airbill is either scanned using bar code technology or entered manually.
Information on each airbill pertaining to the shipper, receiver, airbill number and applicable
deadline is captured and downloaded into AirNet&#146;s computer system, where it is available to
AirNet&#146;s customer service representatives (&#147;CSRs&#148;). Upon arrival at AirNet&#146;s Columbus hub or one
of its mini-hubs, the shipment is off-loaded, sorted by destination and reloaded onto an aircraft.
At the final destination city, the shipment is off-loaded and delivered by courier to the receiver.
When delivered, information from the airbill is once again captured and downloaded into AirNet&#146;s
computer system. Delivery information for all shipments is then available on-line to customers and
AirNet&#146;s CSRs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For banking customers meeting daytime banking deadlines and Express customers requiring
next-flight-out timing, shipments are typically picked up by a courier and transported via
commercial airlines or other integrators to destination cities where couriers recover the packages
and deliver them to their final destinations.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet manages its ground delivery services primarily through a network of vendor couriers. The
use of vendor couriers to perform the majority of ground delivery services, allows AirNet to better
match its ground costs with its volume requirements. In limited situations, employees are used for
ground delivery services on scheduled routes where volume requirements economically justify
employing full-time couriers or customers&#146; needs require employee couriers. Dispatching functions
related to ground delivery services occur at AirNet&#146;s Columbus, Ohio hub and on a regional basis in
some of the major cities served.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Regulations. The FAA&#146;s regulatory
authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft
standards and maintenance, personnel, and ground facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The U. S. Department of Transportation (&#147;DOT&#148;) and Transportation Security Administration (&#147;TSA&#148;)
have regulatory authority concerning operational and security concerns in transportation, including
aviation safety, security, insurance and hazardous materials. AirNet holds various operational
certificates issued by these and other governmental agencies, including grantee status to DOT-SP
7060 Special Permit and a Transport Canada Permit SA &#150; 8818 for Equivalent Level of
Safety, which permit AirNet to transport higher volumes of time-critical radioactive
pharmaceuticals than is allowed by the DOT and Transport Canada for most carriers. AirNet&#146;s
grantee status under the DOT-SP 7060 Special Permit expires in August&nbsp;2010 and its Permit for
Equivalent Level of Safety expires in March&nbsp;2010. These permits may be renewed at such times.
AirNet is also subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the
transportation of pharmaceuticals and live animals, as well as by various state and local
authorities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet believes that it has all permits, approvals and licenses required to conduct its operations
and that it is in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to its operations,
including all applicable noise level regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet transports packages on both its airline and on commercial airlines. The TSA requires that
AirNet maintain certain security programs related to its operations, including a Twelve-Five
Standard Security Program (&#147;TFSSP&#148;) and an Indirect Air Carrier Standard Security Program
(&#147;IACSSP&#148;). The TFSSP governs security procedures applicable to AirNet&#146;s airline and the IACSSP
governs security procedures for tendering packages to commercial airlines. AirNet Systems Inc.
maintains the TSA approved TFSSP. AirNet Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AirNet
(&#147;AirNet Management&#148;), maintains the TSA approved IACSSP. AirNet Systems and AirNet Management
believe that they are in compliance with all the requirements of the TFSSP and IACSSP programs that
they maintain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of increased concerns regarding airline security, in May&nbsp;2006 the TSA adopted new rules
and regulations&nbsp;to enhance the security requirements relating to the transportation of cargo on
both passenger and all-cargo aircraft. These new rules, when fully implemented, will require air
carriers maintaining TFSSP and IACSSP programs to institute new or additional security measures,
including enhanced training of personnel responsible for maintaining such programs or involved in
the processing of air cargo, more extensive background checks of such personnel, and new rules for
verifying the identity of shippers and individuals tendering packages to commercial airlines.
AirNet has implemented the new TSA rules and regulations that are currently in effect and intends
to implement other security measures as they become effective.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On
January&nbsp;9, 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed bill H.R.1 entitled
&#147;Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007&#148; and the bill was received in the
U.S. Senate and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
On March&nbsp;5, 2007, the Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation of the U.S. Senate
reported bill S.509 entitled &#147;Aviation Security Improvement Act&#148; with amendments and the bill as
amended was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar. If enacted, each of these bills would
provide for significant further regulation and inspection/screening of cargo transported on
commercial passenger airlines. If these bills are enacted, commercial passenger airlines may
require earlier tendering times which may impact AirNet&#146;s ability to meet current shipping
timeframes for its customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On February&nbsp;14, 2007, the FAA submitted its reauthorization funding proposal to Congress entitled
<I>&#147;The Next Generation Air Transportation System Financing Reform Act of 2007&#148;</I>. The FAA proposal, if
enacted, would significantly change the way the federal government funds the FAA. The FAA proposal
would shift a significant portion of the FAA&#146;s funding from general tax receipts to a fee based
funding system. The FAA proposal, if enacted, would also increase the federal tax on aviation
fuel. Neither the U.S. Senate nor the House of Representatives adopted all of the FAA&#146;s funding
recommendations contained in the <I>&#147;The Next Generation Air Transportation System Financing Reform
Act of 2007&#148;</I>. The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have proposed alternative FAA funding
legislation entitled, respectively, the <I>&#147;Aviation Investment and Modernization Act of 2007&#148; </I>and the
<I>&#147;FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007&#148;</I>. The U.S. Senate&#146;s initial proposed FAA funding legislation
included a proposed $25 per landing surcharge. The financial impact of any FAA funding legislation
on AirNet is dependent on the version of the legislation that is ultimately enacted into law.
AirNet will closely monitor the pending legislation to determine the financial impact on its costs
of operation.

commercial passenger airlines and requires all cargo placed on commercial passenger airlines after
August&nbsp;3, 2010 to be screened 100% for threats to commercial aviation safety and security. When
implemented, the heightened inspection and screening measures required under the Act may
necessitate earlier tendering times for cargo transported on commercial passenger airlines, which
may impact AirNet&#146;s ability to meet current shipping timeframes for its customers.

OPERATIONS&#148; under the heading &#147;Seasonality and Variability in Quarterly Results&#148; of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the seasonal aspects of AirNet&#146;s business, which discussion
is incorporated herein by reference.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The air and ground courier industry is highly competitive. AirNet&#146;s primary competitor in the
transportation of cancelled checks is the Federal Reserve&#146;s Check Relay Network (the &#147;CRN&#148;). The
actions of the Federal Reserve are regulated by the Monetary Control Act, which requires the
Federal Reserve to price its services at actual cost plus a set percentage private sector
adjustment factor. AirNet believes that the purpose of the Monetary Control Act is to curtail the
possibility of predatory pricing by the Federal Reserve when it competes with the private sector.
No assurance beyond the remedies of law can be given that the Federal Reserve will comply with the
Monetary Control Act. On February&nbsp;13, 2007, the Federal Reserve announced that on May&nbsp;21, 2007 it
would be significantly reducing the number of interdistrict flights on its CRN as a result of a
significant decline in the volume of cancelled checks to be transported. The Federal Reserve also
announced that it expects the CRN will be discontinued by 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the private sector, there are a large number of smaller, regional carriers that transport
cancelled checks, none of which AirNet believes has a significant interstate market share. The two
largest private sector national air carriers, FedEx and UPS, both carry cancelled checks where the
required deadlines fit into their existing system. AirNet does not believe that FedEx or UPS
represents a significant competitor in the time-critical cancelled check market. AirNet provides
customized service for its customer base, often with later pick-ups and earlier deliveries than the
large, national air carriers provide.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet currently operates extensive dedicated cargo charter flights for both Bank Services and
Express Services customers. Expansion of dedicated cargo charter flights encompasses extending
services for existing customers, expanding charter services to new market segments, and creating
small networks for specific customers. The ACMI market is a niche market within a highly
competitive contract cargo carrier market, and primarily includes express feeder service to large
integrated carriers such as UPS and FedEx. Additionally, the ACMI market is highly fragmented with
many small operators. AirNet believes that growth opportunities exist in the ACMI market because
of large integrated carriers&#146; desire to work with a smaller number of feeder companies, a shift in
emphasis from price to service reliability, and consolidation occurring within the Part&nbsp;135 airline
industry, in which AirNet operates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet competes with commercial passenger airlines and numerous other carriers in its Express
Services delivery business and estimates its market share in this industry at less than 1%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet believes that its national air transportation network, proprietary information technology
and historically high on-time performance level allow it to compete in the ACMI and dedicated cargo
charter markets. In recent years, additional charter aircraft competitors have received grantee
status to the DOT-SP 7060 Special Permit which has increased competition for radioactive
pharmaceuticals customers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Environmental matters</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2004, AirNet commenced construction of a new corporate and operational facility (the
&#147;Rickenbacker Facility&#148;) on land leased from the Columbus Regional Airport Authority (the
&#147;Authority&#148;). Construction of the Rickenbacker Facility was completed in May of 2005 and AirNet
completed the relocation of its flight and administrative operations to the Rickenbacker Facility
in June of 2005. Portions of the leased land on which the Rickenbacker Facility was constructed,
as well as portions of the aircraft ramp used by AirNet at the Rickenbacker Facility, contain known
pollution conditions. The appropriate amended post closure plan and no further action letters
addressing the Rickenbacker Facility and the aircraft ramp were obtained by AirNet from the
Authority prior to beginning construction. No additional pollution conditions on the leased land
were noted during construction of the Rickenbacker Facility or the aircraft ramp and none have been
noted through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2005, AirNet relocated its corporate and operational headquarters from 3939 International
Gateway in Columbus, Ohio (the &#147;Port Columbus Facility&#148;) to the new Rickenbacker Facility.
AirNet&#146;s lease of its Port Columbus Facility expired on August&nbsp;31, 2005. In connection with
vacating its Port Columbus Facility, AirNet was required to conduct an environmental assessment of
the Port Columbus Facility. The results of the environmental assessment demonstrated
concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons and vinyl chloride above the regulatory limits in samples
associated with one of three oil-water separators located in the hanger portion of the Port
Columbus Facility. Except for the area associated with the one oil-water separator, it was the
opinion of the environmental testing firm engaged to conduct the assessment that no obviously
recognized environmental conditions existed at AirNet&#146;s Port Columbus Facility in the areas
assessed, including the fuel farm which AirNet maintained at the Port Columbus Facility through
August&nbsp;2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Following completion of the environmental assessment of the Port Columbus Facility, AirNet, with
the assistance of the Authority, determined what actions were necessary to remediate the identified
pollution conditions. In March of 2006, AirNet completed remedial work to remove the pollution
conditions, which consisted primarily of the removal and replacement of a portion of the concrete
floor in the hangar area of the Port Columbus Facility, the removal and replacement of the
contaminated soil, and the installation of a new oil-water separator. Environmental testing
conducted upon the completion of the remedial work demonstrated no presence of petroleum
hydrocarbons or vinyl chloride above the regulatory limits in the area associated with the remedial
work.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet also maintained certain assets at Port Columbus for dispensing aviation fuel under the terms
and conditions of a separate lease agreement (the &#147;Fuel Farm Lease&#148;). The Fuel Farm Lease required
AirNet to return the premises leased under the Fuel Farm Lease to their original condition upon the
termination of the lease. In lieu of returning the premises to their original condition, the Fuel
Farm Lease provided that the Authority could take title to any improvements constructed by AirNet
on the leased premises. On August&nbsp;17, 2006, AirNet conveyed all of its fuel farm assets to the
Authority for $1 and a release of any future liabilities associated with the Fuel Farm Lease and
the fuel farm assets, other than any liabilities related to environmental conditions which may be
imposed by any governmental agency. The Fuel Farm Lease also was terminated on August&nbsp;17, 2006.
As a result of the conveyance of the fuel farm assets to the Authority and the termination of the
Fuel Farm Lease, AirNet was relieved of its obligation to return the leased premises to their
original condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of March&nbsp;31, 2008, AirNet entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by an
affiliate of Bayside Capital, Inc. (&#147;Bayside Capital&#148;) for $2.81 per share in a cash merger
transaction. The price represents a premium of approximately 94% over the closing price of $1.45
per share on March&nbsp;28, 2008. The total value of the transaction in the merger is approximately
$28.7&nbsp;million (before transaction costs). In conjunction with the merger agreement, the affiliate of Bayside Capital will
also be purchasing approximately 1.9 million common shares of AirNet at $2.81 for a total purchase price of
approximately $5.4 million.

adoption of the merger and the merger agreement by AirNet&#146;s shareholders. AirNet&#146;s shareholders
will vote on the proposed merger at a special meeting that will be held on a date to be announced.
Completion of the merger is subject to various customary closing conditions, including shareholder
approval and adoption of the merger and the merger agreement and the obtaining of any required
regulatory approvals. The closing of the merger is expected to occur during the second quarter of
2008, and is not subject to any financing contingencies. However, there can be no assurances that
the parties will be able to obtain any required regulatory approvals of the merger on the proposed
terms and schedule, that AirNet&#146;s shareholders will approve and adopt the merger and the merger
agreement or that the other closing conditions will be satisfied. Additionally, uncertainty
surrounding the proposed merger may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with AirNet&#146;s
customers and team members. In the event that the merger is not consummated, AirNet&#146;s management

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Check 21 Act, which became effective in October&nbsp;2004, created a new negotiable instrument
called a substitute check (also known as an image replacement document or &#147;IRD&#148;) that becomes the
legal equivalent of the original item. The Check 21 Act effectively removed the requirement of
returning an original paper check to the account holder&#146;s financial institution and required that
all financial institutions accept an IRD in lieu of a cancelled check. The Check 21 Act and the
transition in the banking industry to electronic methods of clearing cancelled checks will
eventually replace the need for expedited air transportation services for the delivery of original
cancelled checks by most of AirNet&#146;s banking customers. The Check 21 Act and electronic methods of
clearing cancelled checks have had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse affect on
AirNet&#146;s revenues derived from check delivery services.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The use of IRD&#146;s and other electronic methods to clear cancelled checks is accelerating and AirNet
is experiencing significant declines in the volume of cancelled checks it delivers for its banking
customers. The acceleration in the use of electronic methods of clearing checks has had and will
continue to have a significant adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s revenues and income. AirNet&#146;s
contribution margin on the delivery of cancelled checks is significantly higher than its
contribution margin from its other delivery services. The decline in revenues derived from check
delivery services and the associated loss of contribution margin will require AirNet to further
reduce its current route structure, the number of aircraft it operates and operating and
administrative costs. Such reductions in AirNet&#146;s national airline network will result in the
elimination of certain delivery services to its banking customers and will result in additional
declines in AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues. The high fixed costs of AirNet&#146;s national airline
structure make it difficult to reduce costs in proportion to anticipated decreases in revenues and
income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>AirNet has implemented a new pricing structure for its weekday Bank Services customers. If AirNet

revenues will adversely affect AirNet&#146;s operations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;15, 2007, AirNet issued a press release announcing a new pricing structure for AirNet&#146;s
weekday Bank Services customers and notified them of the structure and of price increases effective
at various times in the future. The new pricing structure and price increase incorporate tiered
zone pricing features where the cities AirNet serves are categorized by current shipping volumes
based on both origins and destinations and a core zone support charge effective when dispatches are
terminated. If AirNet is unable to successfully implement and hold the new pricing structure, the
continuing decline in AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues will require additional significant changes
in AirNet&#146;s air transportation network, including further reductions in its airline route schedule,
the number of aircraft it operates, operating and administrative costs and may cause Bank Services
customers to make additional cancellations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>AirNet will not be able to offset the accelerating decline in weekday and weekend Bank Services
revenues and contribution margins with Express Services revenues and contribution margins, which
could adversely affect AirNet&#146;s profitability and require further reductions in AirNet&#146;s weekday
air transportation network.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because the density of cancelled check shipments is greater than the typical Express Services
shipment, contribution margins on Bank Services shipments are substantially higher than Express
Services shipments after considering the cubic dimension of shipments. Also, due to the
unscheduled nature of Express Services shipments, pick-up and delivery costs per shipment are
higher for Express Services shipments than Bank Services shipments. Express Services contribution
margins are currently insufficient to support the operation of AirNet&#146;s airline as presently
configured. As AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues continue to decline due to service cancellations
driven by a decline in cancelled check volumes, it will be necessary for AirNet to continue to
restructure AirNet&#146;s airline by reducing routes and the number of aircraft its operates. Due to
the high fixed costs of operating AirNet&#146;s national air transportation network, there can be no
assurances that AirNet&#146;s financial performance in future periods will be profitable or sufficient
to support a national air transportation network.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Reductions in AirNet&#146;s route schedule and the number of aircraft it operates may adversely impact
AirNet&#146;s Express Services business.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s air and ground network that provides later pick-up and earlier delivery times than those
offered by other national carriers is one of the primary differentiating characteristics of
AirNet&#146;s time-critical delivery network. A significant portion of AirNet&#146;s Express Services
shipments are transported on AirNet&#146;s airline. The anticipated decline in AirNet&#146;s transportation
of cancelled checks has and will continue to require significant changes in AirNet&#146;s air
transportation network, including further reductions in its current route schedule and the number
of aircraft it operates. Reductions in AirNet&#146;s route schedule and the number of aircraft it
operates will require AirNet to transport a greater portion of its Express Services shipments on
commercial airlines and may result in the elimination of certain delivery services to AirNet&#146;s
Express Services customers, resulting in additional declines in revenues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>If AirNet fails to implement its revised business strategy successfully, AirNet&#146;s business may
suffer.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet has been developing a new business strategy that focuses on the core strengths of AirNet&#146;s
flight operations. AirNet has evaluated strategic alternatives to mitigate the decline in Bank
Services revenues, including cost reductions, expansion of charter flying, entry into new
transportation markets, sale of part of AirNet&#146;s assets, and other strategic initiatives, including
acquisitions. As a result of the development of a revised business strategy, AirNet is
implementing growth plans to expand dedicated scheduled and on demand cargo charter services for
customers in niche markets requiring high control, rapid delivery and non conforming delivery
times.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This plan involves expanding charter services for existing customers, extending charter services to
other customers and market segments, and creating small specialized networks for specific
customers. This cargo charter business model
involves flying an aircraft for a single customer under a customer defined itinerary where the
customer buys the entire aircraft&#146;s capacity. Additionally, AirNet intends to grow by providing
express feeder service through dedicated charters for the large integrated carriers. This cargo
charter model involves flying dedicated feeder charters where the cost structure is predominately
ACMI. AirNet will operate a smaller national network as the bank business changes and may become
an air carrier that primarily serves charter customers in a scheduled and on demand environment.
There can be no assurance that AirNet can make a transition to an air carrier primarily serving
ACMI and dedicated cargo charter customers, that related alternatives or cost reductions can be
implemented or, if fully implemented, the transition to ACMI or dedicated cargo charter markets,
together with such alternatives or cost reductions, will be sufficient to counter the trend of
declining Bank Services revenues and profitability in future periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition from other providers of express air and ground delivery services may adversely affect
AirNet&#146;s results of operations and financial condition.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s Bank Services compete primarily against the Federal Reserve&#146;s Check Relay Network, which
has significantly greater financial and other resources than AirNet. The Federal Reserve is
regulated by the Monetary Control Act of 1980, which in general requires that the Federal Reserve
price its services on an actual cost basis plus a set percentage private sector market adjustment
factor. Failure by the Federal Reserve to comply with the Monetary Control Act by pricing its
services below the required rates could have an adverse competitive impact on AirNet. On February
13, 2007, the Federal Reserve announced that on May&nbsp;21, 2007, it would be significantly reducing
the number of interdistrict flights on its CRN as a result of the significant decline in the volume
of cancelled checks to be transported. The Federal Reserve also announced that it expects the CRN
will be discontinued by 2010. Also, the market for Express Services is highly competitive.
Aggressive competition for customers with express delivery needs could have a material adverse
affect on revenue and contribution margins in Express Services. Additionally, the ACMI market is a
niche market within a highly competitive contract cargo carrier market, and primarily includes
express feeder service to large integrated carriers such as UPS and FedEx. AirNet believes that
growth opportunities exist in the ACMI market because of large integrated carriers&#146; desire to work
with a smaller number of feeder companies, a shift in emphasis from price to service reliability,
and consolidation occurring within the airline sector in which AirNet operates. There can be no
assurance, however, that AirNet can successfully compete as an air carrier primarily serving ACMI
and dedicated cargo charter customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>An economic downturn could result in less demand for AirNet&#146;s delivery services.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Many economists have reported that the U.S. economy is slowing, and may be headed toward a
recession. AirNet&#146;s air transportation network relies on customers who need time-sensitive
delivery services. AirNet&#146;s time-critical cancelled check delivery service allows its banking
customers to reduce their float costs and related processing fees. To the extent these costs and
fees become less significant to the overall operations of AirNet&#146;s banking customers, their demand
for AirNet&#146;s services may lessen. Additionally, since shipments are made by most of AirNet&#146;s
Express Services customers on an as-needed basis, AirNet does not have commitments from these
customers. The overall demand for both Bank Services and Express Services is primarily influenced
by the health of the U.S. economy, which is cyclical in nature, the seasonality and economic
health of the industries using AirNet&#146;s air transportation network and the availability,
reliability and cost of alternative shipping services including services from competitors who are
larger, serve more cities and have more financial resources. The amounts shipped in AirNet&#146;s air
transportation network during any particular time period can fluctuate significantly due to the
foregoing factors. A downward fluctuation in demand for AirNet&#146;s Bank Services and Express
Services could have a material adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>The U.S. aviation industry is experiencing a shortage of qualified pilots which could adversely
impact AirNet&#146;s flight schedule and air transportation network.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The U.S. aviation industry is currently experiencing a shortage of qualified pilots. AirNet
competes for qualified pilots with major passenger airlines, regional passenger carriers,
fractional ownership operators, corporate flight departments and other cargo airlines. Because of
the resurgence in airline passenger travel and increased hiring by commercial passenger airlines,
the competition for obtaining qualified pilots has significantly increased. Consequently, AirNet
has experienced, and is currently experiencing, higher pilot attrition which has caused pilot
shortages. To date, AirNet has generally been able to complete scheduled flights using line
pilots, reserve pilots and instructors, flight rated management or third party contract air
carriers. These remedies have resulted in increased pilot travel expense and subcontracted air
route costs. Flight cancellations and associated revenue losses have been minimal. In an effort
to address the competition for available pilots, AirNet has implemented pilot compensation
increases and has implemented bonus arrangements to attract and retain qualified pilots. AirNet
has also increased its pilot recruiting and training activities. The compensation increases and
bonus arrangements will result in a significant increase in AirNet&#146;s operating wages and benefits
expense; however, to date, this increase has been offset by the overall lower number of pilots.
There can be no assurance that the compensation increases and bonus arrangements will be successful
in attracting or retaining qualified pilots, or that scheduled flights will not be cancelled,
resulting in revenue losses, because of pilot shortages.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet charges its customers a fuel surcharge as a percentage of base transportation charges.
AirNet&#146;s base transportation revenues have historically been sufficient to recover increases in
fuel costs after application of the fuel surcharge. As AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues decline,
AirNet may not have base transportation revenues sufficient to recover increases in fuel costs,
which would have a material adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s results of operations. Additionally,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s ability to dispose of its aircraft in response to any reductions in its air transportation
network will be limited by the age and cargo configuration of such aircraft. AirNet&#146;s aircraft,
including its Learjets, are relatively older, higher use aircraft that are not configured for
passenger use. Lower use Learjets with similar ages, lower operating hours and configured for
passenger use have been averaging in excess of 18&nbsp;months on the market prior to sale. AirNet&#146;s
ability to dispose of its Learjets will be restricted by such market factors and may require
extended holding periods prior to sale. The cost of converting such Learjets to passenger use will
also limit the market for such aircraft and the value AirNet may receive upon their sale. A
significant portion of AirNet&#146;s other aircraft are subject to similar factors that will limit their
marketability. AirNet&#146;s operating facility located at Rickenbacker International Airport is a
specialty use facility which is not readily adaptable to uses other than aircraft operations. The
specialty nature of AirNet&#146;s Rickenbacker Facility and the fact that it is not located at a major
metropolitan airport will limit its value and could result in an extended holding period prior to
disposition.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s delivery operations are subject to various federal, state and local regulations that in
many instances require permits and licenses. Failure by AirNet to maintain required permits or
licenses, or to comply with the applicable regulations, could result in substantial fines or
possible revocation of AirNet&#146;s authority to conduct certain of its operations. AirNet&#146;s flight
operations are regulated by the FAA under Part&nbsp;135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Among
other things, these regulations govern permissible flight and duty time for aviation flight crews.
The FAA has contemplated, from time to time, certain changes in flight and duty time guidelines
which, if adopted, could increase AirNet&#146;s operating costs. These changes, if adopted, could also
require AirNet and other operators regulated by the FAA to hire additional flight crew personnel.
In addition, Congress, from time to time, has considered various means, including excise taxes, to
raise revenues directly from the airline industry to pay for air traffic control facilities and
personnel. There can be no assurances that Congress will not change the current federal excise tax
rate or enact new excise taxes, which could adversely affect AirNet&#146;s business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On February&nbsp;14, 2007, the FAA sent proposed legislation to Congress that would significantly alter
the manner in which the federal government funds the FAA. The proposed legislation, entitled &#147;The
Next Generation Air Transportation System Financing Reform Act of 2007&#148; would generate revenue to
fund FAA operations from a number of sources, including the imposition of certain fees for using
the air traffic system and increases in the fuel tax. Neither the Senate nor the House of
Representatives adopted the FAA&#146;s proposed legislation, and the Senate and the House of

have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation industry, including
independent contractors providing services similar to those utilized by AirNet, are employees

commercial airlines. These screening procedures have resulted in additional tender time for
packages transported on the commercial airlines in certain locations and during certain times. In
addition, the TSA continues to review and consider additional package screening requirements and
changes to the vendor screening procedures, which AirNet may need to perform on packages from its
customers. Many commercial airlines are also adding security surcharges to shipments.

ramp access to its aircraft, thereby increasing tender time from customers. Changes in chain of
custody requirements could also potentially cause AirNet to incur additional costs to staff
additional hours at certain locations. In response to security-related procedures being
implemented, AirNet added a security surcharge in 2002 for its Bank Services and Express Services
customers. Although the surcharge has helped offset the increasing costs associated with security
issues, AirNet&#146;s current surcharge program may not be sufficient to cover all new costs it may

revenue. In the event of a catastrophic accident, AirNet may not be able to secure liability
insurance for its business or secure such insurance at a reasonable cost.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Environmental concerns may arise in connection with AirNet&#146;s operation at its Rickenbacker Facility
on leased land with known pollution conditions.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005, AirNet completed construction of its Rickenbacker Facility on land leased from the
Authority. Portions of the leased land, as well as portions of the aircraft ramp, on which AirNet
conducts a significant portion of its operations at the Rickenbacker Facility, contain known
pollution conditions. The appropriate amended post closure plan and no further action letters
addressing these areas were supplied to AirNet by the Authority prior to beginning construction.
Identification of additional pollution conditions on the leased land or attached ramp could
increase AirNet&#146;s costs and have an adverse affect on its ability to operate at the Rickenbacker
Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>If AirNet is unable to maintain sufficient liquidity as AirNet continues to implement its business
strategy and other strategic alternatives, AirNet may be unable to sustain its operations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet believes that it currently has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations, including the
payment of capital expenditures and other contractual obligations, from operations, cash on hand
and tax refunds. However, to maintain sufficient liquidity as AirNet implements its business
strategy and other strategic initiatives, AirNet may need access to additional or other sources of
funding. AirNet is exploring other financing alternatives which may include sales of aircraft and
other assets and leasing. AirNet&#146;s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement currently limits
the aggregate amount which AirNet may pay as expense under operating leases as well as the
aggregate amount of assets which may be the subject of sales transactions or sale and leaseback
transactions. The availability and level of financing sources cannot be assured and the inability
of AirNet to maintain current sources or to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms would
have a material adverse impact on the ability of AirNet to sustain its operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Limitations on AirNet&#146;s ability to borrow could adversely affect AirNet&#146;s financial condition and

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet has a revolving credit facility (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) which is
scheduled to expire on October&nbsp;15, 2008. AirNet&#146;s revolving credit agreement is used to fund
working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements. As of December&nbsp;31,
2007, there were no loans outstanding under this revolving credit facility. As of December&nbsp;31,
2007, AirNet had approximately $0.8&nbsp;million in standby letters of credit outstanding related to
insurance programs, which reduced the amount available to borrow to approximately $14.2&nbsp;million
under the revolving credit facility. Any substantial indebtedness incurred under the revolving
credit facility could: (1)&nbsp;require AirNet to dedicate a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">substantial portion of cash flows from
operating activities to payments on AirNet&#146;s indebtedness, which would reduce the cash flows
available to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;
(2)&nbsp;limit AirNet&#146;s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in AirNet&#146;s business and
the industry in which AirNet operates; and (3)&nbsp;limit AirNet&#146;s ability to borrow additional funds.
AirNet&#146;s liquidity and its ability to meet its current and long-term financial
obligations as they become due will be dependent upon AirNet&#146;s financial performance, its ability
to meet financial covenants under the revolving credit facility and its ability to replace or
extend the revolving credit facility when it becomes due. AirNet&#146;s breach of a financial covenant
or other provision of its revolving credit facility would constitute a default and would permit its
lender to pursue the remedies available to it under the revolving credit facility. These remedies
include terminating AirNet&#146;s ability to make any new borrowings and accelerating the repayment of
any then existing borrowings under the revolving credit facility. If AirNet&#146;s lender declared a
default, there is no assurance that AirNet would have adequate resources or be able to obtain other
financing to pay any amounts owed under the revolving credit facility. AirNet&#146;s failure to meet
these financial covenants would have a material adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s financial position and
ability to continue operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>AirNet may not be able to raise future capital through debt financing which could adversely affect
AirNet&#146;s ability to execute its business strategy.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet may be unable to raise capital for future capital expenditures through debt financing.
AirNet&#146;s inability to secure debt financing would limit its ability to purchase new aircraft and
change the current mix of aircraft in its fleet. The current aircraft in AirNet&#146;s fleet were
originally designed to meet the delivery needs of AirNet&#146;s bank customers and have relatively small
cargo capacities. AirNet&#146;s current aircraft are not readily adaptable to the transportation of
many types of air cargo, which generally require greater aircraft capacity and lower operating
costs. AirNet&#146;s inability to secure debt financing to purchase aircraft that are more suitable to
the transportation of Express Services cargo may adversely affect AirNet&#146;s ability to execute its
business strategy.

reporting for purposes of complying with Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to annually assess the
effectiveness of AirNet&#146;s internal control over financial reporting beginning with the fiscal year
ending December&nbsp;31, 2007 and a report by AirNet&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm
addressing the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting beginning with the
fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2008. During the course of AirNet&#146;s testing, AirNet may identify
deficiencies and weaknesses, which AirNet may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline
imposed by the regulations promulgated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the
requirements for Section&nbsp;404. If AirNet&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm is unable
to give a favorable report on the effectiveness of AirNet&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting beginning with the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2008, the result could be a material
adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s reputation, financial condition and on the market price of AirNet&#146;s
common shares.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Anti-takeover provisions may delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of AirNet by a
third party.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Provisions of AirNet&#146;s amended articles and code of regulations and of the Ohio Revised Code,
together or separately, could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change
in control of AirNet and limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the
future for the common shares. Among other things, these provisions require certain supermajority
votes, establish advance notice procedures for shareholder nomination of candidates for election as
directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders&#146; meetings, eliminate
cumulative voting in the election of directors and provide that directors may only be removed from
office for cause.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s amended articles authorize the board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 preferred
shares without further shareholder approval, subject to any limitations prescribed by law and the
rules and regulations of AMEX. The preferred shares could have dividend, liquidation, conversion
and other rights and privileges that are superior or senior to the common shares. Issuance of
preferred shares could result in the dilution of the voting power of the common shares, adversely
affect holders of the common shares in the event of liquidation of AirNet or delay, defer or
prevent a change in control of AirNet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, Section&nbsp;1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code contains provisions that require shareholder
approval of any proposed &#147;control share acquisition&#148; of any Ohio corporation at any of three voting
power thresholds: one-fifth, one-third and a majority. Further, Chapter&nbsp;1704 of the Ohio Revised
Code contains provisions that restrict specified business combinations and other transactions
between an Ohio corporation and interested shareholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;20, 2004, AirNet entered into a land lease with the Authority to lease approximately 8
acres located within Rickenbacker International Airport. AirNet completed construction of its new
Rickenbacker Facility in May&nbsp;2005 and AirNet&#146;s relocation to the Rickenbacker Facility was
completed in June&nbsp;2005. AirNet&#146;s corporate and operational functions


that were previously conducted at the Port Columbus Facility and the administrative functions
previously conducted at 555 Morrison Road in Gahanna, Ohio were consolidated at the new
Rickenbacker Facility. Rickenbacker is located in Franklin and Pickaway Counties, Ohio, southeast
of Columbus, Ohio, approximately fifteen miles from AirNet&#146;s former Port Columbus Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Through August&nbsp;2006, AirNet also maintained certain assets at Port Columbus for dispensing aviation
fuel under the terms and conditions of a separate lease agreement (the &#147;Fuel Farm Lease&#148;). The
Fuel Farm Lease required AirNet to return the premises leased under the Fuel Farm Lease to their
original condition upon the termination of the lease. In lieu of returning the premises to their
original condition, the Fuel Farm Lease provided that the Authority could take title to any
improvements constructed by AirNet on the leased premises. On August&nbsp;17, 2006, AirNet conveyed all
of its fuel farm assets to the Authority for $1 and a release of any future liabilities associated
with the Fuel Farm Lease and the fuel farm assets, other than any liabilities related to
environmental conditions which may be imposed by any governmental agency. The Fuel Farm Lease also
was terminated on August&nbsp;17, 2006. As a result of the conveyance of the fuel farm assets to the
Authority and the termination of the Fuel Farm Lease, AirNet was relieved of its obligation to
return the leased premises to their original condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There were 198 flying days in 2007 and 199 flying days in 2006. There were 53&nbsp;weekends in 2007 and
52&nbsp;weekends in 2006. Bank Services revenues and Express Services revenues are presented net of
federal excise tax fees which were approximately 2% for Bank Services revenues and approximately 3%
for Express Services revenues in each of the periods presented.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Bank Services revenues declined approximately 11% in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to a decrease in
cancelled check volumes. While AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenue declined, AirNet&#146;s income from
continuing operations benefited from a decrease in operating expenses as a result of the reduction
in AirNet&#146;s flight schedule in March and October&nbsp;2007 as discussed below. AirNet&#146;s total Express
Services revenues decreased approximately 2% in 2007 from 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet generally assesses its Bank Services customers a fuel surcharge, which is generally based on
the Oil Price Index Summary &#151; Columbus, Ohio (OPIS)&nbsp;index. The average fuel price on the OPIS
index increased approximately 10% in 2007 from 2006 and increased 13% in 2006 as compared to 2005.
AirNet also assesses most of its Express Services customers a fuel surcharge based on the OPIS
index, which is adjusted monthly based on changes in the OPIS index. As index rates fluctuate
above a set threshold, surcharge rates will increase or decrease accordingly. The fuel surcharge
rate is applied to
the revenue amount billed to Bank Services and Express Services customers. AirNet assesses certain
Express Services customers fuel surcharges based on negotiated contractual rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Fuel surcharge revenues for Bank Services in 2007 exceeded the comparable amounts in 2006 by

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">approximately $1.2&nbsp;million, or 13%. A substantial portion of the Express Services price increases
that were instituted in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 increased the base
transportation rates and lowered fuel surcharge rates. Management believes Bank Services fuel
surcharge revenues in 2008 will decline from 2007 amounts because of declining Bank Services
revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue yields per pound are similar for Bank Services and Express Services shipments; however,
because the density of cancelled check shipments is much greater than the typical Express Services
shipment, contribution margins on Bank Services shipments are substantially higher than Express
Services shipments based on the cubic dimension of shipments. Due to the unscheduled nature of
Express Services non-charter point-to-point surface shipments, pick-up and delivery costs per
shipment are higher for Express Services shipments than Bank Services shipments. Lower check
delivery volumes due to the increased use of image products and other electronic alternatives to
the physical movement of cancelled checks will contribute to a significant reduction in AirNet&#146;s
Bank Services revenues and contribution margin in future periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Bank Services shipments consist primarily of cancelled checks (checks processed for settlement),
proof of deposit (unprocessed checks) and interoffice mail delivery. These shipments are
transported on AirNet&#146;s transportation network and, to a lesser extent, on commercial passenger
airlines and dedicated AirNet aircraft charters for specific banks. Total net Bank Services
revenues decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to, but to a lesser extent than, the decrease in total
Bank Services pounds shipped per flying day. Weekday cancelled check pounds shipped per flying day
declined approximately 31% in 2007 from 2006. Proof of deposit and interoffice mail deliveries
also declined, resulting in an aggregate decrease in total Bank Services pounds shipped per flying
day of approximately 26% in 2007 from 2006. Bank Services cancelled check pounds shipped per
flying day have declined at an increasing year-over-year rate. Total cancelled check pounds
shipped per flying day declined in each quarter of 2007 by approximately 22%, 23%, 25% and 30% when
compared to the respective quarter of 2006. Additionally, Bank Services cancelled check pounds
shipped per weekend have decreased approximately 24% in 2007 from 2006. AirNet expects these
trends to continue at an accelerating rate in 2008 and thereafter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Primarily as a result of the decline in cancelled check volumes, AirNet&#146;s weekday revenues per
flying day and weekend revenues per weekend, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 13%
and 21%, respectively, in 2007 as compared to 2006. These declines were partially offset by a 3%
increase in fuel surcharge revenues as well as price increases implemented in the fourth quarter of
2007. AirNet expects Bank Services revenues will continue to decline at an accelerating rate in
2008 and thereafter as a result of service cancellations driven by a decline in cancelled check
volume and as a result of the significant reduction in the number of flights conducted by AirNet&#146;s
air transportation network, as described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2007 AirNet announced a new pricing structure and price increase for AirNet&#146;s weekday
Bank Services customers. The new pricing structure incorporates tiered zone pricing features where
the cities AirNet serves are categorized by current shipping volumes based on both origins and
destinations and a core zone support charge effective when dispatches are terminated.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2007 and 2006, as a result of decreased demand for air transportation services, AirNet
received a number of service cancellations from its banking customers. These cancellations, which
took effect at various times during 2007 and 2006, did not impact AirNet&#146;s banking revenues on a
full year basis for the year they took effect. The full financial effect of such periodic service
cancellations is not realized until future reporting periods that commence on or after the
effective date of the cancellations. AirNet has also experienced declines in Bank Services
revenues as a result of lower shipment weights on services which are subject to variable pricing
and as a result of price reductions on fixed rate services as a result of lower shipment weights.
AirNet has also received additional service cancellations from its banking customers which become

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">effective in the first and second quarters of 2008. These service cancellations represented
approximately $12.3&nbsp;million of revenues on an annual basis in 2007, including approximately $2.2
million of fuel surcharge revenues. The 2007 and 2008 service cancellations, when combined with
the reduction in AirNet&#146;s air transportation network, as discussed below, will result in a
significant further decline in AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues in 2008 and thereafter.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet continues to consult with its banking customers to determine their future requirements for
air transportation services as they transition to image products and other electronic alternatives
to the physical movement of cancelled checks. As a result of past discussions, AirNet made
significant changes to its air transportation network to meet the evolving service needs of its
Bank Services customers. These changes, which became effective March&nbsp;26, 2007, resulted in the
elimination of 45 flights, or approximately 10%, of AirNet&#146;s weekday flight schedule. A
substantial portion of the shipment volume previously transported on the eliminated flights was
transitioned to other AirNet flights. AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues declined by approximately
$4.2&nbsp;million on an annual basis, including approximately $0.5&nbsp;million of fuel surcharges, as a
direct result of these changes to AirNet&#146;s air transportation network. This decline in AirNet&#146;s
Bank Services revenues was in addition to the reductions in Bank Services revenues resulting from
the service cancellations, lower shipment weights and price reductions discussed in the preceding
paragraphs. In addition, in October&nbsp;2007 AirNet made further changes to its air transportation
network to meet the needs of its Bank Services customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Reductions in AirNet&#146;s variable operating costs resulting from the March&nbsp;2007 and October&nbsp;2007
changes in its air transportation network have both substantially offset the loss of revenues
including those resulting directly from these changes. AirNet did not reduce the number of
aircraft in its fleet as a result of these changes in its air transportation network due to the
number of aircraft needed to meet the continuing service requirements of its Bank Services and
Express Services customers. AirNet expects that the accelerating decline in Bank Services revenues
in 2008 and thereafter will require substantial further reductions in AirNet&#146;s air transportation
network, including aircraft disposals.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet provides Express Services to customers through its air transportation network, air cargo
charter services, commercial airlines and point-to-point surface shipments. AirNet&#146;s Express
Services customers typically operate in time-critical, time-definite, and high control delivery
markets, including medical testing laboratories, radioactive pharmaceuticals, medical equipment,
controlled sensitive media and mission critical parts. AirNet believes its air transportation
network provides certain competitive advantages over other freight forwarders that must rely
primarily upon commercial passenger airlines to process their shipments. These advantages include
later tendering times, better on-time performance, greater control of shipments, reliable shipment
tracking systems and greater flexibility in the design of transportation solutions for customers
with specific needs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Express Revenues &#151; Non Charter </B>represents revenues AirNet derives from Express shipments on
AirNet&#146;s air transportation network, commercial passenger airlines and point-to-point surface
(ground only) shipments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The total number of Non Charter Express shipments declined approximately 15% in 2007 from 2006.
The number of Non Charter shipments transported on AirNet&#146;s air transportation network decreased
approximately 15% in 2007 from 2006. The number of Non Charter Express shipments transported on
commercial passenger airlines decreased approximately 10% in 2007 from 2006. The number of Non
Charter Express shipments transported via point-to-point surface shipments decreased approximately
20% in 2007 from 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues before fuel surcharges for point-to-point surface shipments increased approximately 22% in
2007 from 2006. However, revenues before fuel surcharges for point-to-point surface shipments
decreased approximately 1% in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 from 2006 primarily as a result
of significant reduced shipping volume from one Express Services customer in the third quarter of
2007 as discussed below. This revenue loss was partially offset by increased shipping revenue from
another Express Services customer requiring high custody and security control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet instituted a price increase on July&nbsp;16, 2007 for one of its larger Express Services
customers that provides distribution services to the entertainment industry. The price increase
was implemented because of very low contribution margins that AirNet was realizing from this
customer. The customer significantly reduced shipping with AirNet shortly after the price

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">increase
was implemented. This customer represented approximately 3% and 7% of Express Services revenues
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Express Revenues &#151; Charter </B>represent revenues AirNet derives from scheduled and unscheduled
dedicated cargo charters transported on AirNet&#146;s airline and on aircraft operated by other third
parties. Cargo charter models, including ACMI charter flights, typically involve flying an
aircraft for a single customer under a customer defined itinerary whereby the customer buys the
entire aircraft&#146;s capacity. AirNet typically provides dedicated charter solutions for customers
involved in medical testing laboratories, radioactive pharmaceuticals, medical equipment,
controlled sensitive media and mission critical parts industries. AirNet also provides dedicated
charter flights for ACMI customers. The increase in revenues in
Express Revenues &#151; Charter in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to an increase in the number of
charters for customers in these industries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet is implementing growth plans to expand dedicated scheduled and on demand cargo charter
services for customers in niche markets requiring high control, rapid delivery and non conforming
delivery times. This plan involves expanding charter services for existing customers, extending
charter services to other customers and market segments, and creating small specialized networks
for specific customers. This cargo charter business model involves flying an aircraft for a single
customer under a customer defined itinerary where the customer buys the entire aircraft&#146;s capacity.
AirNet&#146;s current customers for these services include medical testing laboratories, radioactive
pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, controlled sensitive media firms and other companies that have
mission critical operations. Additionally, AirNet intends to grow by providing express feeder
service through dedicated charters for the large integrated carriers. This cargo charter model
involves flying dedicated feeder charters where the cost structure is predominately ACMI. The
feeder ACMI market is a market within a competitive contract cargo carrier market, and primarily
includes express feeder service to the large integrated carriers such as United Parcel Service
(&#147;UPS&#148;), DHL, Purolator and Federal Express Corporation (&#147;FedEx&#148;). This ACMI market is highly
fragmented with many small operators. AirNet believes that growth opportunities exist in the ACMI
market because of large integrated carriers&#146; desire to work with a smaller number of feeder
companies, a shift in emphasis from price to service reliability, and consolidation occurring
within the airline sector in which AirNet operates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There can be no assurance that AirNet can make a transition to an air carrier primarily serving
dedicated scheduled and on demand cargo charter customers, that related alternatives or cost
reductions can be implemented or, if fully implemented, the transition to dedicated scheduled and
on demand cargo charter markets, together with such alternatives or cost reductions, will be
sufficient to counter the trend of declining Bank Services revenues and profitability in future
periods.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Aviation Services revenues primarily relate to AirNet&#146;s fixed base operation services for fuel
sales and aircraft maintenance provided in Columbus, Ohio. The increase in Aviation Services
revenues primarily resulted from certain retail maintenance services provided to Pinnacle Air, LLC
as described below under &#147;Sale of Jetride&#146;s Passenger Charter Business&#148;. AirNet also provides
aircraft maintenance management services and retail maintenance services for other aircraft.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Sale of Jetride&#146;s Passenger Charter Business</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;26, 2006, AirNet, Jetride, and Pinnacle Air, LLC (&#147;Pinnacle&#148;) entered into a purchase
agreement regarding the sale of Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business to Pinnacle. The sale was
completed on September&nbsp;26, 2006. The purchase price was $41.0&nbsp;million in cash, of which $40.0
million was consideration for the sale of nine company-owned aircraft and related engine
maintenance programs and $1.0&nbsp;million was consideration for the sale of all of the outstanding
capital stock of a newly-created subsidiary of Jetride, also called Jetride, Inc. (&#147;New Jetride&#148;).
Of the total consideration, $40.0&nbsp;million was paid at closing and $1.0&nbsp;million was paid into escrow
to cover potential indemnification claims made by Pinnacle. Since no indemnification claims were
made, the escrow amount was released to AirNet in two installments of $500,000 each in March&nbsp;2007
and August&nbsp;2007. AirNet retained the net working capital of the Jetride passenger charter
business, which was approximately $2.2&nbsp;million as of the closing date. In connection with the
closing of the sale transaction, Jetride repaid in full six term loans which had been secured by
aircraft used in Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business. The aggregate principal amount of the loans
repaid was approximately $28.2&nbsp;million plus accrued interest and early termination prepayment
penalties of approximately $0.3&nbsp;million through the repayment date. Following repayment of
Jetride&#146;s loans and expenses related to the transaction, AirNet used the remaining sale proceeds to
further reduce debt outstanding under AirNet&#146;s secured revolving credit facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the transaction, AirNet agreed to provide certain transition services to
Pinnacle and its subsidiaries for various specified time periods and various monthly fees, which
initially aggregated to approximately $37,500 per month, primarily for aircraft maintenance
services. Effective March&nbsp;25, 2007, Pinnacle and AirNet extended the term of various transition
services provided by AirNet to Pinnacle on a month to month basis. AirNet and Pinnacle also agreed
to reduce the monthly fees for such transition services to $36,250 per month. In addition, in
September&nbsp;2006, AirNet entered into three subleases with New Jetride, under which New Jetride
leased a portion of AirNet&#146;s facilities located at the Rickenbacker Facility, Dallas Love Field and
Birmingham International Airport. The aggregate monthly lease payment under the three subleases
was approximately $10,000. Pinnacle terminated its subleases of AirNet&#146;s facilities located at
Birmingham International Airport and Dallas Love Field effective April&nbsp;30, 2007 and June&nbsp;30, 2007,
respectively. Pinnacle terminated its

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total aircraft fuel expense decreased in 2007 from 2006 primarily as a result of fewer hours flown.
The reduction caused by fewer hours flown was partially offset by an increase in average fuel
prices. The 2007 average annual fuel price, as reflected by the OPIS index, increased
approximately 10% from the 2006 annual fuel price. Because a portion of the decrease in hours
flown was attributable to routes subcontracted to other carriers, a portion of the decrease in
aircraft fuel expense was offset by increased contracted air costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Aircraft Maintenance</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Aircraft maintenance is primarily based on pre-determined inspection intervals, determined by hours
flown, cycles and the number of aircraft take-offs and landings. High use, older aircraft that are
no longer in production, such as those in AirNet&#146;s cargo fleet, incur higher maintenance costs than
lower use, newer aircraft. The increase in aircraft maintenance expense reflects the following
factors: expensing approximately 75% of the engine maintenance plan prepayments, as further
described below; the increase in retail maintenance services provided to third parties; the timing
of major maintenance

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">events; and the age of AirNet&#146;s cargo fleet, including Learjets which averaged
approximately 26&nbsp;years in service at the end of 2007, and the related increase in maintenance
required on older aircraft.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet uses manufacturer engine maintenance plans to provide recurring inspection maintenance and
major overhaul maintenance for most of the engines in its Learjet fleet. At December&nbsp;31, 2007,
essentially all of AirNet&#146;s Learjet 35 aircraft engines were covered under manufacturer engine
maintenance plans. Under the manufacturer engine maintenance plans, AirNet pays in advance for
certain maintenance, repair and overhaul costs based on an amount per hour for each hour flown. In
October&nbsp;2006, following the write down of a substantial portion of the prepaid assets related to
these engine maintenance plans in connection with the 2006 asset impairment charge, AirNet changed
its estimate of the portion of these payments that should be capitalized and began expensing
approximately 75% of the prepayments, which are included in aircraft maintenance expense. In 2008,
AirNet expects to expense approximately 77% of the prepayments due to an increase in manufacturer
maintenance plan rates. Management estimates that expensing payments made under manufacturer
engine maintenance plans at this rate will maintain engine book values at the amounts determined to
be appropriate as part of the 2006 and 2007 asset impairment charges. The portion of capitalized
prepayments totaled approximately $4.1&nbsp;million and $3.7&nbsp;million, respectively, at December&nbsp;31, 2007
and 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2005, following the write down of aircraft assets in connection with the 2005 asset
impairment charge, management determined that none of the major maintenance expenditures incurred
after September&nbsp;30, 2005, with the exception of engine repairs and improvements and maintenance
payments made under manufacturer engine maintenance plans, extended the useful life of the
aircraft. Consequently, beginning in October&nbsp;2005, such expenditures were charged to aircraft
maintenance expense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet does not expect to capitalize any significant expenditures made in 2008 related to the
aircraft fleet, with the exception of certain major engine repairs and improvements to engines not
covered by manufacturer engine maintenance plans, and a portion of the prepayments under
manufacturer engine maintenance plans related to the Learjet 35 aircraft. Consequently, the timing
and number of required major aircraft maintenance expenditures can have a significant impact on
AirNet&#146;s results of operations and comparability between periods. As available capacity on
AirNet&#146;s air transportation
network permits, AirNet has and will continue to coordinate the timing of aircraft disposals to
permit deferral or elimination of major aircraft maintenance expenditures and related aircraft
maintenance expense. During 2007, AirNet reduced the use of one aircraft nearing major aircraft
maintenance events, which was ultimately sold in February&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Operating Wages and Benefits</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Included in operating wages and benefits are those for AirNet&#146;s aircraft pilots. Because of the
resurgence in airline passenger travel and increased hiring by commercial passenger airlines, the
competition for obtaining qualified pilots has significantly increased. Consequently, AirNet has
experienced, and is currently experiencing, higher pilot attrition which has caused pilot
shortages. To date, AirNet has generally been able to complete scheduled flights using line
pilots, reserve pilots and instructors, flight rated management or third party contract air
carriers. These remedies have resulted in increased pilot travel expense and subcontracted air
route costs. Flight cancellations and associated revenue losses have been minimal. In an effort
to address the competition for available pilots, AirNet has implemented pilot compensation
increases and has implemented bonus arrangements to attract and retain qualified pilots. AirNet
has also increased its pilot recruiting and training activities. The compensation increases and
bonus arrangements will result in a significant increase in AirNet&#146;s operating wages and benefits
expense; however, to date, this increase has been offset by the overall lower number of pilots. As
a result of the increased pilot recruiting and implementation of pilot compensation increases and
bonus arrangements, AirNet expects to increase its retention of qualified pilots in 2008 and
thereafter. However, there can be no assurance that the compensation increases and bonus
arrangements will be successful in attracting or retaining qualified pilots, or that scheduled
flights will not be cancelled, resulting in revenue losses, because of pilot shortages.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Costs related to back-up and subcontracted air routes increased approximately 2% in 2007 from 2006
primarily due to an increase in the use of subcontracted air routes for certain Express Services
customers and as a substitute for AirNet aircraft when AirNet flight crews were not available.
AirNet expects to utilize subcontracted air routes to a greater extent in the first quarter of 2008
because of aircrew shortages. Commercial freight costs decreased approximately 10% from 2006 to
2007 primarily due to the decrease in Bank Services and Express Services shipments transported on
commercial passenger airlines.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Contracted courier costs for Bank Services decreased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to fewer
Express Services and Bank Services shipments as compared to the same periods in 2006. Primarily as
a result of service cancellations driven by a decline in cancelled check volume, total Bank
Services pounds shipped per flying day decreased approximately 26% in 2007 from 2006. The total
number of Non Charter Express shipments declined approximately 15% in 2007 from 2006, due in part
to significantly reduced shipping of a large Express Services customer in the second half of 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Aircraft depreciation decreased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to lower aircraft values caused by
the impairment charge recorded in 2006. Additionally, aircraft engine depreciation, which is based
on engine hours operated, decreased because of the decline in flight hours in 2007 compared to
2006. Management expects 2008 depreciation expense to remain below 2007 levels as a result of
lower aircraft values resulting from asset impairment charges and decreased flight hours.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2006, AirNet decided to market for sale all nine of the Cessna 310 Piston cargo
aircraft as a result of the need to reduce its airline capacity and operating costs. At that date,
AirNet determined that the plan of sale criteria of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 had been met. The carrying value
of the assets was determined to approximate the estimated fair value less cost to sell, based on
then recent aircraft appraisals. In November&nbsp;2006, AirNet entered into an agreement to sell all
nine of its Cessna 310 aircraft for approximately $0.5&nbsp;million. AirNet delivered seven aircraft in
the first quarter of 2007 and delivered the two remaining aircraft in June&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;10, 2007, one of AirNet&#146;s Learjets was damaged and subsequently declared not airworthy.
AirNet received insurance proceeds of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million on April&nbsp;19, 2007 related to this
loss. The gain on disposition of aircraft primarily reflects the excess of insurance proceeds over
the net book value of this Learjet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2008, as a part of a planned cost reduction, AirNet entered into an agreement to sell
one of its Learjet aircraft for approximately $0.5&nbsp;million. AirNet delivered the aircraft in the
first quarter of 2008. Additionally, in February&nbsp;2008, a Learjet aircraft was damaged by another
air operator&#146;s baggage tug and subsequently removed from AirNet&#146;s aircraft fleet. As of the date
of AirNet&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, AirNet has not determined a final disposition with regard
to such damaged aircraft.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet is implementing growth plans to expand dedicated scheduled and on demand cargo charter
services for customers in niche markets requiring high control, rapid delivery and non conforming
delivery times. This plan involves expanding charter services for existing customers, extending
charter services to other customers and market segments, and creating small specialized networks
for specific customers. AirNet will operate a smaller national network as the bank business
changes and may become an air carrier that primarily serves charter customers in a scheduled and on
demand environment. AirNet expects to implement cost reductions in its administration, ground and air
network operations coinciding with adjustments to the changing Bank Services and Express Services
business conditions. AirNet will also evaluate and adjust its current fleet of aircraft types to
support ACMI and dedicated cargo charter service requirements. AirNet expects to make additional
changes in its aircraft fleet over time both in terms of reductions or additions of aircraft and
aircraft types.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial

Assets&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;). AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets when events or
changes in circumstances indicate, in management&#146;s judgment, that AirNet&#146;s assets might be impaired
and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the
carrying value of those assets. The carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to
estimated fair market value if lower than carrying value. In determining the estimated fair market
value of the assets, AirNet considers information provided by third party valuation firms retained
to assist AirNet in completing its analysis, published market data and recent transactions
involving sales of similar assets.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s cargo airline was originally designed, and continues to operate, primarily to meet the
needs of Bank Services customers. As a result of continuing trends in the implementation of
electronic payment alternatives and electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks, as of September&nbsp;30, 2007, AirNet evaluated for impairment its long-lived assets used in its
airline operations, consisting primarily of aircraft, aircraft parts and its airport hangar and
office facility located at the Rickenbacker Facility. The undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets including disposal values were less than the related carrying values and
therefore, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, the estimated fair values of these assets
were compared to carrying value and the carrying values were reduced by a $2.2&nbsp;million non-cash
impairment charge. As a result of AirNet&#146;s evaluation of the required valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets, no tax benefit was recognized related to this impairment charge as disclosed

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The determination of undiscounted cash flows involves estimates of future cash flows, revenues,
operating expenses and disposal values. The projections of these amounts represent management&#146;s
best estimates at the time of the review. Management&#146;s estimates are significantly affected by the
continuing uncertainty of the timing and rate of decline in Bank Services revenues that are being
impacted by the implementation of electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks and AirNet&#146;s potential to grow other lines of cargo business as alternative sources of
revenues. AirNet will continue to explore cost saving initiatives and alternative sources of
revenue; however, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, until such strategies are
developed, AirNet has assigned minimal probabilities to those strategies in AirNet&#146;s determination
of future undiscounted cash flows. In the absence of additional cost saving initiatives or
alternative sources of revenue, it is likely that future determinations of estimated cash flows
will be less than the carrying value of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets and may result in additional
impairment charges. As a result, AirNet will be required to monitor the carrying value of its
long-lived assets relative to estimated fair values in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The impairment charge was based on a range of estimated fair values provided by third party
appraisal firms. Consistent with how management determined the 2006 asset impairment charge as
described below, and because of the current uncertainties in the business environment, management
determined that the low end of the range of fair values of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets as provided
by the third party appraisal firms was the appropriate estimate of fair value at September&nbsp;30,
2007. Accordingly, the carrying values of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets were reduced by an
approximate $2.2&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge. The determination of the adjusted carrying
value is a management estimate based upon the third party appraisals and the subjective factors
discussed above. It is possible that the proceeds from future sales of assets, if any, could be
greater than or less than current carrying values. Further, if management uses different
assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different
than those anticipated, additional impairment charges may be required.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet also recorded an impairment charge in the three month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2006.
AirNet performed the impairment tests required by SFAS No.&nbsp;144 for that quarter ended September&nbsp;30,
2006 and concluded that its long-lived assets used in its Delivery Services reportable segment were
impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $24.6&nbsp;million was recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2006.
The impairment charge was based on a range of estimated fair values provided by third party
appraisal firms. The range of appraised fair values related to AirNet&#146;s long lived assets was
approximately $49.7&nbsp;million to $27.7&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2006, reflecting different market
factors, holding periods and possible asset disposition scenarios that potentially could have been
elected by AirNet as it evaluated its strategies in response to the business environment.
Management determined that the low end of the range of fair values was the appropriate estimate of
fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2006, and accordingly, management wrote down the carrying value of
AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets to approximately $27.7&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s effective tax rates, excluding the effect of discontinued operations, were 38.1% for 2007
and (14.2%) for 2006. The effective tax rate for 2006 deviates from statutory federal, state and
local rates primarily as a result of tax expense from an increase in the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets of approximately $6.2&nbsp;million in 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet filed for a discretionary income tax method change with the Internal
Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;). The income tax method change relates to deducting for tax purposes
engine maintenance plan prepayments when paid that were previously deferred and deducted in later
periods. On March&nbsp;11, 2008, AirNet received notice from the IRS of approval for AirNet&#146;s
discretionary income tax method change. As required by SFAS No.&nbsp;109, &#147;<I>Accounting for Income Taxes</I>&#148;
(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;109&#148;), the effect of the method change will be reported in the period in which IRS
approval is obtained; therefore, AirNet has not reflected the impact of the method change in the
December&nbsp;31, 2007 consolidated financial statements. AirNet is in the process of evaluating the
total impact of the method change; however, it will materially reduce AirNet&#146;s current taxes
payable. Additionally, its deferred tax assets and the need for the associated valuation allowance
could materially change. As a result of the approval by the IRS for the method change, AirNet has
applied for a refund of 2007 federal tax estimated payments of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million which
AirNet expects to receive in 2008. Additionally, AirNet intends to file an amended tax return for
a refund of income taxes previously paid of approximately $5.6&nbsp;million, the payment of which is
subject to review and approval by the IRS. AirNet expects to receive this refund in 2009.

discontinued operations for 2007 primarily reflected a wind down in the collection of substantially

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet has certain future purchase obligations as to which it has signed contracts. At December
31, 2007, essentially all of AirNet&#146;s Learjet 35 aircraft engines are covered under manufacturer
engine maintenance plans, under which AirNet prepays certain repair and overhaul costs based on a
rate per engine hour.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s Rickenbacker Facility is located on land leased from the Columbus Regional Airport
Authority (the &#147;Authority&#148;). The land lease with the Authority is for an initial term of 20&nbsp;years
which expires in May&nbsp;2025. AirNet may request two additional 10&nbsp;year extensions of the land lease.
In the event the Authority refuses to extend the land lease for either 10&nbsp;year extension period,
the land lease requires the Authority to purchase AirNet&#146;s leasehold improvements under the Federal
Relocation Act. The purchase price of the improvements cannot be less than 50% of the cost of the
leasehold improvements if the Authority refuses to extend the land lease for the first 10&nbsp;year
extension period and cannot be less than 25% of the cost of the leasehold improvements if the
Authority refuses to extend the land lease for the second 10&nbsp;year extension period. Annual rental
payments under the land lease are set at approximately $39,000, $62,000 and $83,000, respectively,
for the first three years of the lease term. Rental payments after the third year of the lease
term are subject to annual increases based upon the consumer price index.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet believes that it currently has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations, including the
payment of capital expenditures and other contractual obligations, from operations, cash on hand
and tax refunds attributable to the accounting method change approved in March&nbsp;2008, as discussed
above. However, to maintain sufficient liquidity as AirNet implements its business strategy and
other strategic initiatives, AirNet may need access to additional or other sources of funding.
AirNet is exploring other financing alternatives which may include sales of aircraft and leasing.
AirNet&#146;s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement currently limits the aggregate amount which
AirNet may pay as expense under operating leases as well as the aggregate amount of assets which
may be the subject of sales transactions or sale and leaseback transactions. The availability and
level of financing sources cannot be assured and the inability of AirNet to obtain additional
funding to AirNet on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on the ability of AirNet
to sustain its operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement expires on October&nbsp;15, 2008 and currently has
no loans outstanding. Although AirNet currently has borrowing availability under the Second
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, management does not expect that AirNet will need to draw
down a significant amount of funds under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for the
foreseeable future. However, if AirNet does need to borrow under the Second Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, adverse operating results in future periods, caused by continuing declines in
Bank Services revenues combined with the high fixed costs of operating its air transportation
network, may cause AirNet to fail to comply with the financial covenants as defined in the Second
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Consequently, unless AirNet is able to obtain a waiver
or amendment from the lender, AirNet would not be able to borrow under the Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement and would have to find alternative sources of liquidity. There can be no
assurance that the lender will agree to any modification, or extension, of the existing Second
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

five-year $20.0&nbsp;million unsecured term loan (collectively, the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;). The revolving
credit facility under the Credit Agreement was originally scheduled to expire on September&nbsp;30, 2005
and the secured term loan was to mature on September&nbsp;30, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;28, 2004, AirNet and its lenders amended the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement
(the &#147;Amended Credit Agreement&#148;). The Amended Credit Agreement was further amended by the First,
Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Change in Terms Agreements, as described below. The Amended Credit
Agreement was secured by a first lien on all of the property of AirNet and its subsidiaries, other
than any interest in real estate and certain excluded fixed assets. AirNet also pledged the stock

revolving loans available under the Amended Credit Agreement was limited to a borrowing base equal
to the aggregate of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 50% of eligible aircraft parts, plus
70% of the market value of certain fixed assets, reduced by the aggregate amount of AirNet&#146;s
outstanding letters of credit. The Amended Credit Agreement bore interest, at AirNet&#146;s option, at
(a)&nbsp;a fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio as defined in
the Amended Credit Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;a floating rate based on the greater of (i)&nbsp;the prime rate
established by The Huntington National Bank from time to time plus a margin
determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio or (ii)&nbsp;the sum of 0.5% plus the federal funds rate in effect
from time to time plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage
ratio.</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
The Amended Credit Facility was amended in September&nbsp;2004, March&nbsp;2005, November&nbsp;2005, March&nbsp;2006
and September&nbsp;2006. The above amendments to the Amended Credit Facility were reflected,
respectively, in the &#147;First Change in Terms Agreement&#148;, the &#147;Second Change in Terms Agreement&#148; ,
the &#147;Third Change in Terms Agreement&#148;, the &#147;Fourth Change in Terms Agreement&#148; and the &#147;Fifth Change
in Terms Agreement&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of the impairment charges recorded by AirNet in September&nbsp;2004, September&nbsp;2005 and
September&nbsp;2006, AirNet was not in compliance with certain terms and conditions of the Amended
Credit Facility, including the fixed charge coverage ratio, the leverage ratio and the minimum
consolidated tangible net worth requirement. The First, Third and Fifth Change in Terms Agreements
modified certain financial covenants contained in the Amended Credit Facility in such a manner
that, on a going-forward basis, the impairment charges, in and of themselves, would not cause a
default of these financial covenants in the future. At the same time that the First, Third and
Fifth Change in Terms Agreements were entered into, AirNet and its lenders executed waivers of any
defaults or potential defaults under the Amended Credit Agreement which occurred, or may have
occurred, as a result of AirNet&#146;s failure to comply with the above financial covenants due to the
various impairment charges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to the amendments made to the Amended Credit Facility to bring the financial covenants
into compliance after the impairment charges recorded in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Amended Credit
Facility was amended on several occasions to modify other terms and conditions of the Amended
Credit Facility. The Second Change in Terms Agreement amended the Amended Credit Facility to
reflect that AirNet had prepaid in full the remaining $11.0&nbsp;million balance outstanding on its
secured term loan. In addition, the Second Change in Terms Agreement reduced the secured revolving
credit facility from $35.0&nbsp;million to $30.0&nbsp;million. The Second Change in Terms Agreement also
extended the term of the Amended Credit Facility from September&nbsp;30, 2005 to October&nbsp;15, 2006. The
Fourth Change in Terms Agreement further extended the term of the Amended Credit Agreement from
October&nbsp;15, 2006 to October&nbsp;15, 2007 and modified the calculation of the borrowing base. The Fifth
Change in Terms Agreement reduced the amount of the secured revolving credit facility from $25
million to $15&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, there was no amount outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet had $1.0&nbsp;million in letters of credit outstanding related to insurance
programs, which reduced the amount available under the revolving credit facility. As of December
31, 2006, AirNet had $14.0&nbsp;million available to borrow under its secured revolving credit facility
under the Amended Credit Agreement.

terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Facility by entering into a Second Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement (the &#147;Second Amended Credit Agreement&#148;). The following description of the Second
Amended Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second Amended Credit
Agreement previously filed as Exhibit&nbsp;4.50 in AirNet&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $15.0&nbsp;million
secured revolving credit facility and expires on October&nbsp;15, 2008. The Second Amended Credit
Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on all of the property of AirNet, other than any
interest in real estate and certain excluded fixed assets. The stock and interests of AirNet&#146;s
subsidiaries continue to be pledged to secure the loans under the Second Amended Credit Agreement,
and each of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries continues to guarantee AirNet&#146;s obligations under the Second
Amended Credit Agreement under a Consent and Agreement of Guarantors.

aggregate amount of up to $10.0&nbsp;million for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing aircraft and
related tangible fixed assets.&nbsp; The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains certain financial
covenants that require AirNet to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and to not
exceed certain fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios specified in the Second Amended Credit
Agreement. The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains limitations on operating leases,
significant corporate changes including mergers and sales of assets, investments in subsidiaries

obligations and hedging transactions.

rate of 8.12%. This term loan was secured by seven Cessna Caravans and nine Learjet 35 aircraft
from AirNet&#146;s cargo aircraft fleet. On April&nbsp;11, 2007, AirNet repaid in full the $7.5&nbsp;million
principal balance outstanding under the term loan with borrowings from AirNet&#146;s Second Amended

$0.1&nbsp;million in accrued interest and early termination prepayment penalties. Upon repayment in

related asset are capitalized as incurred and depreciated based on hours flown. The original cost
of airframes less a salvage value is depreciated based on the straight-line method over the
estimated remaining useful life of the aircraft. Aircraft maintenance costs not meeting AirNet&#146;s
capitalization requirements are expensed as incurred. AirNet uses manufacturer engine maintenance
plans to provide maintenance for recurring inspections and major overhaul maintenance for most of
the engines in its Learjet fleet. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, essentially all of AirNet&#146;s Learjet 35
aircraft engines were covered under manufacturer engine maintenance plans. Under the manufacturer
engine maintenance plans, AirNet pays in advance for certain maintenance, repair and overhaul costs
based on an amount per hour for each hour flown. In October&nbsp;2006, following the write down of a
substantial portion of the prepaid assets related to these engine maintenance plans in connection
with the 2006 asset impairment charge, AirNet changed its estimate of the portion of these payments
that should be capitalized and began expensing approximately 75% of the prepayments, which are
included in aircraft maintenance expense. In 2008, AirNet expects to expense approximately 77% of
the prepayments due to an increase in manufacturer maintenance plan rates. Management estimates
that expensing payments made under manufacturer engine maintenance plans at this rate will maintain
engine book values at the amounts determined to be appropriate as part of the 2006 and 2007 asset
impairment charges. The portion of capitalized prepayments totaled approximately $4.1&nbsp;million and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s operations historically have been somewhat seasonal relative to holidays observed by
financial institutions. When financial institutions are closed on holidays falling on Monday
through Thursday, AirNet&#146;s revenue and net income are adversely affected. AirNet&#146;s fiscal quarter
ending December&nbsp;31 is often the most impacted by bank holidays.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Operating results are also affected by the weather. Winter weather often requires additional costs
for de-icing, hangar rental and other aircraft services. AirNet generally experiences higher
maintenance costs during its fiscal quarter ending March&nbsp;31.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant
judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In
many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. AirNet
maintains a thorough process to review the application of its accounting policies and to evaluate
the appropriateness of the estimates; however, even under optimal circumstances, estimates
routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better
information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either
the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies, and
are material to AirNet&#146;s consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the
development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit
Committee of its Board of Directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Historically, AirNet&#146;s credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because its
credit management processes have been effective. AirNet also recognizes billing adjustments to
revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts, money back service guarantees and billing
corrections.</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
Estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical
experience of bad debts, adjustments processed, current collection and aging trends, and the
individual assessment of customers&#146; credit quality. Once AirNet considers all these factors, a
determination is made as to the appropriate amount of the allowance for uncollectible accounts
receivable. Allowances for these future adjustments aggregated approximately $0.4&nbsp;million and $0.9
million at December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. AirNet considers the sensitivity and
subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate, as changes in economic conditions and pricing
arrangements can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances.

that should be capitalized and began expensing approximately 75% of the prepayments, which are
included in aircraft maintenance expense. In 2008, AirNet expects to expense approximately 77% of
the prepayments due to an increase in manufacturer maintenance plan rates. Management estimates
that expensing payments made under manufacturer engine maintenance plans at this rate will maintain
engine book values at the amounts determined to be appropriate as part of the 2006 and 2007 asset
impairment charges. The portion of capitalized prepayments totaled approximately $4.1&nbsp;million and
$3.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet does not expect to capitalize any significant expenditures made in 2008 related to the
aircraft fleet, with the exception of certain major engine repairs and improvements to engines not
covered by manufacturer engine maintenance plans, and a portion of the prepayments under
manufacturer engine maintenance plans related to the Learjet 35 aircraft. Consequently, the timing
and number of required major aircraft maintenance expenditures can have a significant impact on
AirNet&#146;s results of operations and comparability between periods. As available capacity on
AirNet&#146;s air transportation network permits, AirNet has and will continue to coordinate the timing
of aircraft disposals to permit deferral or elimination of major aircraft maintenance expenditures
and related aircraft maintenance expense. During 2007, AirNet reduced the use of one aircraft
nearing major aircraft maintenance events, which was ultimately sold in February&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Property and Equipment</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s Bank Services and Express Services business are capital intensive. Over 85% of AirNet&#146;s
total assets are invested in flight equipment to serve these markets. AirNet capitalizes those
costs that meet the definition of capital assets under applicable accounting standards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The depreciation or amortization of AirNet&#146;s capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and
the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events.
Because AirNet utilizes many of its capital assets over relatively long periods, management
periodically evaluates whether adjustments to estimated lives or salvage values are necessary. The
accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and,
ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Stock-Based Compensation</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2007, AirNet had two stock-based employee and director compensation plans, the
Amended and Restated 1996 Incentive Stock Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. AirNet accounts
for the plans under SFAS No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), <I>&#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; </I>(&#147;FAS&nbsp;123(R)&#148;), that
addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives
employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that
are based on the fair value of the enterprise&#146;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. FAS 123(R) requires that such transactions be accounted for
using a fair-value-based method and recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Stock-based compensation expense recognized during 2007 and 2006 is based on the value of the
portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 included compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted
prior to, but not yet vested, as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated
in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;148, <I>&#147;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation&#148;</I>. Compensation expense for the stock-based payment awards that are granted subsequent
to December&nbsp;31, 2005 are based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with SFAS&nbsp;No.
123(R). As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of
operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to
vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123(R) requires forfeitures to be
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock options are further detailed in &#147;Note 1 &#150;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, Airnet entered into an agreement with a consultant that provides that AirNet will
issue a warrant to acquire 100,000 common shares of AirNet at an exercise price that is currently
anticipated to be $.10 per common share. Such warrant would not be exercisable for two years after
issuance, subject to earlier exercise upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including a
change of control, a sale of all or substantially all of AirNet&#146;s common shares or assets or a
special dividend in excess of $1.00 per share.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Self-Insurance Accruals</I>
&nbsp;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet is self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers&#146; compensation claims
and benefits paid under employee health care programs. AirNet had total self-insurance accruals of
approximately $0.5&nbsp;million reflected in its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December&nbsp;31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical loss experience and
judgments about the present and expected levels of costs. AirNet accounts for these costs
primarily through measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments based on recent claims
experience. AirNet believes its recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured
on an appropriate basis; however, changes in health costs, loss development factors, accident
frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these
liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Incentive Compensation Plans</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet maintains incentive compensation plans with payouts tied to the achievement of company-wide
earnings goals and personal/departmental goals. Incentive compensation is calculated as a percent
of base pay, depending on participation levels, which vary among management tiers. Costs related
to the company-wide earnings portion of the plans are accrued based on actual quarterly results.
AirNet recorded approximately $1.1&nbsp;million and $1.3&nbsp;million of incentive compensation expense for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet accounts for income taxes under the liability method pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;109. Under the
liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and
laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require AirNet to record a valuation
allowance against future deferred tax assets if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that AirNet will not
be able to utilize such benefits in the future. At December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, AirNet maintained a
valuation allowance of approximately $11.7&nbsp;million and $12.5&nbsp;million, respectively. In 2007 and
2006, the valuation allowance offset deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2007, AirNet adopted FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, <I>&#147;Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes&#148; </I>(&#147;FIN 48&#148;). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute
for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
FIN 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Adoption of FIN 48 did not have an impact on
AirNet&#146;s consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s policy is to recognize interest to be paid on an underpayment of income taxes in interest
expense and any related statutory penalties in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated
statements of operations. AirNet is open to federal and state tax audits until the applicable
statute of limitations expire. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require
several years to complete. AirNet is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations by tax
authorities for tax years before 2003. For the majority of states where AirNet has a significant
presence, it is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2002.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet filed for a discretionary income tax method change with the Internal
Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;). The income tax method change relates to deducting for tax purposes
engine maintenance plan prepayments when paid that were previously deferred and deducted in later
periods. On March&nbsp;11, 2008, AirNet received notice from the IRS of approval for AirNet&#146;s
discretionary income tax method change. As required by SFAS No.&nbsp;109, the effect of the method
change will be reported in the period in which IRS approval is obtained; therefore, AirNet has not
reflected the impact of the method change in the December&nbsp;31, 2007 consolidated financial
statements. AirNet is in the process of evaluating the total impact of the method change; however,
it will materially reduce AirNet&#146;s current taxes payable. Additionally, its deferred tax assets
and the need for the associated valuation allowance could materially change. As a result of the
approval by the IRS for the method change, AirNet has applied for a refund of 2007 federal tax
estimated payments of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million which AirNet expects to receive in 2008.
Additionally, AirNet intends to file an amended tax return for a refund of income taxes previously
paid of approximately $5.6&nbsp;million, the payment of which is subject to review and approval by the
IRS. AirNet expects to receive this refund in 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Impairment of Assets</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144. AirNet
recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate,
in management&#146;s judgment, that AirNet&#146;s assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets. The
carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to estimated fair market value if lower
than carrying value. In determining the estimated fair market value of the assets, AirNet
considers information provided by third party valuation firms retained to assist AirNet in
completing its analysis, published market data and recent transactions involving sales of similar
assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>2007 Asset Impairment Charge</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s cargo airline was originally designed, and continues to operate, primarily to meet the
needs of Bank Services customers. As a result of continuing trends in the implementation of
electronic payment alternatives and electronic
alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks, as of September&nbsp;30, 2007, AirNet
evaluated for impairment its long-lived assets used in its airline operations, consisting primarily
of aircraft, aircraft parts and its airport hangar and office facility located at the Rickenbacker
Facility. The undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets including disposal
values were less than the related carrying values and therefore, pursuant to the requirements of
SFAS No.&nbsp;144, the estimated fair values of these assets were compared to carrying value and the
carrying values were reduced by a $2.2&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge. As a result of AirNet&#146;s
evaluation of the required valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, no tax benefit was
recognized related to this impairment charge as disclosed in &#147;Note 10 &#150; Income Taxes&#148; of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#147;ITEM 8 &#150; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The determination of undiscounted cash flows involves estimates of future cash flows, revenues,
operating expenses and disposal values. The projections of these amounts represent management&#146;s
best estimates at the time of the review. Management&#146;s estimates are significantly affected by the
continuing uncertainty of the timing and rate of decline in Bank Services revenues that are being
impacted by the implementation of electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks and AirNet&#146;s potential to grow other lines of cargo business as alternative sources of
revenues. AirNet will continue to explore cost saving initiatives and alternative sources of
revenue; however, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, until such strategies are
developed, AirNet has assigned minimal probabilities to those strategies in AirNet&#146;s determination
of future undiscounted cash flows. In the absence of additional cost saving initiatives or
alternative sources of revenue, it is likely that future determinations of estimated cash flows
will be less than the carrying value of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets and may result in additional
impairment charges. As a result, AirNet will be required to monitor the carrying value of its
long-lived assets relative to estimated fair values in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The impairment charge was based on a range of estimated fair values provided by third party
appraisal firms. Consistent with how management determined the 2006 asset impairment charge as
described below, and because of the current uncertainties in the business environment, management
determined that the low end of the range of fair values of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets as provided
by the third party appraisal firms was the appropriate estimate of fair value at September&nbsp;30,
2007. Accordingly, the carrying values of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets were reduced by an
approximate $2.2&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge. The determination of the adjusted carrying
value is a management estimate based upon the third party appraisals and the subjective factors
discussed above. It is possible that the proceeds from future sales of assets, if any, could be
greater than or less than current carrying values. Further, if management uses different
assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different
than those anticipated, additional impairment charges may be required.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>2006 Asset Impairment Charge</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet also recorded an impairment charge in the three month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2006.
AirNet performed the impairment tests required by SFAS No.&nbsp;144 for that quarter ended September&nbsp;30,
2006 and concluded that its long-lived assets used in its Delivery Services reportable segment were
impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $24.6&nbsp;million was recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2006.
The impairment charge was based on a range of estimated fair values provided by third party
appraisal firms. The range of appraised fair values related to AirNet&#146;s long lived assets was
approximately $49.7&nbsp;million to $27.7&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2006, reflecting different market
factors, holding periods and possible asset disposition scenarios that potentially could have been
elected by AirNet as it evaluated its strategies in response to the business environment.
Management determined that the low end of the range of fair values was the appropriate estimate of
fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2006, and accordingly, management wrote down the carrying value of
AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets to approximately $27.7&nbsp;million.

&#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
cash flows and shareholders&#146; equity for the years then ended. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item&nbsp;15 (a)&nbsp;2 of the Annual Report of AirNet
Systems, Inc. on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. These financial statements
and schedule are the responsibility of the management of the Company. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We
were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.
Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows the years then ended, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet pays in advance for
certain maintenance, repair and overhaul costs based on an amount per hour for each hour flown. In
October&nbsp;2006, following the write down of a substantial portion of the prepaid assets related to
these engine plans in connection with the 2006 asset impairment charge, AirNet changed its estimate
of the portion of these payments that should be capitalized and began expensing approximately 75%
of the prepayments, which are included in aircraft maintenance expense. In 2008, AirNet expects to
expense approximately 77% of the prepayments due to an increase in manufacturer maintenance plan
rates. Management estimates that expensing payments made under manufacturer engine maintenance
plans at this rate will maintain engine book values at the amounts determined to be appropriate as
part of the 2006 and 2007 asset impairment charges. The portion of capitalized prepayments totaled
approximately $4.1&nbsp;million and $3.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Amortization on these prepaid balances does not begin until major engine overhaul services have

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;144, <I>&#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;). AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets when events or
changes in circumstances indicate, in management&#146;s judgment, that AirNet&#146;s assets might be impaired
and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the
carrying value of those assets. The carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to
estimated fair market value if lower than carrying value. In determining the estimated fair market
value of the assets, AirNet considers information provided by third party valuation firms retained
to assist AirNet in completing its analysis, published market data and recent transactions
involving sales of similar assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Self-Insurance Accruals</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
AirNet is self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers&#146; compensation claims
and benefits paid under employee health care programs. The measurement of these costs requires the
consideration of historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of
costs. AirNet accounts for these costs primarily through measurement of claims outstanding and
projected payments based on recent claims experience. AirNet had total self-insurance accruals of
approximately $0.5&nbsp;million reflected in its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December&nbsp;31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Incentive Compensation Plans</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet maintains an incentive compensation plan with payouts tied to the achievement of
company-wide earnings goals and personal/departmental goals. Incentive compensation is calculated
as a percent of base pay, depending on participation levels, which vary among management tiers.
AirNet accrues for costs related to the personal/departmental goals portion of the plan based on
estimated achievement rates of set goals applied to individuals&#146; base pay rates. AirNet recorded
approximately $1.1&nbsp;million and $1.3&nbsp;million of incentive compensation expense for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet accounts for income taxes under the liability method pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;109, <I>&#147;Accounting
for Income Taxes&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;109&#148;). Under the liability method, deferred tax liabilities and
assets are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to reverse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2007, AirNet adopted FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, <I>&#147;Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes&#148; </I>(&#147;FIN 48&#148;). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute
for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
FIN 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Adoption of FIN 48 did not have an impact on
AirNet&#146;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet filed for a discretionary income tax method change with the Internal

periods. On March&nbsp;11, 2008, AirNet received notice from the IRS of approval for AirNet&#146;s
discretionary income tax method change. As required by SFAS No.&nbsp;109, the effect of the method
change will be reported in the period in which IRS approval is obtained; therefore, AirNet has not
reflected the impact of the method change in the December&nbsp;31, 2007 consolidated financial statements. AirNet is in the process
of evaluating the total impact of the method change; however, it will materially reduce AirNet&#146;s
current taxes payable. Additionally, its deferred tax assets and the need for the associated
valuation allowance could materially change. As a result of the approval by the IRS for the method
change, AirNet has applied for a refund of 2007 federal tax estimated payments of approximately
$1.7&nbsp;million which AirNet expects to receive in 2008. Additionally, AirNet intends to file an
amended tax return for a refund of income taxes previously paid of approximately $5.6&nbsp;million, the
payment of which is subject to review and approval by the IRS. AirNet expects to receive this
refund in 2009.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair value of AirNet&#146;s financial instruments approximated their carrying value at December&nbsp;31,
2007 and 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Stock-Based Compensation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2007, AirNet had two stock-based employee and director compensation plans, the
Amended and Restated 1996 Incentive Stock Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. AirNet accounts
for the plans under SFAS No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), <I>&#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; </I>(&#147;FAS&nbsp;123(R)&#148;), that
addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives
employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that
are based on the fair value of the enterprise&#146;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. FAS 123(R) requires that such transactions be accounted for
using a fair-value-based method and recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Stock-based compensation expense recognized during 2007 and 2006 is based on the value of the
portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 included compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted
prior to, but not yet vested, as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated
in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;148. Compensation expense for the
stock-based payment awards that are granted subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2005 are based on the grant
date fair value estimated in accordance with SFAS&nbsp;123(R). As stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and
2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
SFAS&nbsp;123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary,
in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Currently, AirNet uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock
options granted to employees and directors for purposes of computing the stock-based compensation
expense and disclosures required by FAS 123(R). During 2007 and 2006, AirNet recognized
stock-based compensation expense of approximately $207,000 and $246,000, respectively
(approximately $128,000 and $153,000, net of tax, respectively) related to the vesting of
outstanding stock options according to the provisions of FAS 123(R).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, Airnet entered into an agreement with a consultant that provides that AirNet will
issue a warrant to acquire 100,000 common shares of AirNet at an exercise price that is currently
anticipated to be $.10 per common share. Such warrant would not be exercisable for two years after
issuance, subject to earlier exercise upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including a
change of control, a sale of all or substantially all of AirNet&#146;s common shares or assets or a
special dividend in excess of $1.00 per share.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;issued Statement No.&nbsp;157, <I>&#147;Fair
Value Measurements&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS 157&#148;). SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was expected to be effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. On February&nbsp;12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.
157-2, <I>&#147;Effective Date of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;157&#148; </I>(&#147;FSP&#148;) that amends SFAS 157 to delay the
effective date for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at
least annually). For such items, FSP defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years
beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008. AirNet has evaluated the guidance provided in SFAS 157 and has
determined the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a significant impact on the determination or
reporting of AirNet&#146;s financial results, however, additional disclosures in AirNet&#146;s financial
statements will be required.

planned major maintenance activities in the airline industry. The guidance is applicable for

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144. AirNet
recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate,
in management&#146;s judgment, that AirNet&#146;s assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets. The
carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to estimated fair market value if lower
than carrying value. In determining the estimated fair market value of the assets, AirNet
considers information provided by third party valuation firms retained to assist AirNet in
completing its analysis, published market data and recent transactions involving sales of similar
assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>2007 Asset Impairment Charge</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s cargo airline was originally designed, and continues to operate, primarily to meet the
needs of Bank Services customers. As a result of continuing trends in the implementation of
electronic payment alternatives and electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks, as of September&nbsp;30, 2007, AirNet evaluated for impairment its long-lived assets used in its
airline operations, consisting primarily of aircraft, aircraft parts and its airport hangar and
office facility located at Rickenbacker International Airport (the &#147;Rickenbacker Facility&#148;). The
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets including disposal values were
less than the related carrying values and therefore, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;144,
the estimated fair values of these assets were compared to carrying value and the carrying values
were reduced by a $2.2&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge. As a result of AirNet&#146;s evaluation of
the required valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, no tax benefit was recognized related to
this impairment charge as disclosed in Note 10, Income Taxes, below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The determination of undiscounted cash flows involves estimates of future cash flows, revenues,
operating expenses and disposal values. The projections of these amounts represent management&#146;s
best estimates at the time of the review. Management&#146;s estimates are significantly affected by the
continuing uncertainty of the timing and rate of decline in Bank Services revenues that are being
impacted by the implementation of electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks and AirNet&#146;s potential to grow other lines of cargo business as alternative sources of
revenues. AirNet will continue to explore cost saving initiatives and alternative sources of
revenue; however, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, until such strategies are
developed, AirNet has assigned minimal probabilities to those strategies in AirNet&#146;s determination
of future undiscounted cash flows. In the absence of additional cost saving initiatives or
alternative sources of revenue, it is likely that future determinations of estimated cash flows
will be less than the carrying value of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets and may result in additional
impairment charges. As a result, AirNet will be required to monitor the carrying value of its
long-lived assets relative to estimated fair values in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The impairment charge was based on a range of estimated fair values provided by third party
appraisal firms. Consistent with how management determined the 2006 asset impairment charge as
described below, and because of the current uncertainties in the business environment, management
determined that the low end of the range of fair values of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets as provided
by the third party appraisal firms was the appropriate estimate of fair value at September&nbsp;30,
2007. Accordingly, the carrying values of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets were reduced by an
approximate $2.2&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge. The determination of the adjusted carrying
value is a management estimate based upon the third party appraisals and the subjective factors
discussed above. It is possible that the proceeds from future sales of assets, if any, could be
greater than or less than current carrying values. Further, if management uses different
assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different
than those anticipated, additional impairment charges may be required.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet also recorded an impairment charge in the three month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2006.
AirNet performed the impairment tests required by SFAS No.&nbsp;144 for that quarter ended September&nbsp;30,
2006 and concluded that its long-lived assets used in its Delivery Services reportable segment were
impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $24.6&nbsp;million was recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2006.
The impairment charge was based on a range of estimated fair values provided by third party
appraisal firms. The range of appraised fair values related to AirNet&#146;s long lived assets was
approximately $49.7&nbsp;million to $27.7&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2006, reflecting different market
factors, holding periods and possible asset disposition scenarios that potentially could have been
elected by AirNet as it evaluated its strategies in response to the business environment.
Management determined that the low end of the range of fair values was the appropriate estimate of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet depends on certain major Bank Services customers for a large portion of its net revenues and
changes in the pricing and extent of services provided to these customers may have a significant
impact on AirNet&#146;s operating results. If a major Bank Services customer significantly reduces the
amount of business it does with AirNet, there would be an adverse impact on AirNet&#146;s operating
results. For 2007 and 2006, AirNet had five Bank Services customers that aggregated approximately
39% and 40% of total net revenues, respectively. One Bank Services customer comprised
approximately 11% of total net revenues in 2007 while two Bank Services customers comprised 11% and
10% of total net revenues in 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2008, AirNet received written notices from one of its largest bank customers that this
customer will be terminating a portion of the air transportation services provided by AirNet due to
cost reduction efforts by the bank. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, the air
transportation services being terminated by this customer accounted for approximately $4.9&nbsp;million
of AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues (including approximately $0.8&nbsp;million of fuel surcharge
revenues). The service terminations are scheduled to become effective at various dates in the
second quarter of 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of Bank Services customers continued transition to image products and other electronic
alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks, weekday cancelled check pounds shipped
per flying day declined approximately 31%, for 2007 compared to 2006. AirNet expects the decline
in cancelled checks volume to continue in 2008 and thereafter.

agreement regarding the sale of Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business to Pinnacle. The sale was
completed on September&nbsp;26, 2006. The purchase price was $41.0&nbsp;million in cash, of which $40.0
million was consideration for the sale of nine company-owned aircraft and related engine
maintenance programs and $1.0&nbsp;million was consideration for the sale of all of the outstanding
capital stock of a newly-created subsidiary of Jetride. Of the total consideration, $40.0&nbsp;million
was paid at closing and $1.0&nbsp;million was paid into escrow to cover potential indemnification claims
made by Pinnacle. Since no indemnification claims were made, the escrow amount was released to
AirNet in two installments of $500,000 each in March&nbsp;2007 and August&nbsp;2007. AirNet retained the net
working capital of the Jetride passenger charter business, which was approximately $2.2&nbsp;million as
of the closing date. In connection with the closing of the sale transaction, Jetride repaid in
full six term loans which had been secured by aircraft used in Jetride&#146;s passenger charter
business. The aggregate principal amount of the loans repaid was approximately $28.2&nbsp;million plus
accrued interest and early termination prepayment penalties of approximately $0.3&nbsp;million through
the repayment date. Following repayment of Jetride&#146;s loans and expenses related to the
transaction, AirNet used the remaining sale proceeds to further reduce debt outstanding under
AirNet&#146;s secured revolving credit facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, AirNet classified the assets and liabilities of Passenger Charter
Services as assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations and presented this operating
segment&#146;s results of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As a result
of the disposition of Passenger Charter Services, AirNet has only one reportable segment.

taxes is a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, which is net of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million
of investment banking and legal fees associated with the sale of Jetride.

</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2002, AirNet entered into a $35.0&nbsp;million unsecured revolving credit facility and a
five-year $20.0&nbsp;million unsecured term loan (collectively, the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;). The revolving
credit facility under the Credit Agreement was originally scheduled to expire on September&nbsp;30, 2005
and the secured term loan was to mature on September&nbsp;30, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;28, 2004, AirNet and its lenders amended the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement
(the &#147;Amended Credit Agreement&#148;). The Amended Credit Agreement was further amended by the First,
Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Change in Terms Agreements, as described below. The Amended Credit
Agreement was secured by a first lien on all of the
property of AirNet and its subsidiaries, other than any interest in real estate and certain
excluded fixed assets. AirNet also pledged the stock and interests of its subsidiaries to secure
the loans under the Amended Credit Agreement, and each of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries guaranteed AirNet&#146;s
obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement also contained
certain financial covenants that required AirNet to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net
worth and to not exceed certain fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios specified in the Amended
Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Amended Credit Agreement initially provided for a secured revolving credit facility of up to
$35.0&nbsp;million and a secured term loan in the aggregate amount of $14.0&nbsp;million. The amount of
revolving loans available under the Amended Credit Agreement was limited to a borrowing base equal
to the aggregate of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 50% of eligible aircraft parts, plus
70% of the market value of certain fixed assets, reduced by the aggregate amount of AirNet&#146;s
outstanding letters of credit. The Amended Credit Agreement bore interest, at AirNet&#146;s option, at
(a)&nbsp;a fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio as defined in
the Amended Credit Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;a floating rate based on the greater of (i)&nbsp;the prime rate
established by The Huntington National Bank from time to time plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s
leverage ratio or (ii)&nbsp;the sum of 0.5% plus the federal funds rate in effect from time to time plus
a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Amended Credit Facility was amended in September&nbsp;2004, March&nbsp;2005, November&nbsp;2005, March&nbsp;2006
and September&nbsp;2006. The above amendments to the Amended Credit Facility were reflected,
respectively, in the &#147;First Change in Terms Agreement&#148;, the &#147;Second Change in Terms Agreement&#148; ,
the &#147;Third Change in Terms Agreement&#148;, the &#147;Fourth Change in Terms Agreement&#148; and the &#147;Fifth Change
in Terms Agreement&#148;.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of the impairment charges recorded by AirNet in September&nbsp;2004, September&nbsp;2005 and
September&nbsp;2006, AirNet was not in compliance with certain terms and conditions of the Amended
Credit Facility, including the fixed charge coverage ratio, the leverage ratio and the minimum
consolidated tangible net worth requirement. The First, Third and Fifth Change in Terms Agreements
modified certain financial covenants contained in the Amended Credit Facility in such a manner
that, on a going-forward basis, the impairment charges, in and of themselves, would not cause a
default of these financial covenants in the future. At the same time that the First, Third and
Fifth Change in Terms Agreements were entered into, AirNet and its lenders executed waivers of any
defaults or potential defaults under the Amended Credit Agreement which occurred, or may have
occurred, as a result of AirNet&#146;s failure to comply with the above financial covenants due to the
various impairment charges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to the amendments made to the Amended Credit Facility to bring the financial covenants
into compliance after the impairment charges recorded in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Amended Credit
Facility was amended on several occasions to modify other terms and conditions of the Amended
Credit Facility. The Second Change in Terms Agreement amended the Amended Credit Facility to
reflect that AirNet had prepaid in full the remaining $11.0&nbsp;million balance outstanding on its
secured term loan. In addition, the Second Change in Terms Agreement reduced the secured revolving
credit facility from $35.0&nbsp;million to $30.0&nbsp;million. The Second Change in Terms Agreement also
extended the term of the Amended Credit Facility from September&nbsp;30, 2005 to October&nbsp;15, 2006. The
Fourth Change in Terms Agreement further extended the term of the Amended Credit Agreement from
October&nbsp;15, 2006 to October&nbsp;15, 2007 and modified the calculation of the borrowing base. The Fifth
Change in Terms Agreement reduced the amount of the secured revolving credit facility from $25
million to $15&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, there was no amount outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet had $1.0&nbsp;million in letters of credit outstanding related to insurance
programs, which reduced the amount available under the revolving credit facility. As of December
31, 2006, AirNet had $14.0&nbsp;million available to borrow under its secured revolving credit facility
under the Amended Credit Agreement.

Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on all of the property of AirNet,
other than any interest in real estate and certain excluded fixed assets. The stock and interests

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Second Amended Credit Agreement permits AirNet to maintain and incur other indebtedness in an
aggregate amount of up to $10.0&nbsp;million for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing aircraft and
related tangible fixed assets. The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains certain financial
covenants that require AirNet to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and to not
exceed certain fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios specified in the Second Amended Credit
Agreement. The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains limitations on operating leases,
significant corporate changes including mergers and sales of assets, investments in subsidiaries
and acquisitions, liens, capital expenditures, transactions with affiliates, sales of accounts
receivable, sale and leaseback transactions and other off-balance sheet liabilities, contingent
obligations and hedging transactions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, there were no loans outstanding under the Second Amended Credit Agreement.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, AirNet had approximately $0.8&nbsp;million in standby letters of credit
outstanding related to insurance programs, which reduced the amount available to borrow to
approximately $14.2&nbsp;million under the Second Amended Credit Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;24, 2005, AirNet entered into an $11.0&nbsp;million three-year term loan with a fixed interest
rate of 8.12%. This term loan was secured by seven Cessna Caravans and nine Learjet 35 aircraft
from AirNet&#146;s cargo aircraft fleet. On April&nbsp;11, 2007, AirNet repaid in full the $7.5&nbsp;million
principal balance outstanding under the term loan with borrowings from AirNet&#146;s Second Amended
Credit Agreement. In addition to the outstanding principal amount, AirNet paid approximately $0.1
million in accrued interest and early termination prepayment penalties. Upon repayment in full,
the term loan was terminated in accordance with its terms.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the closing of the sale of the Jetride passenger charter business on September
26, 2006, Jetride repaid in full six term loans which had been (a)&nbsp;secured by aircraft used in the
Jetride passenger charter business, and (b)&nbsp;guaranteed by AirNet. In June&nbsp;2004, Jetride entered
into four of the term loans, each with a seven-year term and a fixed interest rate of approximately
6.7%. In July&nbsp;2004, Jetride entered into the other two term loans, each with a seven-year term and
a fixed interest rate of approximately 6.5%. As of September&nbsp;26, 2006, there was an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $28.2&nbsp;million outstanding under the six loans. In addition to
the outstanding principal amount, Jetride paid approximately $0.3&nbsp;million in accrued interest and
early termination prepayment penalties through the repayment date. Each of the loan documents and
corresponding security and guaranty agreements entered into in connection with the six term loans
was terminated upon repayment of the underlying term loans at the closing.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;4, 2004, the shareholders of AirNet Systems, Inc. approved the AirNet Systems, Inc. 2004
Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;2004 Plan&#148;), for employees of AirNet and its subsidiaries and
non-employee directors of AirNet. The 2004 Plan authorizes the granting of incentive and
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and performance shares to
be paid in common shares and performance units to be paid in cash (collectively, &#147;2004 Plan
Awards&#148;). In addition, the 2004 Plan provides for the granting of rights to purchase common shares
of AirNet at up to a 15% discount through payroll deductions by employees of AirNet and its
subsidiaries (the &#147;2004 Stock Purchase Program&#148;). The maximum number of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">common shares available for issuance under the 2004 Plan is 1,000,000. The
2004 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which determines
the terms and conditions applicable to the 2004 Plan Awards, other than non-qualified stock options
automatically granted to non-employee directors of AirNet in accordance with the terms of the 2004
Plan. The Compensation Committee also has the authority to establish administrative rules and
regulations regarding the term of each offering under the 2004 Stock Purchase Plan. In December
2006, non-qualified stock options covering 150,000 common shares were granted to Bruce D. Parker,
AirNet&#146;s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President under the terms of an
employment contract. In September&nbsp;2007, non-qualified stock options covering 20,000 common shares
were automatically granted under the terms of the 2004 Plan to each of Messrs.&nbsp;Kiernan and
Milbourne as new directors of AirNet. The exercise price of each option has been equal to the fair
market price of a common share on the date of grant. An option&#146;s maximum term is ten years.
Option vesting periods range from vesting upon grant to vesting over four years. In 2007 and 2006,
10,691 and 16,547 common shares, respectively, were issued under the 2004 Stock Purchase Program to
employees of AirNet and its subsidiaries.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 1996, AirNet adopted the AirNet Systems, Inc. 1996 Incentive Stock Plan (as amended and
restated, the &#147;1996 Plan&#148;). The 1996 Plan authorized the granting of incentive and non-qualified
stock options, restricted stock and performance awards (collectively, &#147;1996 Plan Awards&#148;). In
addition, the 1996 Plan provided for the granting of rights to purchase common shares of AirNet at
up to a 15% discount through payroll deductions by employees of AirNet and its subsidiaries (the
&#147;1996 Stock Purchase Program&#148;). The 1996 Plan also provided for the grant of non-qualified stock
options to non-employee directors of AirNet. The maximum number of common shares available for
issuance under the 1996 Plan is 1,650,000. The 1996 Plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the AirNet Board of Directors, which determined the terms and conditions applicable to
the 1996 Plan Awards, other than non-qualified stock options automatically granted to non-employee
directors in accordance with the terms of the 1996 Plan. The exercise price of each option has
been equal to the fair market price of a common share on the date of grant. An option&#146;s maximum
term is ten years. Option vesting periods range from vesting upon grant to vesting over four
years. Since the adoption of the 2004 Plan, no additional 1996 Plan Awards have been or will be
made under the 1996 Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s stock purchase program, which had been part of the 1996 Plan and is part of the 2004 Plan,
allows eligible employees the opportunity to acquire common shares of AirNet at up to a 15%
discount through payroll deductions. AirNet issued 10,691 and 16,547 common shares respectively
during 2007 and 2006 from treasury shares under the stock purchase program.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet leases facility space and courier vehicles at various locations throughout the United
States. In January&nbsp;2002, AirNet entered into operating leases for six Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft,
which after certain extensions entered into in September&nbsp;2002, terminated in 2006 and 2007. In
January of 2003 and January of 2006, AirNet entered into two additional operating leases on Cessna
Caravan 208 aircraft that expire, respectively, in 2007 and 2008. In February&nbsp;2006, AirNet entered
into a one-year operating lease on an additional Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft. In August and
October&nbsp;2007, AirNet entered into two additional operating leases on Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft
that expire in 2008. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, AirNet maintained leases on nine Cessna Caravan 208
aircraft, three of which are scheduled to expire in 2009, four of which are scheduled to expire in
2010 and two of which are scheduled to expire in 2011
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s corporate and operational facility (the &#147;Rickenbacker Facility&#148;) is located on land leased
from the Columbus Regional Airport Authority (the &#147;Authority&#148;). The land lease with the Authority
is for an initial term of 20&nbsp;years which expires in May&nbsp;2025. AirNet may request two additional 10
year extensions of the land lease. In the event the Authority refuses to extend the land lease for
either 10&nbsp;year extension period, the land lease requires the Authority to purchase AirNet&#146;s
leasehold improvements under the Federal Relocation Act. The purchase price of the improvements
cannot be less than 50% of the cost of the leasehold improvements if the Authority refuses to
extend the land lease for the first 10&nbsp;year extension period and cannot be less than 25% of the
cost of the leasehold improvements if the Authority refuses to extend the land lease for the second
10&nbsp;year extension period. Annual rental payments under the land lease are set at approximately
$39,000, $62,000 and $83,000, respectively, for the first three years of the lease term. Rental
payments after the third year of the lease term are subject to annual increases based upon the
consumer price index.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet incurred lease expense of $2,890,000 and $2,810,000 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007
and 2006. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, future minimum lease payments by year under non-cancelable
operating leases with initial or remaining terms exceeding one year are as follows: 2008 -
$873,000; 2009 &#151; $217,000; 2010 &#151; $91,000; 2011 &#151; $93,000; 2012 &#151; $96,000. During the first
quarter of 2008, AirNet extended the terms of a portion of the aircraft leases, increasing its
commitments by $1,653,000 over the remaining terms.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet has a 401(k) retirement savings plan. All associates who have completed a minimum of one
month of service may contribute up to 60% of their eligible annual earnings to the 401(k)
retirement savings plan, subject to the maximum limitation imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.
AirNet may elect, at its discretion, to make matching and profit-
sharing contributions. AirNet&#146;s contribution expense related to the 401(k) retirement savings plan
for continuing operations totaled $316,000 and $376,000 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2006, AirNet decided to market for sale all nine of the Cessna 310 Piston cargo
aircraft as a result of the need to reduce its airline capacity and operating costs. At that date,
AirNet determined that the plan of sale criteria of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 had been met. The carrying value
of the assets was determined to approximate the estimated fair value less cost to sell, based on
then recent aircraft appraisals. In November&nbsp;2006, AirNet entered into an agreement to sell all
nine of its Cessna 310 aircraft for approximately $0.5&nbsp;million. AirNet delivered seven aircraft in
the first quarter of 2007 and delivered the two remaining aircraft in June&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;10, 2007, one of AirNet&#146;s Learjets was damaged and subsequently declared not airworthy.
AirNet received insurance proceeds of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million on April&nbsp;19, 2007 related to this
loss. The gain on disposition of aircraft primarily reflects the excess of insurance proceeds over
the net book value of this Learjet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2008, as a part of a planned cost reduction, AirNet entered into an agreement to sell
one of its Learjet aircraft for approximately $0.5&nbsp;million. AirNet delivered the aircraft in the
first quarter of 2008. Additionally, in February&nbsp;2008, a Learjet aircraft was damaged by another
air operator&#146;s baggage tug and subsequently removed from AirNet&#146;s aircraft fleet. As of the date
of AirNet&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, AirNet has not determined a final disposition with regard
to such damaged aircraft.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require AirNet to record a valuation
allowance against future deferred tax assets if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that AirNet will not
be able to utilize such benefits in the future. At December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, AirNet maintained a
valuation allowance of approximately $11.7&nbsp;million and $12.5&nbsp;million, respectively. In 2007 and
2006, the valuation allowance offset deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities.
The change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was approximately $0.8&nbsp;million in
2007 and approximately $6.2&nbsp;million in 2006. Of the approximate $0.8&nbsp;million change in the
valuation allowance in 2007, approximately $0.2&nbsp;million impacted earnings and approximately $0.6
million was the result of adjustments to decrease certain deferred tax assets, resulting in
corresponding decreases in the valuation allowance and no impact on 2007 earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet filed for a discretionary income tax method change with the IRS. The
income tax method change relates to deducting for tax purposes engine maintenance plan prepayments
when paid that were previously deferred and deducted in later periods. On March&nbsp;11, 2008, AirNet
received notice from the IRS of approval for AirNet&#146;s discretionary income tax method change. As
required by SFAS No.&nbsp;109, the effect of the method change will be reported in the period in which
IRS approval is obtained; therefore, AirNet has not reflected the impact of the method change in
the December&nbsp;31, 2007 consolidated financial statements. AirNet is in the process of evaluating
the total impact of the method change; however, it will materially reduce AirNet&#146;s current taxes
payable. Additionally, its deferred tax assets and the need for the associated valuation allowance
could materially change. As a result of the approval by the IRS for the method change, AirNet has
applied for a refund of 2007 federal tax estimated payments of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million which
AirNet expects to receive in 2008. Additionally, AirNet intends to file an amended tax return for
a refund of income taxes previously paid of approximately $5.6&nbsp;million, the payment of which is
subject to review and approval by the IRS. AirNet expects to receive this refund in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the 1996 repurchase and cancellation of the Donald Wright Warrant, AirNet
recognized a related tax benefit estimated to be $7.0&nbsp;million based upon management&#146;s judgment and
estimation of the portion of the Donald Wright Warrant which would be deductible for income tax
purposes. This tax benefit was recognized as additional paid-in capital on AirNet&#146;s Consolidated
Balance Sheet and has had no effect on AirNet&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the
third quarter of 2003, this matter was partially resolved and in the fourth quarter of 2006, was
finalized. AirNet has realized tax deductions related to this transaction in excess of
management&#146;s original estimates resulting in additional tax benefits. The additional tax benefits
associated with the deductible portion of the Donald Wright Warrant have exceeded the original
estimate by $1.3&nbsp;million in 2003 and $0.6&nbsp;million in 2006. The additional tax benefits, as was the
initial estimated tax benefit associated with the Donald Wright Warrant, have been recorded as an
increase to additional paid-in capital.

management, the outcomes of these actions, which are not clearly determinable at the present time,

affiliate of Bayside Capital, Inc. (&#147;Bayside Capital&#148;) for $2.81 per share in a cash merger
transaction. The price represents a premium of approximately 94% over the closing price of $1.45
per share on March&nbsp;28, 2008. The total value of the transaction in the merger is approximately
$28.7&nbsp;million (before transaction costs). In conjunction with the merger agreement, the affiliate of Bayside Capital will
also be purchasing approximately 1.9&nbsp;million common shares of AirNet at $2.81 for a total purchase price of
approximately $5.4 million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Board of Directors of AirNet unanimously approved the merger agreement, determined that the
merger is in the best interests of AirNet&#146;s shareholders and agreed to recommend approval and
adoption of the merger and the merger agreement by AirNet&#146;s shareholders. AirNet&#146;s shareholders
will vote on the proposed merger at a special meeting that will be held on a date to be announced.
Completion of the merger is subject to various customary closing conditions, including shareholder
approval and adoption of the merger and the merger agreement and the obtaining of any required
regulatory approvals. The closing of the merger is expected to occur during the second quarter of
2008, and is not subject to any financing contingencies. However, there can be no assurances that
the parties will be able to obtain any required regulatory approvals of the merger on the proposed
terms and schedule, that AirNet&#146;s shareholders will approve and adopt the merger and the merger
agreement or that the other closing conditions will be satisfied. Additionally, uncertainty
surrounding the proposed merger may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with AirNet&#146;s
customers and team members. In the event that the

(&#147;MergeGlobal&#148;). Pursuant to this amended letter agreement, AirNet expanded the initial engagement
of MergeGlobal and authorized MergeGlobal to develop in greater detail a business strategy and
plan. AirNet had previously engaged MergeGlobal on August&nbsp;17, 2007 to provide initial strategic
and financial advice in connection with AirNet&#146;s business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pursuant to the original letter agreement, AirNet paid MergeGlobal a retainer fee of $150,000 and
agreed to pay MergeGlobal certain success and/or financing fees if an acquisition transaction
involving a specified list of companies were to be pursued and completed. To date, no such fees
have been incurred or paid. Pursuant to the amended letter agreement, AirNet agreed to pay
MergeGlobal an additional $150,000 in three installments between December&nbsp;3, 2007 and the later of
February&nbsp;15, 2008 or upon delivery by MergeGlobal of all of the planned work under the amended
letter agreement. In addition, upon completion of the planned work, the amended letter agreement
provides that AirNet will issue MergeGlobal a warrant to acquire 100,000 common shares of AirNet at
an exercise price that is currently anticipated to be $.10 per common share. Such warrant would
not be exercisable for two years after issuance, subject to earlier exercise upon the occurrence of
certain triggering events, including a change of control, a sale of all or substantially all of
AirNet&#146;s common shares or assets or a special dividend in excess of $1.00 per share.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Payments under the 2007 Incentive Plan were based on a combination of AirNet&#146;s (i)&nbsp;pre-tax income
for the 2007 fiscal year, (ii)&nbsp;Express Services revenues and contribution margins for the 2007
fiscal year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal goals assigned to each participant. The
Compensation Committee determined the personal goals of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief
Executive Officer determines the personal goals for the other executive officers, which were
reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. The personal goals of other participants were
approved by the Chief
Executive Officer and reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The personal goals approved by the
Compensation Committee for each of the executive officers related to specific business objectives

potential allocated to his personal goals without regard to AirNet&#146;s attainment of its financial
objectives. Once the designated threshold level of pre-tax income was achieved, potential
incentive compensation payouts were to increase at predetermined levels until the maximum incentive

Incentive Compensation Plan (i)&nbsp;pre-tax income for the 2007 fiscal year; (ii)&nbsp;Express Services
revenues and contribution margins for the 2007 fiscal year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal
goals. With the exception of Mr.&nbsp;Parker, 20% of each participant&#146;s incentive compensation payout
was allocated to the attainment of personal goals. Forty percent of Mr.&nbsp;Parker&#146;s incentive
compensation payment was allocated to the attainment of personal goals. The portion of each
participant&#146;s incentive compensation potential that was not allocated to the attainment of personal
goals was to be allocated to the attainment of predetermined levels of pre-tax income and Express
Services revenues and contribution margin based upon such participant&#146;s responsibility for
achieving such goals.

Vice President, Express Services), Jeffery B. Harris (Senior Vice President, Bank Services), Ray L.
Druseikis (Vice President of Finance and Controller and Principal Accounting Officer; Interim Chief
Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary) and Craig A. Leach (Vice President, Information

Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were 37 participants in the 2008 Incentive Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The targeted incentive compensation payment a participant may earn under the 2008 Incentive Plan
ranges from 20% to 100% of the participant&#146;s base salary, depending upon such participant&#146;s level
of responsibility for achieving AirNet&#146;s goals for the 2008 fiscal year. The targeted percentage of
annual base salary that each of AirNet&#146;s executive officers may earn as incentive compensation
under the 2008 Incentive Plan is as follows: Bruce D. Parker, 100%; Larry M. Glasscock, Jr.,
Jeffery B. Harris, 75%; Ray L. Druseikis and Craig A. Leach, 50%.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Payments under the 2008 Incentive Plan will be based on a combination of AirNet&#146;s (i)&nbsp;pre-tax
income for the 2008 fiscal year, (ii)&nbsp;Express Services contribution margins for the 2008 fiscal
year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal goals assigned to each participant. The Compensation
Committee determines the personal goals of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive
Officer determines the personal goals for the other executive officers, which are reviewed and
approved by the Compensation Committee. The personal goals of other participants are approved by
the Chief Executive Officer and are reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The personal goals
approved by the Compensation Committee for each of the executive officers relate to specific
business objectives with respect to general business operations (e.g., regulatory compliance,
expense reductions, etc.) and each business segment (e.g., execution of specific contracts with
customers and vendors, cost reductions, service improvements, etc.).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">With the exception of Mr.&nbsp;Parker, no incentive compensation will be paid under the 2008 Incentive
Plan unless AirNet achieves at least 80% of its targeted pre-tax income for the 2008 fiscal year.
Once this designated threshold level of pre-tax income is achieved, potential incentive
compensation payouts will increase at predetermined levels until the maximum incentive compensation
payout is reached at approximately 143% of AirNet&#146;s targeted pre-tax income for the 2008 fiscal
year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Once the aggregate potential incentive compensation payout is determined based upon the level of
pre-tax income achieved by AirNet during the 2008 fiscal year, each participant&#146;s incentive
compensation payment will be determined based upon the following three components of the 2008
Incentive Compensation Plan (i)&nbsp;pre-tax income for the 2008 fiscal year; (ii)&nbsp;Express Services
contribution margins for the 2008 fiscal year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal goals. Twenty
percent of each participant&#146;s incentive compensation payout is allocated to the attainment of
personal goals. The portion of each participant&#146;s incentive compensation potential that is not
allocated to the attainment of personal goals will be allocated to the attainment of predetermined
levels of pre-tax income and Express Services contribution margin based upon such participant&#146;s
responsibility for achieving such goals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">No incentive compensation will be earned with respect to the Express Services component of the 2008
Incentive Plan unless AirNet achieves at least 100% of its targeted Express Services contribution
margin. Once the designated threshold level of Express Services contribution margin is achieved,
potential incentive compensation payouts under the Express Services component of the 2008 Incentive
Plan will increase at predetermined levels until the maximum Express Services compensation payout
level is achieved.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Mr.&nbsp;Parker&#146;s incentive compensation payments under the 2008 Incentive Plan will be based upon the

eligible to receive up to 50% of his annual base salary in each six-month period, subject to the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Effective May&nbsp;27, 1998, AirNet established the AirNet Systems, Inc. Director Deferred Compensation
Plan (the &#147;Director Deferred Plan&#148;). The Director Deferred Plan as in effect on March&nbsp;31, 2008 has
previously been filed as Exhibit&nbsp;10.7 to AirNet&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. Voluntary participation in the Director Deferred Plan enables a
Non-Employee Director of AirNet to defer all or a part of his director&#146;s fees, including federal
income tax thereon. Such deferred fees may be credited to (i)&nbsp;a cash account where the funds will
earn interest at the rate prescribed in the Director Deferred Plan, or (ii)&nbsp;a stock account where
the funds will be converted into a common share equivalent (determined by dividing the amount to be
allocated to the Non-Employee Director&#146;s stock account by the fair market value of AirNet&#146;s common
shares when the credit to the stock account is made). In his deferral election, a Non-Employee
Director may elect whether distribution of the amount in his account(s) under the Director Deferred
Plan is to be made in a single lump sum payment or in equal annual installments, payable over a
period of not more than ten years. Distributions are to commence within 30&nbsp;days of the earlier of
(a)&nbsp;the date specified by a Non-Employee Director at the time a deferral election is made or (b)

Exhibit&nbsp;10.1 to AirNet&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003.
On March&nbsp;7, 1997, each individual then serving as a Non-Employee Director was automatically granted
an immediately exercisable option to purchase 2,000 AirNet common shares with an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of the common shares on the grant date. On August&nbsp;19, 1998, each
individual then serving as a Non-Employee Director was automatically granted an option to purchase
20,000 AirNet common shares with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common
shares on the grant date. Each option granted on August&nbsp;19, 1998 vested and became exercisable
with respect to 20% of the common shares covered thereby on each of the grant date and the first,

individual who was then serving as a Non-Employee Director and had served for at least one full
one-year term as a Non-Employee Director, was automatically granted an option to purchase 4,000
AirNet common shares. All of these options were granted with an exercise price per share equal to
the fair market value of the common shares on the respective grant date. In addition, all of these
options vested and became exercisable with respect to 20% of the common shares covered thereby on
each of the grant date and the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date.

period of three months (12&nbsp;months in the case of a Non-Employee Director who becomes disabled or
dies) after the date his service ends, subject in each case to the stated term of each option.
However, a Non-Employee Director who ceases to be a director after having been convicted of, or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Participants in the 2007 Incentive Plan included AirNet&#146;s executive officers &#150; Bruce D. Parker
(Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President), Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. (Senior
Vice President, Express Services), Jeffery B. Harris (Senior Vice President, Bank Services), Ray L.
Druseikis (Vice President of Finance and Controller and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer
and Secretary) and Craig A. Leach (Vice President, Information Systems) &#151; and certain department
managers and department directors. There were 37 participants in the 2007 Incentive Plan who
received payments under its terms.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The targeted incentive compensation payment a participant could have earned under the 2007
Incentive Plan ranged from 20% to 100% of the participant&#146;s base salary, depending upon such
participant&#146;s level of responsibility for achieving AirNet&#146;s goals for the 2007 fiscal year. The
targeted percentage of annual base salary that each of AirNet&#146;s executive officers could have
earned as incentive compensation under the 2007 Incentive Plan was as follows: Bruce D. Parker,
100%; Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. and Jeffery B. Harris, 75%; and Ray L. Druseikis and Craig A. Leach,
50%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Payments under the 2007 Incentive Plan were based on a combination of AirNet&#146;s (i)&nbsp;pre-tax income
for the 2007 fiscal year, (ii)&nbsp;Express Services revenues and contribution margins for the 2007
fiscal year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal goals assigned to each participant. The
Compensation Committee determined the personal goals of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief
Executive Officer determines the personal goals for the other executive officers, which were
reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. The personal goals of other participants were
approved by the Chief Executive Officer and reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The personal
goals approved by the Compensation Committee for each of the executive officers related to specific
business objectives with respect to general business operations (e.g., regulatory compliance,
expense reductions, etc.) and each business segment (e.g., execution of specific contracts with
customers and vendors, cost reductions, service improvements, etc.).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">With the exception of Bruce D. Parker, no incentive compensation was to be paid under the 2007
Incentive Plan unless AirNet achieved at least 80% of its targeted pre-tax income for the 2007
fiscal year. Mr.&nbsp;Parker was eligible to receive the portion of his incentive compensation
potential allocated to his personal goals without regard to AirNet&#146;s attainment of its financial
objectives. Once the designated threshold level of pre-tax income was achieved, potential
incentive compensation payouts were to increase at predetermined levels until the maximum incentive
compensation payout of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million was reached at approximately 140% of AirNet&#146;s
targeted pre-tax income for the 2007 fiscal year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Once the aggregate potential incentive compensation payout is determined based upon the level of
pre-tax income achieved by AirNet during the 2007 fiscal year, each participant&#146;s incentive
compensation payment was to be determined based upon the following three components of the 2007
Incentive Compensation Plan (i)&nbsp;pre-tax income for the 2007 fiscal year; (ii)&nbsp;Express Services
revenues and contribution margins for the 2007 fiscal year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal
goals. With the exception of Mr.&nbsp;Parker, 20% of each participant&#146;s incentive compensation payout
was allocated to the attainment of personal goals. Forty percent of Mr.&nbsp;Parker&#146;s incentive
compensation payment was allocated to the attainment of personal goals. The portion of each
participant&#146;s incentive compensation potential that was not allocated to the attainment of personal
goals was to be allocated to the attainment of predetermined levels of pre-tax income and Express
Services revenues and contribution margin based upon such participant&#146;s responsibility for
achieving such goals.

of AirNet for the 2007 fiscal year, the $2.2&nbsp;million non-cash
impairment charge recorded by AirNet in the third quarter of the 2007
fiscal year would be disregarded and AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income for the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;29, 2008, the Board of Directors of AirNet, upon the recommendation of the Compensation
Committee, adopted the 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#147;2008 Incentive Plan&#148;). The purpose

of AirNet:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Participants in the 2008 Incentive Plan include AirNet&#146;s executive officers &#150; Bruce D. Parker
(Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President), Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. (Senior
Vice President, Express Services), Jeffery B. Harris (Senior Vice President, Bank Services), Ray L.
Druseikis (Vice President of Finance and Controller and Principal Accounting Officer; Interim Chief
Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary) and Craig A. Leach (Vice President, Information
Systems) &#151; and certain department managers and department directors. As of the date of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were 37 participants in the 2008 Incentive Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The targeted incentive compensation payment a participant may earn under the 2008 Incentive Plan
ranges from 20% to 100% of the participant&#146;s base salary, depending upon such participant&#146;s level
of responsibility for achieving AirNet&#146;s goals for the 2008 fiscal year. The targeted percentage of
annual base salary that each of AirNet&#146;s executive officers may earn as incentive compensation
under the 2008 Incentive Plan is as follows: Bruce D. Parker, 100%; Larry M. Glasscock, Jr.,
Jeffery B. Harris, 75%; Ray L. Druseikis and Craig A. Leach, 50%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Payments under the 2008 Incentive Plan will be based on a combination of AirNet&#146;s (i)&nbsp;pre-tax
income for the 2008 fiscal year, (ii)&nbsp;Express Services contribution margins for the 2008 fiscal
year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal goals assigned to each participant. The Compensation
Committee determines the personal goals of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive
Officer determines the personal goals for the other executive officers, which are reviewed and
approved by the Compensation Committee. The personal goals of other participants are approved by
the Chief Executive Officer and are reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The personal goals
approved by the Compensation Committee for each of the executive officers relate to specific
business objectives with respect to general business operations (e.g., regulatory compliance,
expense reductions, etc.) and each business segment (e.g., execution of specific contracts with
customers and vendors, cost reductions, service improvements, etc.).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">With the exception of Mr.&nbsp;Parker, no incentive compensation will be paid under the 2008 Incentive
Plan unless AirNet achieves at least 80% of its targeted pre-tax income for the 2008 fiscal year.
Once this designated threshold level of pre-tax income is achieved, potential incentive
compensation payouts will increase at predetermined levels until the maximum incentive compensation
payout is reached at approximately 143% of AirNet&#146;s targeted pre-tax income for the 2008 fiscal
year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Once the aggregate potential incentive compensation payout is determined based upon the level of
pre-tax income achieved by AirNet during the 2008 fiscal year, each participant&#146;s incentive
compensation payment will be determined based upon the following three components of the 2008
Incentive Compensation Plan (i)&nbsp;pre-tax income for the 2008 fiscal year; (ii)&nbsp;Express Services
contribution margins for the 2008 fiscal year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal goals. Twenty
percent of each participant&#146;s incentive compensation payout is allocated to the attainment of
personal goals. The portion of each participant&#146;s incentive compensation potential that is not
allocated to the attainment of personal goals will be allocated to the attainment of
