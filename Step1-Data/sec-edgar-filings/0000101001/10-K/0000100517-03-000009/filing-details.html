<p><b>ITEM 1.&#160; BUSINESS.</b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United Air Lines, Inc. ("United"
or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on December 30, 1968. The world headquarters of the Company is located
at 1200 East Algonquin Road, Elk Grove Township, Illinois 60007.&#160;
The Company's mailing address is P.O. Box 66100, Chicago, Illinois 60666.&#160;
The telephone number for the Company is (847) 700-4000.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United is the principal subsidiary
of UAL Corporation ("UAL"), a Delaware corporation, and is wholly owned
by UAL.&#160; United's operations, which consist primarily of the transportation
of persons, property and mail throughout the U.S. and abroad, accounted
for most of UAL's revenues and expenses in 2002.&#160; United is the second
largest scheduled passenger airline in the world and for the full year
2002 was the industry leader in domestic on-time performance, according
to U.S. Department of Transportation data.

</p><p><b><i>Bankruptcy Considerations</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On December 9, 2002 (the
"Petition Date"), UAL, United and 26 other direct and indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for
relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division, in Chicago (the "Bankruptcy Court") under case numbers 02-B-48191
through 02-B-48218 (the "Chapter 11 Cases"). Specific information pertaining
to the bankruptcy filing may be obtained from the website www.pd-ual.com.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Debtors are currently
operating their business as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable
court orders.&#160; In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are
authorized under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business,
but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business
without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Changes in consumer behavior,
particularly the reduction in business travel and the changes in business
travel patterns, have led to a significant decline in revenues, yield and
revenue passenger miles for United, which in turn have severely impacted
the Company's financial condition and United's ability to meet some of
its maturing debt obligations. The Company filed for bankruptcy because
the Chapter 11 process offered the best available means to facilitate the
implementation of necessary changes to the Debtors' business to bring costs
and operations in line with the current business environment.&#160; In
addition, the protections of the Chapter 11 process offered the Debtors
access to capital through debtor-in-possession financing that otherwise
would not have been available.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On the Petition Date, the
Bankruptcy Court gave interim approval for an aggregate of up to $1.5 billion
in debtor-in-possession secured financing (the "DIP Financing"). The DIP
Financing is structured as a $300 million facility from Bank One, NA (the
"Bank One Facility") and a $1.2 billion facility provided by a group led
by JPMorgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank One, NA and The CIT Group/Business
Credit, Inc. (the "Club Facility").&#160; The Company has received commitments
of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility following the completion of the
syndication process for that facility; the balance is conditioned upon
the participation of one or more additional lenders, subject to approval
by the existing participants.&#160; The Company currently has access to
the entire Bank One Facility and to $500 million of the Club Facility.
Access to the balance of the Club Facility is subject to specified terms
of that facility.&#160; These terms require that the Company achieve performance
milestones under its business plan, which include substantial cost savings
in the near term.&#160; Final approval of the DIP Financing was granted
by the Bankruptcy Court on December 30, 2002.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United's DIP Financing
requires compliance with a number of financial covenants, including the
achievement of specified earnings thresholds.&#160; The adverse economic
impact of external events, such as those described below in "Fuel," "Conflict
with Iraq" and "Employees - Labor Matters," if not offset by the achievement
of savings elsewhere, could lead to a breach of one or more of those covenants
and, absent a waiver from the DIP lenders, their foreclosure on substantial
assets United needs to operate its business.&#160; For more information
on the DIP Financing, see Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In order to exit Chapter
11 successfully, UAL and the Company will need to propose, and obtain confirmation
by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would resolve,
among other things, the Debtors' pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for
its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy. On March 21,
2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the extension to October 2003 of the
Company's "exclusivity period," during which it is the only party permitted
to file a plan of reorganization.&#160; Under certain circumstances, the
exclusivity period could be shortened by two months. The timing of filing
a plan of reorganization by the Company will depend on the timing and outcome
of numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases. Although the
Company expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides for its
emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance
at this time that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under Section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically stays
most actions against a debtor, including most actions to collect pre-petition
indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the debtor's estate.&#160;
Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition
liabilities are subject to settlement under the plan of reorganization.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Notwithstanding the preceding
general discussion of the automatic stay, the Debtors' rights to possess
and operate certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related
equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional
sale contract are governed by a particular provision of the Bankruptcy
Code that specifies different treatment. Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code ("Section 1110") provides that unless the Debtors take certain action,
within 60 days after the Petition Date or such later date as is agreed
by the applicable lessor, secured party, or conditional vendor, the contractual
rights of such financier to take possession of such equipment and to enforce
any of its other rights or remedies under the applicable agreement are
not limited or otherwise affected by the automatic stay or any other provision
of the Bankruptcy Code. For more information on Section 1110, see "Properties
- Flight Equipment" under Item 2 below and Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</u>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain
executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property,
aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and certain other conditions.&#160; In general, rejection of an unexpired
lease or executory contract is treated as a pre-petition breach of the
lease or contract in question. Subject to certain exceptions, this rejection
relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under that
lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a
pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by the deemed breach.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Counterparties to these rejected
contracts or leases may file proofs of claim against the Debtors' estate
for such damages.&#160; Due to the uncertain nature of many of the potential
rejection and abandonment related claims, the Company is unable to project
the magnitude of these claims with any degree of certainty at this time.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Generally, the assumption
of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires a debtor to cure most
existing defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Bankruptcy Code provides
special treatment for collective bargaining agreements ("CBAs"). In particular,
Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code permits the Company to move to reject
its collective bargaining agreements if the Company first satisfies a number
of statutorily prescribed substantive and procedural prerequisites and
obtains the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the rejection. After bargaining
in good faith and sharing relevant information with its unions, the debtor
must make proposals to modify its existing CBAs based on the most complete
and reliable information available at the time. The proposed modifications
must be necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and must ensure
that all the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably relative
to the creditors and the debtor. Ultimately, rejection is appropriate if
the unions refuse to agree to the debtors necessary proposals "without
good cause" and the balance of the equities favors rejection. See "Employees
- Labor Matters" below under this Item 1 and "Labor Matters" under <u>Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The United States Trustee
for the Northern District of Illinois (the "U.S. Trustee") has appointed
an official committee of unsecured creditors (the "Creditors' Committee").&#160;
The Creditors' Committee and its legal representatives have a right to
be heard on all matters that come before the Bankruptcy Court.&#160; There
can be no assurance that the Creditors' Committee will support the Debtors'
positions or the Debtors' ultimate plan of reorganization, once proposed,
and disagreements between the Debtors and the Creditors' Committee could
protract the Chapter 11 Cases, could negatively impact the Debtors' ability
to operate during the Chapter 11 Cases and could prevent the Debtors' emergence
from Chapter 11.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At this time, it is not possible
to predict accurately the effect of the Chapter 11 reorganization process
on the Company's business or when it may emerge from Chapter 11.&#160;
The Company's future results depend on the timely and successful confirmation
and implementation of a plan of reorganization. The rights and claims of
various creditors and security holders will be determined by the plan as
well.&#160; No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be
ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies,
and it is possible that UAL's equity or UAL's or United's other securities
will be restructured in a manner that will reduce substantially or eliminate
any remaining value. Accordingly, the Company urges that appropriate caution
be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any of
such securities and claims.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On February 24, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court entered a preliminary injunction in order to restrict
the trading of UAL's common stock and debt interests in UAL or the Company.
The purpose of the preliminary injunction was to ensure that the Company
did not lose the benefit of its net operating loss ("NOL"). Under federal
and state income tax law, an NOL can be used to offset future taxable income,
and thus is an extremely valuable asset. However, a company can lose the
benefit of its NOLs if the company is deemed to undergo an "ownership change"
under certain very specific tax rules in the Internal Revenue Code. Excessive
trading in a company's stock (or debt when the company is in bankruptcy)
can trigger such an "ownership change," and thus the Company sought to
restrict the trading of UAL's common stock and debt interests.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the terms of the preliminary
injunction, no person can buy or sell UAL stock if that person holds more
than 4.8 million shares of UAL common stock or would hold more than 4.8
million shares after the purchase. Any person who holds more than $200
million in debt claims against UAL must register as a "substantial claimholder"
with UAL, and no person may acquire debt claims against UAL if the acquisition
of the claims would cause them to hold more than $200 million in such claims.

</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Central to the Company's
reorganization and emergence from Chapter 11 is its plan for transformation,
which outlines the fundamental changes to United's strategic direction.
The plan, which the Company seeks to refine through further collaboration
with its employee and creditor constituencies, is intended to lay the foundation
for a company that is successful and competitive for the long run. Core
objectives of the plan are the reduction of United's labor and non-labor
costs and the development of a more comprehensive and compelling portfolio
of products. Key operational elements of the plan include: (1) the preservation
and enhancement of United's extensive mainline service targeted primarily
at the business traveler; (2) the creation of a low-cost offering to compete
directly with low-cost carriers for leisure and price-sensitive travelers;
(3) the growth of the Company's United Express regional operations and
(4) the expansion of United's domestic and international alliances. See

</p><p><b><u>Operations</u></b>
</p><p><b><i>Segments.</i></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United operates its businesses
through four reporting segments:&#160; North America, the Pacific, the
Atlantic and Latin America.&#160; Financial information on United's operating
segments can be found in Note 17, "Segment Information" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2002, United carried
approximately 69 million passengers and flew approximately 109 billion
revenue passenger miles.&#160; United's network provides comprehensive
transportation service within its North American segment and to international
destinations within its Pacific, Atlantic and Latin America segments.
<br/>Operating revenues attributed to United's North America segment were
$8.8 billion in 2002, $10.7 billion in 2001 and $13.1 billion in 2000.&#160;
Operating revenues attributed to United's international segments were $4.7
billion in 2002, $5.4 billion in 2001 and $6.2 billion in 2000.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>North America</u>.&#160;
As of March 24, 2003, United serves approximately 83 destinations throughout
North America and operates hubs in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco
and Washington, D.C.&#160; United's North America operations accounted
for 65.1% of United's revenues in 2002.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Pacific</u>.&#160; Via
its Tokyo hub, United provides passenger service between its U.S. gateway
cities (Chicago, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle)
and the Asian cities of Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and
Taipei.&#160; United also provides nonstop service between Hong Kong and
each of Chicago and San Francisco; between San Francisco and each of Osaka,
Shanghai, Sydney and Melbourne (via Sydney); between Los Angeles and Sydney
and Melbourne (via Sydney); and between Chicago and Beijing.&#160; In 2002,
United's Pacific operations accounted for 17.9% of United's operating revenues.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Atlantic</u>.&#160; Washington,
D.C. is United's primary gateway to Europe, serving Amsterdam, Brussels,
Frankfurt, London, Munich and Paris.&#160; Chicago is United's secondary
gateway to Europe, with nonstop service to Frankfurt, London and Paris.&#160;
United also provides nonstop service between San Francisco and each of
London and Frankfurt; and between London and each of Los Angeles, Newark
and New York.&#160; In 2002, United's Atlantic operations accounted for
13.5% of United's operating revenues.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Latin America</u>.&#160;
United's primary gateway to Latin America is Washington, D.C., providing
service from Washington, D.C. to Aruba, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro (one-stop),
Sao Paolo, San Juan and St. Thomas.&#160; United also provides service
from Mexico City to each of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington,
D.C., and San Jose (Costa Rica).&#160; In addition, United has service
from Chicago to Aruba, Montevideo (one-stop), San Juan, Sao Paulo and St.
Thomas; between Miami and Buenos Aires, and Sao Paulo; between Los Angeles
and Guatemala City, San Jose (one-stop) and San Salvador; between New York
and San Juan; and between Guatemala City and San Jose.&#160; In 2002, United's
Latin America operations accounted for 3.5% of United's revenues.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United Cargo<sup>&#174;</sup>.</i></b>&#160;
United Cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through its
Small Package Delivery; T.D. Guaranteed; First Freight; International Freight;
UA 2-Day service; and United SameDay.&#160; Freight accounts for most of
United Cargo's shipments, while mail remains an important component of
United's cargo strategy.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For the year 2002, United
Cargo generated approximately $673 million in freight and mail revenue,
which represents a 4.4% decrease versus 2001.&#160; Traffic has gradually
improved, but volumes remain below pre-September 11, 2001 levels.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In August 2002, United Cargo
opened a new cargo warehouse facility in Chicago, which is presently the
largest facility for processing freight and mail in North America.&#160;
This completes United Cargo's planned investment in facilities.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In January of 2003, United
Cargo, along with Unisys Corporation and two other cargo carriers, launched
Cargo Portal Services, an internet portal that allows freight forwarders
to book and manage shipments more easily through the delivery cycle.&#160;
By providing enhanced computer-based communications between customers and
air carriers, United expects Cargo Portal Services to reduce transaction
costs for both United and its customers.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Fuel.</i></b>&#160;
Fuel is United's second largest cost behind labor.&#160;&#160; United's
fuel costs and consumption for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The price and availability
of jet fuel significantly affect United's operations. Based on projected
2003 fuel consumption, the Company estimates that every $0.01 change in
the average annual price-per-gallon of jet fuel will impact United's 2003
fuel costs by approximately $21 million, absent any fuel hedging arrangements.&#160;
Due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, United may
be unable to pass on to its customers any increased fuel costs that it
may encounter.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To help mitigate against
price increases, United in the past has entered into hedging arrangements.
In 2002, United hedged 26% of its fuel consumption using crude oil and
heating oil swaps.&#160; United had also put in place hedges for 7% of
its estimated fuel consumption for the first half of 2003 (the impact of
these hedges is included in the total fuel cost shown above).&#160;&#160;
However, as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the derivatives
counterparties terminated all outstanding swap contracts, leaving United
completely unhedged.&#160; As market conditions and its economic outlook
change, the Company continually evaluates the potential economic benefit
of entering into fuel hedging arrangements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To ensure adequate supplies
of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs, United ships
fuel on major pipelines and stores fuel close to its major hub locations.&#160;
Although the Company currently does not anticipate a significant reduction
in the availability of jet fuel, a number of factors make accurate predictions
impossible, including geopolitical uncertainties in oil-producing nations.
For example, hostilities in Iraq could lead to disruptions in oil production
and/or to substantially increased oil prices.&#160; The continuing political
turmoil in Venezuela also could have similar effects.
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Insurance.</b></i>&#160;
United carries hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the
air transportation industry, in amounts which it deems adequate, covering
passenger liability, public liability and damage to United's aircraft and
other physical property.&#160; However, as a result of the September 11,
2001 terrorist attacks, the premiums have increased significantly.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Additionally, after September
11, 2001 commercial insurers cancelled United's liability insurance for
losses resulting from war perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other
similar perils), but United obtained replacement coverage through the FAA.&#160;
Under the Homeland Security Act, which became effective in February 2003,
the FAA is authorized to offer this insurance through August 31, 2003,
and it may be extended to December 31, 2003, if the federal government
determines such an extension is in the national interest. Likewise, United
maintains hull war risk insurance through the FAA program, which provides
worldwide coverage for war and associated perils (including hijacking and
confiscation).&#160; There can be no assurance, however, that the FAA insurance
will continue to be available.&#160; Should the FAA discontinue this coverage,
obtaining it from commercial underwriters could result in substantially
higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if it is available at all.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Also, United maintains other
types of insurance such as property and casualty, directors and officers,
cargo, automobile and the like, with limits and deductibles that are standard
within the industry.&#160; Compared to insurance prior to September 11,
the premiums are substantially higher with lower limits.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Program.</i>&#160; </b>In time of war or certain other national emergencies,
the U.S. government can require United and other major air carriers to
provide airlift services to the U.S. Military under the Civil Reserve Air
Fleet Program ("CRAF").&#160; On February 8, 2003, the U.S. government
activated CRAF (for only the second time since the program was established
in 1951) because the U.S. military's airlift needs exceeded the military's
capabilities in connection with the buildup of troops in the Middle East.&#160;
As a result, United, along with other U.S. commercial airlines, is currently
participating in the transportation of troops and cargo to the Middle East.&#160;
While United's participation in the CRAF program to date has had a positive
impact on United's earnings, should United be required to provide a more
substantial amount of these services for an extended period, its business
could be adversely impacted.
</p><p><b><u>Conflict With Iraq</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In anticipation of the U.S.
conflict with Iraq, United conducted extensive contingency preparations
and developed a plan to address the likely effects on the airline industry
as a whole and on United in particular. With the initiation of the military
campaign on March 19, 2003, United implemented that plan, which included
an immediate reduction in capacity of 8% effective April 6, 2003 and placing
a number of employees on temporary unpaid leave.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition, United has been
working with other carriers, major labor unions and the Air Transport Association,
a trade association of major U.S. airlines, to develop and propose a comprehensive
government assistance package for the carriers. Potential components could
include relief from certain taxes, the payment by the federal government
of all costs for airport security, opening up the Strategic Oil Reserve
and government-provided terrorism insurance for the airlines. At this time
it is impossible to assess the prospects of such legislation and there
can be no assurance that Congress or the President will approve this or
any other relief for the industry.
</p><p><font color="#FF0000">&#160;</font><font color="#000000">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Further, if other relief is insufficient or is unavailable on a timely
basis, the Company may seek to implement additional, temporary wage reductions
for all employees.</font>
</p><p><b><u>Marketing Strategy</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United seeks to attract customers
and create customer preference for United by providing a comprehensive
network, an attractive frequent flyer program and enhanced and differentiated
product and service offerings.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Alliances.</i></b>&#160;
United has entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances
with other airlines to provide its customers more choices and to participate
in markets worldwide that it does not serve directly.&#160; These collaborative
marketing arrangements typically include one or more of the following features:
joint frequent flyer participation; code sharing of flight operations (whereby
one carrier's flights can be marketed under the two-letter airline designator
code of another carrier); coordination of reservations, baggage handling
and flight schedules; and other resource-sharing activities.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The most significant of these
is the Star Alliance<font face="Symbol">&#212;</font><font size="-2">, </font>a
global integrated airline network co-founded by United in 1997.&#160; As
of December 31, 2002, Star Alliance carriers served approximately 727 destinations
in approximately 125 countries with approximately 10,622 daily flights.&#160;
Current Star Alliance partners, in addition to United, are Air Canada,
Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Asiana, Austrian Airlines, bmi, Lauda
Air, Lufthansa, Mexicana, SAS, Singapore Airways, Thai International Airways,
Tyrolean and Varig.&#160; Two additional carriers are expected to join
in 2003: Spanair as of April 1 and LOT Polish Airlines as of October 26.&#160;
United currently holds bilateral antitrust immunity with Air Canada and
integrated antitrust immunity with Lufthansa, SAS and the Austrian Airlines
Group (which includes Austrian Airlines, Lauda Air and Tyrolean).&#160;
United has limited antitrust immunity with bmi subject to completion of
an "Open Skies" Agreement between the U.S. and U.K. For more information
on Open Skies and international rights, see "Government Regulation" in
this Item 1.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In July 2002, United announced
the development of a marketing partnership with US Airways to include joint
frequent flyer participation, joint lounge access and code sharing on certain
flights. Currently, United and US Airways have substantially implemented
the first two of those arrangements. The carriers currently code share
on selected flights and expect to complete the implementation of the code
sharing element of the partnership by the end of 2003, subject to certain
conditions imposed by the U.S. government. On August 11, 2002, US Airways
and certain subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code. That case is still pending before the Bankruptcy
Court. Although US Airways has filed a plan of reorganization that has
been approved by its creditors and confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and
that provides for its emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern, there
can be no assurance that such plan will be implemented successfully. If
US Airways is unable to emerge as a going concern or if it emerges as a
significantly smaller or different company, the anticipated benefits to
United of the marketing partnership may never materialize and United's
business may suffer.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United has also formed independent
marketing agreements with other air carriers, including Aloha, BWIA West
Indies Airways, Continental Connection (operated by Gulfstream), Great
Lakes Airlines (a regional carrier) and Spanair.&#160; United continually
evaluates the need for relationships with these and other carriers and
from time to time will change its independent marketing partners as conditions
warrant.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition, United operates
the United Express<sup><font size="-2">&#174; </font></sup>marketing program
in North America, under which independent regional carriers serve small
and medium-sized cities and link them to United's mainline network.&#160;
United Express carriers are Air Wisconsin Airlines, Atlantic Coast Airlines
and Sky West Airlines.&#160; On February 27, 2003, United announced that
it had entered into an agreement with Mesa Air Group, Inc., pursuant to
which Mesa Air will become a United Express carrier on western routes.
As part of the Chapter 11 process, the Company is reevaluating each of
the contracts with the three existing United Express carriers and may renegotiate
or reject any of these agreements in connection with its reorganization.
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Mileage Plus and Other
Loyalty Programs.</b></i>&#160; The Mileage Plus frequent flyer program
was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards and services
to frequent travelers.&#160; More than 40 million members have enrolled
in Mileage Plus since it began in 1981.&#160; Mileage Plus members earn
mileage credit for flights on United, United Express, the Star Alliance
carriers and certain other airlines that participate in the program.&#160;
Miles also can be earned by purchasing the goods and services of non-airline
program participants, such as hotels, car rental companies and credit card
issuers.&#160; Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or
upgraded travel and non-travel awards. For a detailed description of the
treatment of Mileage Plus awards, see "Critical Accounting Policies" in
<u>Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL Loyalty Services, Inc.
("ULS"), a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL, operates substantially all United-branded
travel distribution and customer loyalty e-commerce activities, such as
united.com, and also owns and manages UAL's interests in various third-party
e-commerce enterprises, such as Orbitz and Hotwire.&#160; In addition,
as of the first quarter of 2002, ULS owns and operates the Mileage Plus
frequent flyer programs and is responsible for certain aspects of it, including
member relationships, communications and account management, while United
continues to be responsible for the elite frequent flyer aspects of the
program, including the Premier, Premier Executive and Premier Executive
1K programs, as well as the air travel accrual and award aspects of the
program.&#160; United also retains responsibility for managing the relationship
with Mileage Plus' airline partners, while ULS manages relationships with
non-airline business partners, such as the Mileage Plus Visa Card, hotels,
car rental companies and dining programs. ULS also owns and operates certain
other United-branded customer programs as well as the MyPoints.com online
loyalty program, under which registered consumers earn points for goods
and services purchased from participating vendors.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Distribution Channels.</i></b>&#160;
The overwhelming majority of United's airline inventory continues to be
distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global
distribution systems ("GDS").&#160; The U.S. Department of Transportation
("DOT") has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that could significantly
change the rules under which carriers deal with the GDS.&#160; These new
rules are expected to be finalized in January 2004.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United uses the Apollo reservation
system, which is hosted by Galileo International.&#160; The hosting agreement
with Galileo continues through 2004.
</p><p><b><u>Industry Conditions</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Operating Environment.</i></b>&#160;
The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.&#160; United's
operations can be adversely impacted by winter weather and United's first-
and fourth-quarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand. Historically,
operating results are better in the second and third quarters.&#160; The
events of September 11, 2001, and the recession in the U.S. economy distorted
the normal seasonal relationships in 2001 and 2002. As a result of the
U.S. war with Iraq, the typical seasonal fluctuations may continue to be
disrupted in 2003.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Competition.</i></b>&#160;
The airline industry is highly competitive.&#160; In domestic markets,
new and existing carriers are free to initiate service on any route.&#160;
United's domestic competitors include all of the other major U.S. airlines
as well as regional carriers, most of which have lower cost structures
than United. Recently, three of United's largest competitors, Delta Airlines,
Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines, have given notice of their
intention to implement a comprehensive code sharing arrangement, subject
to certain regulatory approval. The successful introduction of this arrangement,
or of other comparable arrangements by other carriers, likely will further
intensify domestic competition.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In its international service,
United competes not only with U.S. airlines, but also with foreign carriers.&#160;
United's competition on specified international routes is subject to varying
degrees of governmental regulations (see "Government Regulation"). United
has advantages over foreign air carriers in the U.S. because of its ability
to generate U.S. origin-destination traffic from its integrated domestic
route systems, and because foreign carriers are prohibited by U.S. law
from carrying local passengers between two points in the U.S.&#160; United
experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries.&#160; In addition,
U.S. carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers to points
beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air
service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments.&#160;
To compensate for these structural limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers
have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow the carriers
to provide traffic feed to each other's flights.&#160; See "Marketing Strategy
- Alliances."
</p><p><b><u>Government Regulation</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Domestic Regulation.</i></b>&#160;
All carriers engaged in air transportation in the U.S. are subject to regulation
by the DOT.&#160; Among its responsibilities, the DOT has authority to
issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air
transportation, grant international route authorities, approve international
code share agreements, regulate methods of competition and enforce certain
consumer protection regulations, such as those dealing with advertising,
denied boarding compensation and baggage liability.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Airlines are also regulated
by the FAA, primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and
other safety and technical matters. The FAA has authority to issue air
carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates,
prescribe maintenance procedures, and regulate pilot and other employee
training, among other responsibilities. The FAA also administers the U.S.
air-traffic control system. From time to time, the FAA issues rules that
require air carriers to take certain actions, such as the inspection or
modification of aircraft and other equipment, that may cause United to
incur substantial, unplanned expenses.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; From time to time, the Company
is subject to inquiries by these and other U.S. and international regulatory
bodies. The Company does not believe that any such existing inquiries will
have a material effect on its business.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Access to landing and take-off
rights, or "slots," at four U.S. airports historically has been subject
to government regulation. At these airports, O'Hare International in Chicago,
John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia in New York, and Reagan National
in Washington, D.C., the FAA has regulated the number of available slots.
The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century,
enacted in April of 2000, eliminated all slot restrictions at O'Hare in
July of 2002 and called for the elimination of slot restrictions at Kennedy
and LaGuardia by 2007. The eliminations to date have not had, and the planned
eliminations are not expected to have, a material effect on the Company.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>International Regulation.</i></b>&#160;
Internationally, the Company is subject to the aviation authorities of
the foreign countries that United serves. These authorities may from time
to time impose regulations beyond those that apply to United's domestic
operations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Historically, access to foreign
markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral treaties regulating
the number of points served, the number of carriers and the frequencies
of flights. More recently, the U.S. has pursued a policy of "Open Skies,"
under which the U.S. government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements
allowing unrestricted access to foreign markets. While a considerable number
of foreign governments have agreed to Open Skies, several major markets
remain subject to restrictive bilateral agreements. Among them are London
and Tokyo, where United has significant operations. Further, United's ability
to serve some countries and its expansion into certain others is limited
by the absence altogether of aviation agreements between the U.S. and the
relevant governments. Shifts in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies
can lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements between
the U.S. and other countries.&#160; These changes could diminish the value
of United's international route authority because changes in these agreements
could curtail or terminate United's international rights in the associated
markets.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2002, United sought
to expand its access to and presence in Asia.&#160; In response to United's
application for additional frequencies under newly negotiated rights in
the U.S.-Hong Kong bilateral agreement, the DOT awarded United rights that
will allow United to operate a second daily Hong Kong-Tokyo flight.&#160;
United also was awarded an additional code share frequency to serve Vietnam,
which brings the carrier's current pool of Vietnam code share frequencies
to eight.&#160; Although Vietnam holds significant commercial potential,
the absence of an air service treaty between the United States and Vietnam
prohibits U.S. carriers from serving this market directly.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The air services agreement
between the U.S. and Japan provides an unlimited number of frequencies
to certain carriers, including United.&#160; United also holds significant
traffic rights from Japan to other locations within the Pacific.&#160;
These rights and the 2002 opening of Tokyo's Narita airport's second runway
provided United with the opportunity to add service in 2002 between Tokyo
and Taipei.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In connection with its international
services, United is required to make regular filings with the DOT and,
in some cases, to observe rules establishing the tariffs charged and service
provided.&#160; In some cases, fares and schedules also require the approval
of the relevant foreign governments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The European Union (the "EU")
is taking an increasingly active role in regulating international aviation.
In October of 2002, the European Commission granted antitrust immunity,
subject to certain conditions, to United, Lufthansa and SAS.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In November 2002, the European
Court of Justice issued a ruling that invalidated certain provisions of
aviation agreements between the U.S. and the EU.&#160; The governments
are committed to ensuring that this ruling does not interrupt existing
air service.&#160; This decision paves the way for the EU to negotiate
aviation treaties on behalf of EU Member States with other non-EU countries.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The European Commission continues
its attempts to modify the existing regulation that governs slots at EU
airports.&#160; The most recent proposal, if accepted, would have the effect
of favoring EU airlines and would dramatically alter the manner in which
EU slots are held and allocated. The proposed changes threaten to redefine
the issue of slot ownership and impede the selling and trading of slots.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Starting in late 2001 and
continuing through March 24, 2002, airport authorities and other regulatory
bodies granted United and other international slot holders short-term waivers
from an international rule that ordinarily requires a carrier to forfeit
any slot that it uses less than 80% of the time in any season.&#160; Separately,
the DOT waived through March 31, 2002 its requirement that U.S. carriers
in limited-entry international markets return to the DOT frequencies in
those markets that they do not use more than 90 days. In light of the current
conflict with Iraq, United and other carriers are seeking comparable waivers
of the slot and frequency-of-use requirements from domestic and international
regulatory bodies and airport authorities.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Legislation.</i></b>&#160;
The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the
"Stabilization Act") established the federal Air Transportation Stabilization
Board ("ATSB") and made $5 billion in federal grants and $10 billion in
loan guarantees conditionally available to the airline industry.&#160;
The legislation also provides relief from increased insurance premiums,
caps potential liability from the September 11 terrorist attacks, limits
liability for any future terrorist events and creates a federal compensation
fund for attack victims.&#160; In 2001 and 2002, United received $782 million
in grants. On June 24, 2002, UAL submitted an application to the ATSB for
a loan guarantee in connection with a contemplated financing. After discussions
with the ATSB and subsequent revision to the application, on December 4,
2002, the ATSB informed the Company that it had not approved the application.
Notwithstanding the denial of the Company's application for a pre-petition
loan guarantee, United has been continuing to work with the ATSB toward
the possible funding of a loan that would provide financing to the Company
upon its exit from bankruptcy.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Separate legislation enacted
in November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the "Aviation
Act"), has had wide-ranging effects on United's operations.&#160; The Aviation
Act makes the federal government responsible for virtually all aspects
of security that United has traditionally provided.&#160; The Aviation
Act created a new government agency, the TSA, responsible for aviation
security. Notably, the Aviation Act required that the security screener
workforce be composed entirely of federal employees by November 2002.&#160;
Regulations under the Aviation Act also require carriers to charge passengers
in the U.S. a security fee of $2.50 per enplanement, capped at $10.00 per
round trip and to remit that fee to the DOT.&#160; The DOT, as provided
in the Aviation Act, also has assessed an additional fee, equal to the
amount paid by carriers for security screening in the year 2000, directly
on air carriers to compensate for the costs of screening activities and
property.&#160; The Aviation Act mandates numerous additional security
measures, including that, as of December 31, 2002, all checked baggage
be screened by explosive detection systems.
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Privacy Laws.</b></i>&#160;
An initiative of significant impact within the EU and elsewhere is the
introduction of privacy standards that apply to companies transmitting
private information from the EU to non-EU countries.&#160; To comply with
the privacy directives, the U.S. Commerce Department and the EU have agreed
to safe harbor principles.&#160; Although the safe harbor principles are
voluntary at this time, United plans to comply with them.&#160; The U.S.
Commerce Department and the EU continue to review the status of voluntary
compliance.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Canada, Argentina and Australia
have enacted new privacy laws covering the collection and disclosure of
personally identifiable information.&#160; These laws may have an impact
on the way United collects and transmits personally identifiable information
in these jurisdictions.
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Environmental Regulations.</b></i>&#160;
The Company (similar to others in the airline industry) is subject to federal,
state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning
emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe
drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils, and waste
materials.&#160; The Company and the industry are also subject to other
environmental laws and regulations, including those that require the Company
to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives.&#160; It is
the Company's policy to comply with all environmental laws and regulations,
which can require expenditures.&#160; The Company also conducts voluntary
remediation actions.&#160; These costs are not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known
as "Superfund") and similar environmental clean-up laws, waste generators
can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at
disposal sites that have been identified as requiring response actions.&#160;
The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party (by
a governmental unit or private party) at certain sites that could result
in future expenditures, including the Mattiace Petrochemical Superfund
Site, the Approved Oil Superfund Site, the Chemsol Inc. Superfund Site,
and the Gibson Environmental Inc. Superfund Site.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; There is a dispute primarily
among United, American, and Ogden Services (as well as Northwest Airlines
and Delta) concerning the responsibility for payment of certain clean up
costs for groundwater and soil contamination near terminals 8 and 9 at
New York's JFK Airport.&#160; The parties' views on proper allocation of
the costs differ. This litigation, which was initiated in 2000 in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, is currently stayed because of the bankruptcy.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Miami International Airport
has been conducting a long-term project to investigate and remediate soil
and groundwater contamination at the airport.&#160; Recently, the Miami
International Airport has identified a multitude of current and former
tenants it believes should help pay for these remedial measures, and United
is one of these tenants.&#160; While the airport initiated a lawsuit in
2001 against a handful of potentially responsible parties, United is not
one of the parties named in the lawsuit.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In accordance with a June
1999 order issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board
("CRWQCB"), United, along with most of the other tenants of the San Francisco
International Airport, has been investigating potential environmental contamination
at the airport and conducting remediation when needed.&#160; Among these
projects is an investigation and remediation project for solvent impacts
to soil and groundwater at the San Francisco Maintenance Center.&#160;
This project is being conducted in accordance with CRWQCB approvals.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In August 2002, the Company
entered into a settlement with the U.S. EPA to address voluntarily disclosed
Clean Air Act violations associated with the requirement that low-sulfur
diesel fuel be used in certain ground support equipment.&#160; This settlement
involves a penalty payment and performance of a Supplemental Environmental
Project (involving the replacement of some older ground support equipment
with new electric-powered equipment).
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The U.S. EPA and the State
of California are seeking penalties, and potentially injunctive relief,
from United for alleged non-compliance with hazardous waste generator requirements
at United's San Francisco Maintenance Center identified in 1999 and 2001.&#160;
United has been working with both governmental entities to resolve this
matter.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition to the matters
discussed above, from time to time the Company becomes aware of potential
non-compliance with environmental regulations, which have either been identified
by the Company (through its internal environmental compliance auditing
program) or through a governmental entity.&#160; In some instances, these
matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial
proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions of $100,000
or more.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company does not expect
these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material adverse
effect on the Company.
</p><p><b><u>Employees - Labor Matters</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of March 1, 2003, the
Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 72,000 employees, of which
approximately 80% are represented by various labor organizations.&#160;
This number represents a significant reduction from the end of 2001, when
the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 84,000 employees.&#160;
This reduction was a direct response to the continuing adverse impact on
air travel resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, reduced
demand for air travel in general, as well as United's concerted efforts
to reduce costs.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The employee groups, number
of employees, labor organization and current contract status for each of
United's collective bargaining groups, as of February 28, 2003, were as

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Collective bargaining agreements
("CBAs") are negotiated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor
relations in the transportation industry, and typically do not contain
an expiration date.&#160; Instead, they specify an amendable date, upon
which the contract is considered "open for amendment."&#160; Prior to the
amendable date, neither party is required to agree to modifications to
the bargaining agreement.&#160; Nevertheless, nothing prevents the parties
from agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the agreement in advance
of the amendable date. Contracts remain in effect while new agreements
are negotiated.&#160; During the negotiating period, both the Company and
the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>In order to meet the
earnings covenant under the DIP Financing, United needed to obtain substantial
labor savings from its employees by mid-February 2003. Therefore, the Company
imposed immediate wage reductions on its management and salaried employees,
including officers in December 2002. Additionally, United immediately began
negotiations with all of its unions in early December regarding the changes
to the Company's CBAs necessary to satisfy United's short-term and long-term
financial and business imperatives.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the event the parties
cannot reach consensual modifications, Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code permits the Company to move to reject its CBAs. Under Section 1113(c),
the Company must satisfy several statutorily prescribed substantive and
procedural prerequisites before the Bankruptcy Court will authorize the
Company to reject its CBAs. In order to meet the deadline imposed by the
DIP Financing covenants for reducing its labor costs, United had been prepared
to file a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code by December 26, 2002, if consensual CBA modifications could
not be reached before that date.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As the December 26 deadline
neared, however, United and several of its unions agreed to consensual
interim wage relief from its unions that would allow United and its unions
more time to continue negotiations to reach agreements on the CBA modifications
necessary for United to reorganize successfully while still meeting the
short-term financial imperatives established by the DIP covenants. United
reached agreements with four of its five unions to reduce wages on an interim
basis, effective January 1, 2003 to April 30, 2003. The leadership of the
IAM rejected the Company's proposal and therefore, on December 27, 2002,
United filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to impose a wage reduction
for the IAM-represented employees. On January 10, 2003, the Bankruptcy
Court granted the Company's motion.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the terms of the interim
agreements with its unions, and the relief granted by the Bankruptcy Court
against the IAM, United agreed not to file a motion to reject its CBAs
pursuant to Section 1113(c) before March 15, 2003. In the meantime, United
and its unions continued negotiations. The Company's DIP covenants, however,
still require United to obtain all of the relief sought in its proposed
CBA modifications by May 1, 2003. As a result, on March 17, 2003, United
filed a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) and the Bankruptcy
Court has scheduled hearings on this motion April 14. March 17 was the
deadline by which such a motion needed to be filed to ensure that the Company
could obtain a ruling on its motion by May 1, 2003 and stay in compliance
with its DIP Financing covenants. Without the full relief sought by United's
proposed CBA modifications becoming effective by early May, the Company
will be unable to meet its covenants, entitling its DIP lenders to foreclose
on substantial assets United needs to operate its business.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On March 26, 2003,
the Company reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association,
International ("ALPA") on a restructured CBA. The agreement, which will
become effective May 1, 2003, if ratified by the pilot membership, has
a 6-year duration and would reduce pay and benefits, and improve productivity
(through work rule changes), by an average of approximately $1.1 billion
per year versus the current contract.&#160; As part of these changes, retirement
and medical benefits for pilots would be reduced through a decrease in
the Company's contribution to the pilot defined contribution plan, a reduction
in the formula for their defined benefit plan, and changes to the medical
plan including increases to co-payments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The tentative agreement
includes a success-sharing program that provides the opportunity for annual
pay-outs tied to the Company's level of profitability and performance.&#160;
The tentative agreement provides for significantly enhanced flexibility
with respect to regional jets, code share arrangements and a low-cost offering.&#160;
Finally, the Company has agreed to include in its plan of reorganization
provisions that pilots would receive a distribution of the equity, securities
or other consideration provided to the general unsecured creditors.&#160;
Additionally, the Company had agreed that any plan of reorganization it
proposes or supports will provide the pilot group with a distribution of
the above-described equity, securities or other consideration (as compared
to the total distribution provided to all employee groups) which matches
the proportion of pilots' contribution to total employee cost reductions.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The pilot contribution
in the tentative agreement represents a significant portion of the overall
labor cost reductions sought by the Company.&#160; Should the Company be
unable to obtain labor cost reductions from any of its union groups (through
consensual agreements or otherwise) which fall below the relief the Company
has articulates as necessary from that group, the Company has agreed to
proportionately reduce ALPA's approximate $1.1 billion contribution.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December 31, 2002,
all 267 of the aircraft owned by United were encumbered under debt agreements.&#160;
For additional information on accounting for these aircraft see Note 10,
"Long-Term Debt" and Note 11, "Lease Obligations" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United has on firm order
with the manufacturers 42 Airbus A319-100 and A320-200 and one Boeing 777-200
aircraft. The Company is evaluating these contracts in light of its financial
condition and operational requirements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In connection with the Company's
bankruptcy reorganization under Chapter 11, United is reassessing its fleet
requirements and is seeking to reduce significantly its aircraft financing
costs. Central to this undertaking is the Company's effort to readjust
lease and mortgage payments for aircraft whose fair market values have
fallen since the execution of the original agreements. United is negotiating
with a significant number of its aircraft lenders and lessors to restructure
the underlying financings to reflect current market rates. Although the
Company has reached agreements in principle with respect to a number of
aircraft, there can be no assurance that those tentative arrangements will
be successfully converted to final contracts, or that other comparable
arrangements will be available to the Company. To the extent United is
unable to reach final agreements at economically attractive terms for the
requisite number of aircraft, its financial and operational performance
may be adversely affected.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the automatic stay lasts for only 60 days with respect
to Section 1110-eligible aircraft, engines and related equipment except
under two conditions. The debtor may extend the 60-day period by agreement
of the relevant financier, with court approval. Alternatively, the debtor
may agree to perform all of the obligations under the applicable financing
and cure any defaults thereunder as required by the Bankruptcy Code. In
the absence of either such arrangement, the financier may take possession
of the property and enforce any of its contractual rights or remedies to
sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such equipment.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The 60-day period under Section
1110 in the Company's Chapter 11 Case expired on February 7, 2003. The
Company has reached agreements with a significant number of aircraft financiers
to extend the automatic stay, in exchange in certain instances for United's
agreement to make specified payments. United also has made elections with
respect to certain other aircraft to cure all existing defaults and to
pay the contract rates as required by the Bankruptcy Code. With respect
to certain aircraft, however, United neither negotiated an extension of
the automatic stay nor agreed to cure and resume payments. Accordingly,
the financiers of such aircraft may seek to repossess the property. Although
no such financiers have sought to repossess any United equipment, and although
the Company believes that market conditions for commercial aircraft make
repossession unlikely, there can be no assurance that United's lendors
and lessors will not repossess any of the applicable aircraft. Any such
repossessions could result in substantial disruptions to United's operations
and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For more information on Section
1110, see Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</u>
</p><p><b><u>Ground Facilities</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United has entered into various
leases relating to its use of airport landing areas, gates, hangar sites,
terminal buildings and other airport facilities in most of the municipalities
it serves.&#160; Major leases expire at San Francisco in 2003 and 2011,
Oakland in 2007, Washington-Dulles in 2014, Chicago O'Hare in 2018, Los
Angeles in 2021, Denver in 2025 and Indianapolis in 2031.&#160; United
intends to exercise its rights under the 2003 San Francisco lease by extending
the term until 2013 pursuant to a 10-year renewal option. United owns a
106-acre complex in suburban Chicago consisting of more than 1,000,000
square feet of office space for its world headquarters, a computer facility
and a training center.&#160; United also owns a flight training center,
located in the City and County of Denver, that can accommodate 36 flight
simulators and more than 90 computer-based training stations.&#160; Both
the Chicago and Denver facilities are fully mortgaged. United owns a limited
number of other properties, including a reservations facility and an office
building in Denver and a crew hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii; all of these facilities
are fully mortgaged.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United's Maintenance Operation
Center at San Francisco International Airport occupies 129 acres of land,
3,000,000 square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar docks under
a lease expiring in 2003, with an option to extend for 10 years.&#160;
United intends to exercise its rights under the lease agreement by extending
the term until 2013 pursuant to the renewal option. United's Indianapolis
Maintenance Center, a major aircraft maintenance and overhaul facility,
is operated under a lease with the Indianapolis Airport Authority that
expires in 2031.&#160; The Indianapolis Maintenance Center occupies 300
acres of land, 1,690,000 square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar
docks.
</p><p>United also leases a major facility at the Oakland, California airport,
dedicated to widebody airframe maintenance.&#160; The Oakland facility
occupies 44 acres of land, 380,000 square feet of floor space and has four
aircraft hangar docks.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United's off-airport leased
properties have included a number of ticketing, sales and general office
space in the downtown and outlying areas of most of the larger cities comprised
in the United system. As part of its restructuring and cost containment
efforts, United has closed, terminated or rejected all of its city ticket
office leases. United continues to lease and operate a number of general
office, reservations, sales and other support facilities.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002, approximately
$1.7 billion in special facilities revenue bonds ("municipal bonds") originally
issued on behalf of United to build or improve airport-related facilities
were outstanding. The Company leases facilities at airports pursuant to
lease agreements where municipal bonds funded at least some of its airport-related
projects. Pursuant to the financing agreements entered into by United in
connection with such issuance of municipal bonds, the Company is required
to make payments in amounts sufficient to pay the interest semi-annually
with principal payable upon maturity.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United is not permitted under
the Bankruptcy Code to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt without
providing notice to its creditors and receiving the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court. As United has been advised its municipal bonds are unsecured (or
in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt, United cannot
make payments thereon without first meeting the requirements outlined above.Accordingly,
the Company has classified all of its municipal bonds as liabilities subject
to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code requires that the Company timely perform all of its post-petition
obligations under unexpired leases of non-residential real property. The
Company believes that it is in compliance with all payment obligations
under its lease agreements relating to those airports where it has municipal
bonds outstanding. Under certain of the airport lease agreements, however,
the Company may be considered in default due to the non-payment of the
debt and therefore subject to the default provisions of the lease agreements
with the airports. Possible consequences could include loss of the Company's
status as a signatory airline (resulting in increased rents and landing
fees) and loss of the Company's exclusive space agreement.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company did not pay certain
rental and landing fees when first due on December 1, 2002 under its airport
use agreement with the City of Chicago with respect to the Chicago O'Hare
International Airport. By letter to the Company dated December 4, 2002,
Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago asserted that the Company may
have forfeited its exclusive rights to its premises at O'Hare on account
of the Company's non-payment of such rental and landing fees. By letter
to Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago on December 5, 2002, the
Company confirmed that it had paid, by wire transfer, on December 5, 2002,
the full payment of outstanding rental and landing fee obligations at O'Hare
and that such payment constituted a cure of any delinquency or default
and that the Company's rights under such lease remain unaffected. Likewise,
by letter to Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago on December 6,
2002, the Company reiterated its position that the December 5<sup>th</sup>
payment represented a cure of any rental delinquencies or defaults and
that the City's attempt to modify the Company's exclusive rights was ineffective.
A difference of opinion remains as to whether the City of Chicago's attempt
to change the exclusive nature of the premises at O'Hare has any legal
effect.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company did not make
the debt service payments due March 1, 2003 of approximately $3.2 million
on its Chicago O'Hare Series 1999A Bonds and of approximately $1.0 million
on its Miami-Dade Series 2000 Bonds. Additionally, the Company does not
intend to make debt service payments or any other payment due on or after
April 1, 2003 on any of the municipal bond issuances, which include those
referenced above, issued on behalf of the Company and relating to domestic
airport financings.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company filed a Complaint
Of Debtor For Declaratory Judgment with the Bankruptcy Court on February
28, 2003 and entered into a Standstill Agreement with the City of Chicago
to seek clarification of its obligations under the municipal bonds and
to protect its rights under its airport lease agreement at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport until the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits of
the complaint.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On March 21, 2003, the Company
filed other Complaints of Debtor for Declaratory Judgment and, in connection
therewith, corresponding Motions for Temporary Restraining Order with respect
to the municipal bonds issuances relating to the facilities at the Denver
International Airport, the New York City - John F. Kennedy International
Airport, the San Francisco International Airport, and the Los Angeles International
Airport, each seeking a clarification of the Company's obligations under
the applicable municipal bonds, and the protection of its rights under
its underlying airport lease agreements at the applicable airport until
the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits of each of the above complaints.
On March 27, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court conducted a hearing on this issue.&#160;
At that time, the Bankruptcy Court continued the matter until March 31,
2003.&#160; The parties are attempting to negotiate an order that protects
the Company's rights under its leases by requiring the lessors to give
additional notice of certain alledged defaults.&#160; The Company is unable
to predict what, if any, action might be taken in the future by either
the bondholders or the airport authorities as a result of its failure to
pay these obligations as contractually required
<br/>&#160;
</p><p><b>ITEM 3.&#160; LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.</b>
</p><p><b><u>In re: UAL Corporation, et. al.</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>As discussed above,
on the Petition Date, UAL, the Company and 26 other direct and indirect
wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court.&#160;
The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption "In
re UAL Corporation, et al., Case Nos. 02-B-48191 through 02-B-48218."&#160;
As debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are authorized under Chapter 11 to
continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may not engage in transactions
outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the
Bankruptcy Court.&#160; As of the Petition Date, virtually all pending
litigation (including some of the actions described below) is stayed, and
absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject to certain
exceptions, may take any action, again subject to certain exceptions, to
recover on pre-petition claims against the Debtors.&#160; In addition,
Debtors may reject pre-petition executory contracts and unexpired lease
obligations, and parties affected by these rejections may file claims with
the Bankruptcy Court.&#160; At this time, it is not possible to predict
the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases or their effect on the Company's business.
</p><p><b><u>Frank, et al. v. United; EEOC v. United</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A class action lawsuit against
United was filed on February 7, 1992 in federal district court in California,
alleging that United's former flight attendant weight program, in effect
from 1989 to 1994, unlawfully discriminated against flight attendants on
the grounds of sex, age and other factors, and seeking monetary relief.&#160;
On April 29, 1994, the class was certified as to the sex and age claims.
Following extensive motion practice, on March 10, 1998, the district court
dismissed all the claims against United.&#160; Following an appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a three-judge panel of the
Ninth Circuit, on June 21, 2000, overturned the ruling.&#160; The court
ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law
on their claims for discrimination based on sex and that a trial was required
for determination on their claims for age discrimination.&#160; In addition,
the appellate court reversed the dismissal of all individual class representative
claims of discrimination and the case was remanded to the district court
for further proceedings.&#160; United's petition before the U.S. Supreme
Court was rejected.&#160; Prior to United's Chapter 11 filing, the parties
settled the case to enable plaintiffs to establish the size of their unsecured
claim.&#160; The automatic stay resulting from United's Chapter 11 filing
will be lifted to allow the court to conduct proceedings to allow the finalization
of the settlement as to the class.
</p><p><b><u>Hall d.b.a. Travel Specialists v. United</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A North Carolina travel agent
filed an antitrust class action suit against United (and other carriers)
initially in state court and then in federal court in North Carolina following
the reduction by United (and other carriers) in November 1999 of commission
rates payable to travel agents. Plaintiffs allege that United and the other
carrier-defendants conspired to fix travel agent commissions in violation
of the Sherman Act and seek treble damages and injunctive relief. Subsequent
to this initial filing, the case has been expanded by the addition of five
new travel agencies, ARTA, and eight new carrier defendants, including
two Star Alliance carriers. In addition, the court has allowed the addition
of claims related to carriers' commission reduction actions in 1997, 1998,
2001, and 2002. Earlier this year the Court granted plaintiffs' motion
to certify the case as a class action consisting of all U.S. (and its possessions)
travel agencies. Plaintiffs have claimed lost commissions, assuming liability,
in the amount of approximately $13 billion, although United's alleged share
of this amount has not been determined by plaintiffs. Upon UAL's Chapter
11 filing, this case was stayed as against United. Since that date, all
remaining defendants have moved for summary judgment. Those motions are
pending before the court.&#160; Trial has been set for September 2, 2003.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition to the Hall case,
United has been named in several other cases filed in the U.S. and Canada,
involving commission rates payable to travel agencies. These cases are
in their early stages. United does not expect the outcome of Hall and the
related cases to have any material effect upon United's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
</p><p><b><u>Litigation Associated with September 11 Terrorism</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Approximately 40 lawsuits
have been served on United in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York related to the September 11 terrorist attacks.&#160;
The suits seek a variety of recoveries, including wrongful death, injury
or property damage, and claim that United and others breached their duty
of care to the passengers and to the ground victims.&#160; A number of
lawsuits have also been filed against American and other defendants.&#160;
Under federal law, United's liability on such claims will be limited to
the amount of United's insurance coverage.&#160; United anticipates the
filing of other lawsuits related to the September 11 attacks in the future.&#160;
Also, a forum was created under federal law to provide, as an alternative
to litigation, an administrative avenue for the payment of compensation
to victims of the terror attacks. United has stipulated that the automatic
stay applicable to these lawsuits under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code will be
lifted for 60 days to permit United's participation in a motion to dismiss
the claims of the ground victims.

<p><b><u>Chapter 11 Reorganization</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On December 9, 2002, the
Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, Eastern Division, in Chicago. For further details
regarding the bankruptcy filing, see "Bankruptcy Considerations" under
Item 1.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On the Petition Date, the
Bankruptcy Court gave interim approval for an aggregate of up to $1.5 billion
in DIP Financing. The DIP Financing is structured as a $300 million facility
from Bank One, NA (the "Bank One Facility") and a $1.2 billion facility
provided by a group led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank
One, NA and The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. (the "Club Facility").&#160;
The Company has received commitments of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility
following the completion of the syndication process for that facility;
the balance is conditioned upon the participation of one or more additional
lenders, subject to approval by the existing participants.&#160; The Company
currently has access to the entire Bank One Facility and to $500 million
of the Club Facility. Access to the balance of the Club Facility is subject
to specified terms of that facility.&#160; These terms require that the
Company achieve performance milestones under its business plan, which include
substantial cost savings in the near term.&#160; Final approval of the
DIP Financing was granted by the Bankruptcy Court on December 30, 2002.
For more information on the DIP Financing, see Note 1, "Proceedings Under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In order to exit Chapter
11 successfully, the Company will need to propose, and obtain confirmation
by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would resolve,
among other things, the Debtors' pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for
its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy. The timing
of filing a plan of reorganization by the Company will depend on the timing
and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases.
Although the Company expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides
for its emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance
at this time that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court, or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under Section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically stays
most actions against a debtor, including most actions to collect pre-petition
indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the debtor's estate.&#160;
Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition
liabilities are subject to settlement under the plan of reorganization.&#160;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtors' rights to possess and operate
certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related
equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional
sale contract are governed by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code ("Section
1110") that specifies different treatment. For further information on Section
1110 and its impact on the Company, see "Properties - Flight Equipment"
under Item 2 and Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</u>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject
certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real
property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the
Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions.&#160; In general, rejection
of an unexpired lease or executory contract is treated as a pre-petition
breach of the lease or contract in question. Subject to certain exceptions,
this rejection relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations
under that lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty
to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by the deemed
breach.&#160; Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code specified particular
treatment of collective bargaining agreements ("CBAs") which a debtor may
move to reject if the debtor first satisfies a number of statutorily prescribed
substantive and procedural prerequisites and obtains the Bankruptcy Court's
approval of the rejection. See "Employees - Labor Matters" under Item 1
and "Labor Agreements" below for further information.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At this time, it is not possible
to predict accurately the effect of the Chapter 11 reorganization process
on the Company's business or when it may emerge from Chapter 11.&#160;
The Company's future results depend on the timely and successful confirmation
and implementation of a plan of reorganization. The rights and claims of
various creditors and security holders will be determined by the plan as
well.&#160; No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be
ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies,
and it is possible that UAL's equity or UAL's or the Company's other securities
will be restructured in a manner that will reduce substantially or eliminate
any remaining value. Accordingly, the Company urges that appropriate caution
be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any of
such securities and claims.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On February 24, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court entered a preliminary injunction in order to restrict
the trading of UAL's common stock and debt interests in UAL or the Company.
The purpose of the preliminary injunction was to ensure that the Company
did not lose the benefit of its net operating loss ("NOL"). Under federal
and state income tax law, an NOL can be used to offset future taxable income,
and thus is an extremely valuable asset. However, a company can lose the
benefit of its NOLs if the company is deemed to undergo an "ownership change"
under certain very specific tax rules in the Internal Revenue Code. Excessive
trading in a company's stock (or debt when the company is in bankruptcy)
can trigger such an "ownership change," and thus the Company sought to
restrict the trading of UAL's common stock and debt interests.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the terms of the preliminary
injunction, no person can buy or sell UAL stock if that person holds more
than 4.8 million shares of UAL common stock or would hold more than 4.8
million shares after the purchase. Any person who holds more than $200
million in debt claims against UAL must register as a "substantial claimholder"
with UAL, and no person may acquire debt claims against UAL if the acquisition
of the claims would cause them to hold more than $200 million in such claims.
See Note 6, "Income Taxes" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with SOP 90-7 and
on a going-concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations,
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course
of business.&#160; However, as a result of the Debtors' Chapter 11 filing,
such realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities, without substantial
adjustments or changes in ownership, are subject to uncertainty.&#160;
While operating as debtors-in-possession under the protection of Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code and subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court
or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business, the Debtors
may sell or otherwise dispose of assets, or liquidate and settle liabilities,
for some amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial
statements.&#160; Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change
the amounts and classifications in the historical financial statements.
</p><p><b><u>Results of Operations</u></b>
</p><p><b>Summary of Results -</b>
<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The air travel business
is subject to seasonal fluctuations. United's operations are often adversely
impacted by winter weather and United's first- and fourth-quarter results
normally reflect reduced travel demand. Historically, operating results
are better in the second and third quarters. The events of September 11
and the downturn in the U.S. economy distorted the normal seasonal relationships
in 2001 and 2002. As a result of the U.S. war with Iraq, the typical seasonal
fluctuations may continue to be disrupted in 2003.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2000, the Company
experienced significant operational disruptions, as a result of labor-related
delays and cancellations, as well as weather and air traffic control limitations,
which adversely affected both revenue and expense performance. The Company
attempted to mitigate the impact of these operational difficulties by reducing
capacity, particularly in the domestic markets, where most of the problems
were concentrated. The Company estimated the revenue shortfall arising
from these disruptions and associated schedule reductions and cancellations
to be somewhere between $700 and $750 million for the year.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Additionally, beginning
in early 2001, the weakening U.S. economy had a significant impact on the
airline industry as corporations reduced their business travel budgets
and changed their travel behavior. During the first six months of 2001,
the industry began experiencing significant revenue declines as a result
of the decrease in business traffic, which impacted both unit revenues
and yields, particularly in the domestic markets. United's domestic passenger
revenue was down $728 million (12%) in the first six months of 2001 compared
to the same period in 2000, partially driven from a 4% domestic capacity
reduction and a 15% decline in business revenues. Domestic unit revenue
was down 8% from 2000. Domestic business revenue was down $631 million
(15%) in the first six months of 2001, driven by a 13% decline in volume
and a 2% decline in yield.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Historically, there
has been a strong correlation between airline revenues and GDP and corporate
profitability. As corporate profitability dropped during this period, companies
reduced spending on travel. During this period, approximately 65% to 75%
of United's domestic revenues were derived from business travelers, which
resulted in United being disproportionately affected by this decline as
compared to some of United's competitors who rely less heavily on business
travelers.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 had a significant negative impact on passenger and cargo
demand for air travel. In a direct response to the adverse impact on air
travel as a result of the terrorist attacks, United reduced its capacity
by 23% based on system-wide available seat miles compared to levels prior
to September 11. This schedule reduction allowed for the early retirement
of the entire B727-200 and B737-200 fleets in 2001. Additionally, United
began the process of furloughing approximately 20,000 employees. During
the fourth quarter 2001, United restructured its aircraft delivery program
with both The Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie to defer deliveries of
new aircraft for 2002 and 2003 from the 67 originally planned to 24 aircraft.
United took delivery of 24 of an original 49 aircraft scheduled for the
year 2002 and will not take delivery of any of the 18 aircraft originally
scheduled for 2003. The remaining 43 aircraft have been deferred into 2004
and beyond. United's future schedule will vary as the Company reacts to
continuing changes in demand and yields, as well as normal factors such
as seasonality and fleet composition.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As part of the Air
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the "Act")
enacted in response to the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government
made $5.0 billion in federal grants available to the airline industry.
The Company received a total of $782 million in grants under the Act. This
amount represents the Company's total allocation of grant money under the
Act and is recorded as non-operating income in the <u>Statements of Consolidated
Operations</u>. For further discussion of the impact of the attacks, the
Company's response and the Act on the Company's financial statements, see
Note 3, "Special Charges" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Throughout 2002, the
Company continued to suffer from the weakened revenue environment resulting
from the events of September 11 and the weak U.S. economy. In early 2002,
year-over-year unit revenues had been improving each month from a 14% decline
in January to a 4% decline in May; however, unit revenue growth stalled
in the third and fourth quarters as demand continued to be weak and yields
declined. Industry revenues continue to remain below 1995 levels and United,
in particular, has experienced declines in domestic unit revenue that are
below industry levels. United's unit revenue for 2002 decreased 4% from
the prior year and yields have declined 8% year-over-year.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United's loss from operations
was $(3.0) billion in 2002, compared to $(3.7) billion in 2001. United's
net loss for 2002 was $(3.3) billion, compared to $(2.1) billion before
the cumulative effect of an accounting change in 2001.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The 2002 results include
a special charge of $67 million recorded in connection with severance related
to furloughs. Additionally, the Company recorded a gain of $46 million
on the sale of its investment in Cendant Corporation and recognized $130
million in non-operating income as compensation under the Act. During 2002,
the Company also had a 0% effective tax rate, as compared to recognizing
a $1.2 billion tax credit in 2001.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2001, United recorded
a special charge of $1.3 billion in operating expense and $49 million in
non-operating expense for amounts relating to the September 11 terrorist
attacks and the resulting impact on the Company's schedule and operations.
In addition, through December 31, United has recognized $652 million in
non-operating income as compensation under the Act. The Company also recorded
a gain of $261 million on the sale of certain investments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Each of the above special
charges and gains on sales are described more fully in Note 3, "Special
Charges," Note 6, "Income Taxes" and Note 7, "Investments" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p><b>2002 Compared with 2001</b> -
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Operating Revenues.</i></b>
Operating revenues decreased $2.2 billion (13%) and United's revenue per
available seat mile (unit revenue) decreased 4% from 9.76 cents to 9.35
cents. Passenger revenues decreased $1.9 billion (14%) due to a 6% decrease
in revenue passenger miles and an 8% decrease in yield. United's available
seat miles across the system decreased 10% from 2001; however, passenger
load factor increased 2.7 points to 73.5%. The following analysis by market
is based on information reported to the DOT:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Cargo revenues decreased
$31 million (4%) due primarily to a 5% decrease in cargo ton miles, as
cargo yields remained flat year over year. Other operating revenues decreased
$224 million (14%) primarily due to the transfer of revenues from the sale
of Mileage Plus miles to ULS as well as a decrease in fuel sales to third
parties.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Operating Expenses.</i></b>
Operating expenses decreased $1.7 billion (9%) and United's cost per available
seat mile (unit cost) increased 0.8% from 11.24 cents to 11.33 cents, excluding
special charges. Salaries and related costs decreased $70 million (1%)
as the impact of furloughing employees was partially offset by contractually
driven salary and benefit enhancements as well as increases to pension
and postretirement expense. Aircraft fuel decreased $555 million (22%)
on a 14% decrease in consumption and a 10% decrease in fuel price. Purchased
services decreased $332 million (19%) primarily as a result of volume-driven
decreases in GDS (global distribution systems) and credit card discount
fees. Depreciation and amortization decreased $73 million (7%) primarily
due to retirements of older aircraft. Aircraft maintenance decreased $141
million (20%) due to retirements of older aircraft and a decrease in engine
and aircraft repair volumes as a result of reduced flying. Commissions
decreased $291 million (40%) as a result of United discontinuing paying
base commissions on all tickets purchased in the U.S. and Canada, effective
March 20, 2002, as well as a decrease in commissionable revenues. Other
operating expenses decreased $177 million (10%) due to decreases in crew
layover expenses and volume-driven food and beverage costs, offset by increased
costs for hull and liability insurance of approximately $100 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Other income (expense).</i></b>
Other non-operating expense amounted to $481 million in 2002 compared to
$443 million in 2001, excluding special charges, reorganization items,
gains on sales and the airline stabilization grant. Interest expense increased
$61 million (11%) due to new debt issuances and increased borrowing rates.
Interest capitalized decreased $54 million (68%) primarily as a result
of lower advance payments outstanding towards future aircraft purchases.
Interest income increased $18 million (19%) due primarily from interest
earned from ULS in 2002. Miscellaneous, net decreased $64 million (77%)
primarily as a result of lower reserve requirements for legal and environmental
costs.
</p><p><b>2001 Compared with 2000 -</b>
<br/><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Operating Revenues.&#160;</i></b>
Operating revenues decreased $3.2 billion (17%) and United's revenue per
available seat mile (unit revenue) decreased 11% from 11.02 cents to 9.76
cents. Passenger revenues decreased $3.1 billion (19%) due to an 8% decrease
in revenue passenger miles and an 11% decrease in yield. United's available
seat miles across the system decreased 6% from 2000 which, combined with
the decrease in revenue passenger miles, resulted in a decrease to passenger
load factor of 1.5 points to 70.8%. The following analysis by market is
based on information reported to the DOT:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Cargo revenues decreased
$227 million (24%) due to a 24% decrease in cargo ton miles largely as
a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as the discontinuation
of freighter operations in the fourth quarter 2000. Other operating revenues
grew $127 million (9%) primarily due to a $161 million increase in fuel
sales to third parties.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Operating Expenses.
</i></b>Operating
expenses decreased $35 million (0.2%) and United's cost per available seat
mile (unit cost) increased 6%, from 10.58 cents to 11.24 cents, excluding
special charges. Salaries and related costs increased $168 million (2%)
due to routine annual salary increases for non-contract employees, contractually
driven increases for employees represented by ALPA and the estimated costs
of contracts with the IAM, which were partially offset by the reduction
in force implemented after September 11. Commissions decreased $296 million
(29%) as a result of a decrease in commissionable revenues and a change
to the commission structure implemented in August 2001, which reduced the
cap paid on commissions issued in the U.S. for domestic travel from $50
for a round-trip ticket ($25 for a one-way ticket) to $20 and $10, respectively.
Aircraft rent decreased $62 million (7%) as the retirement of older aircraft
reduced the number of aircraft under operating leases. Landing fees and
other rent increased $44 million (5%) primarily due to increased rates
at various airports. Depreciation and amortization increased $33 million
(3%) due to an increase in the number of owned aircraft. Cost of sales
increased $185 million (17%) primarily due to costs associated with fuel
sales to third parties.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Other income (expense).</i></b>
Other non-operating expense amounted to $443 million in 2001 compared to
$296 million in 2000, excluding special charges, gains on sales and the
airline stabilization grant. Interest expense increased $124 million (30%)
as a result of new debt issuances.
</p><p><b><u>Liquidity and Capital Resources</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The matters described
in "Liquidity and Capital Resources," to the extent that they relate to
future events or expectations, may be significantly affected by the Chapter
11 Cases. Those proceedings will involve, or may result in, various restrictions
on the Company's activities, limitations on financing, the need to obtain
Bankruptcy Court and Creditor's Committee approval for various matters
and uncertainty as to relationships with vendors, suppliers, customers
and others with whom the Company may conduct or seek to conduct business.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Generally, under the Bankruptcy
Code, most of a debtor's liabilities must be satisfied in full before the
debtor's stockholders can receive any distribution on account of such shares.
The rights and claims of the Company's various creditors and security holders
will be determined by any plan of reorganization filed by UAL.&#160; Further,
it is also likely that pre-petition unsecured claims against the Company
will be substantially impaired in connection with the Company's reorganization.
No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed in
the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies, and it is possible
that UAL's equity or other securities will be restructured in a manner
that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value.
</p><p><b>Liquidity -</b>
<br/><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>United's total
of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted
cash (both short- and long-term), was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002,
compared to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2001. Cash flows used in operations
amounted to $1.4 billion, including the receipt of $130 million in government
grant money.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Property additions,
including aircraft and aircraft spare parts, amounted to $887 million,
including $733 million of vendor-financed purchases. During 2002, United
took delivery of eight A319, twelve A320 and four B777 aircraft. All of
these aircraft were purchased. United also acquired one B757 and nine B737
aircraft off lease during the same period. Additionally, ten owned aircraft
were sold and then leased back under operating leases during the year.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Financing activities
during 2002 included principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations
of $1.3 billion and $220 million, respectively. During 2002, United closed
on a $775 million private debt financing which refinanced certain aircraft
and raised approximately $250 million in additional cash. United also arranged
long-term financing for approximately $314 million in debt that had been
placed in interim financing facilities and refinanced $238 million in long-term
debt through a sale-leaseback transaction that raised approximately $72
million in additional cash. Additionally, United repaid $133 million in
receivables-backed short-term borrowings when certain banks supporting
the borrowing program declined to renew it. In December 2002, United borrowed
$700 million under the DIP Financing.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In June 2002, United
repaid $34 million to the State of Indiana, on behalf of the various parties
to the agreements, for failure to reach its capital targets in connection
with the construction of the Indianapolis Maintenance Center. In addition,
in December 2002, the Company paid $59 million in retroactive pay plus
accrued interest to IAM-represented employees.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2002, the Company
received approximately $580 million, net, in income tax refunds, part of
which was a result of changes in the tax laws. In addition, United paid
$290 million in federal transportation taxes that had been deferred under
the Act after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Also in 2002, the Company
received $137 million in proceeds from the sale of its Cendant Corporation
stock and $130 million in compensation under the Act. In the third quarter
of 2002, the Company received approximately $113 million in cash which
had been held in trust under a services agreement with Galileo International
(now Cendant Corporation).
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December 31,
2002, the Company had $566 million in restricted cash (including $116 million
in long-term restricted cash) on deposit with various state and local governments.
The cash largely represents security for worker compensation obligations
in states where United self-insures, security deposits for airport leases
and reserves with institutions which process the Company's sales. Prior
to 2002, United met many of these obligations through surety bonds or a
secured letter of credit facility; however, many of the bonds have been
cancelled and the letter of credit facility expired in August of 2002.
As a result, United has been and may, in the future, be required to post
additional collateral in the form of cash deposits to support these types
of obligations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United's liability insurance
for losses resulting from war perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and
other similar perils) was cancelled effective September 26, 2001. United
obtained replacement coverage, although it was charged significantly higher
premiums for this replacement coverage which was in a substantially reduced
amount for claims not involving aircraft passengers. Additionally, the
FAA began providing supplemental third-party war risk insurance coverage
to commercial carriers for renewable 60-day periods for levels of coverage
not available in the market, which United also obtained.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In November 2002, Congress
passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which required the FAA to provide
third party, passenger and hull war risk insurance through August 31, 2003.
This insurance may be extended to December 31, 2003, subject to the federal
government's determination that such coverage is necessary to the national
interest. There can be no assurance, however, that the FAA insurance will
continue to be available. Should the FAA discontinue this coverage, obtaining
replacement insurance from commercial underwriters could result in substantially
higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if it is available at all.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United did not make
any cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan trusts for U.S.
based employees in 2001 or 2002. In lieu of making cash contributions,
the Company utilized a portion of its credit balance (the cumulative difference
between prior year minimum required contributions and actual contributions)
to meet the minimum required contribution. The Company has a remaining
credit balance that is available to be used in 2003; however, once the
credit balance is fully utilized, substantial contributions may be required.
The Company currently estimates, based on current market conditions and
benefit plans, that it could be required to contribute approximately $5.5
billion to its defined benefit pension plan trusts over the next few years.
However, future funding requirements are dependent upon factors such as
interest rate levels, funded status, regulatory requirements for funding
purposes and the level and timing of asset returns as compared with the
level and timing of expected benefit disbursements. In addition, the Company
is seeking to revise its pension plans, as discussed in "Labor Agreements"
below, which would also impact future funding requirements. As such, it
is not possible to be more specific with respect to required contributions
and actual future contributions may differ materially. As of December 31,
2002, United's defined benefit pension plans were in compliance with all
U.S. government funding requirements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In conjunction with
the ratification of the contracts for the IAM, the Company has provided
collateral consisting of certain real estate, flight simulators, ground
equipment and spare part assets to support the payment of approximately
$520 million in retroactive wages due under the contracts in eight quarterly
installments commencing December 2002. In December 2002, the Company made
the first payment required under the contract and is currently seeking
release of the additional collateral.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result of the
bankruptcy filing, S&amp;P downgraded United's senior unsecured debt to
D. In August 2002, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its credit
ratings on United's senior unsecured debt from Caa1 to Ca. Downgrades of
the Company's credit ratings during 2002 have resulted in an increase of
$2 million in interest expense for the year.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002,
commitments for the purchase of property and equipment, principally aircraft,
approximated $1.6 billion, after deducting advance payments. Of this amount,
an estimated $0.1 billion is expected to be spent in 2003. For further
details, see Note 15, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p><b>Capital Commitments -</b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>The Company's business
is very capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to
fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. United has, in the
past, funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by
issuing debt, or by entering into capital or operating leases. Similarly,
the Company often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports
to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other similar facilities.
As can be seen in the table below, these operating lease commitments (which
are sometimes referred to as "off-balance sheet debt") are significant.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Following is a summary of
the Company's material contractual cash obligations as of December 31,
2002:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result of the
bankruptcy filing, the Company is not permitted to make any payments on
its pre-petition debt and therefore, the amounts have been excluded from
the above table. In addition, as discussed in Note 1, "Proceedings under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code" and Note 11, "Lease Obligations" in
the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>, the Company may
assume, assume and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired
leases pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, the Company anticipates
that its lease obligations as currently detailed in the above table will
change significantly in the future.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The pension obligations as
of December 31, 2002 are based on the Company's current pension assumptions
and current labor contracts. Thus, they assume no permanent wage concessions
are achieved, nor any changes to the Company's pension benefit plans are
implemented and that no waivers have been obtained from the government
to spread the minimum cash contributions for pensions over a longer period.
If these changes are effected in the future, the Company's pension funding
obligations could be reduced by approximately $1.9 billion over this same
period.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; See Note 10, "Long-Term Debt,"
Note 11, "Lease Obligations" and Note 15, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities

</i></b>The
DIP Financing consists of two facilities, the Bank One Facility for $300
million and the Club Facility for $1.2 billion. The Company has received
commitments of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility following the completion
of the syndication process for that facility; the balance is conditioned
upon the participation of one or more additional lenders, subject to approval
by the existing participants.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Bank One Facility
consists of a $300 million term loan with an interest rate option of the
prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%). As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $300 million at the LIBOR
option which is due in five equal monthly installments beginning in March
2004.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Club Facility consists
of a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of $800 million and
a term loan of $400 million, which matures on July 1, 2004. The Company
has the option of borrowing under the Club Facility at an interest rate
of the prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%).
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $400 million under the
term loan at the LIBOR option. In addition, the Company had available a
$100 million letter of credit facility that was drawn down in March 2003.
The remaining $700 million under the revolving credit facility is subject
to stringent availability hurdles as discussed below.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The terms of the DIP
Financing include covenants that require the Company to satisfy monthly
ongoing financial requirements as determined by EBITDAR (earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rents)
and covenants that limit, among other things, the Debtors' ability to borrow
additional money, make capital expenditures and make additional corporate
investments. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a minimum
unrestricted cash balance, excluding escrowed amounts, of $300 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the Club Facility,
borrowing availability is determined by a formula based on a percentage
of eligible assets. The eligible assets consist of certain previously unencumbered
aircraft, spare engines, spare parts inventory, certain flight simulators
and quick engine change kits. The underlying value of such assets may fluctuate
periodically due to prevailing market conditions and fluctuations in value
may have an impact on the borrowing availability under the Club Facility.
Availability may be further limited by additional reserves imposed by the
banks in their commercially reasonable discretion.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The remaining $700
million of availability under the Club Facility, subject to the limitation
on borrowing availability discussed above, will be available to the Company
after certain conditions are met, including achieving positive cumulative
EBITDAR; submitting a certified updated business plan; providing updated
appraisals on the collateral and ascertaining there has been no material
adverse change with respect to transferability of routes, gate leaseholds
or slots.
</p><p><b><u>Other Information</u></b>
</p><p><b>Plan for Transformation -</b>
<br/><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>During the
first quarter of 2003, the Company presented to its Board of Directors
and employees information regarding the plan for transformation (the "Plan"),
which outlines the fundamental changes to United's strategic direction.
The Plan, which the Company is working to refine through further collaboration
with its employee and creditor constituencies, seeks to develop a durable
and sustainable business model that will lay the foundation for a company
that is successful and competitive for the long run.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Core objectives of
the Plan are the reduction of United's labor and non-labor costs and the
development of a more comprehensive and compelling portfolio of products.
The Plan is intended to leverage United's strengths, including its industry-leading
global route network, substantial, well-situated hubs and large and loyal
customer base, including its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program. Key operational
elements of the plan include: (1) the preservation and enhancement of United's
extensive mainline service targeted primarily at the business traveler;
(2) the creation of a low-cost offering to compete directly with low-cost
carriers for leisure and price-sensitive travelers; (3) the growth of the
Company's United Express regional operations and (4) the expansion of United's
domestic and international alliances.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Through the Plan, the
Company must:
</p><ul>
<li>
reduce costs and develop a business model that builds credibility with
the financial and investment community to ensure that United has access
to capital to emerge from Chapter 11;</li>
<li>
create clear and compelling value for customers;</li>
<li>
maintain and build on United's strong global network by creating a competitive
portfolio of products that allows United to continue to serve our core
business customer, yet offers additional value to cost-conscious fliers
and addresses the threat from low-cost carriers; and</li>
<li>
deliver value to employees in a fundamentally changed industry environment.</li>
</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company has already began
making cost reductions through a comprehensive restructuring program that
includes:
<ul>
<li>
reducing union labor costs through interim wage reductions as discussed
below in "Labor Agreements;"</li>
<li>
reducing salaried and management costs by $250 million in 2003 through
wage reductions implemented in December 2002, headcount reductions effective
January 2003 and proposed benefit changes;</li>
<li>
identifying business transformation initiatives that involve strategic
projects, such as the US Airways code share, and a systematic cost reduction
program to increase revenues and lower costs by over $1 billion in 2003
and $1.4 billion in 2004;</li>
<li>
renegotiating aircraft lease and mortgage agreements for approximately
$500 million in estimated savings by 2005; and</li>
<li>
reducing capacity by 6% in 2003 and closing all U.S. city ticket offices
and certain reservation call centers</li>
</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Additionally, in 2003,
the Company has implemented an additional across-the-board reduction to
cut costs by targeting such areas as overhead staffing, food and beverage
costs and technology spending. The Company has also begun a "best practices"
program designed to examine every area of the Company and implement more
efficient practices. This program is expected to result in an additional
$400 million in cost reductions by 2005.
<p><b>Labor Agreements -</b>
<br/><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>In order to
meet
the EBITDAR covenant under the DIP Financing, United needed to obtain substantial
labor savings from its employees by mid-February 2003. Therefore, the Company
imposed immediate wage reductions of between 3% and 11% on its management
and salaried employees, including officers in December 2002. Additionally,
United immediately began negotiations with all of its unions in early December
regarding the changes to the Company's CBAs necessary to satisfy United's
short-term and long-term financial and business imperatives. The Company's
proposed changes to its CBAs involve targeted cost savings of $2.56 billion
annually on a cash basis compared to the current contractual path. These
cost savings are expected to be realized through wage rate reductions,
work rule modifications and reduced benefit levels.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the event the parties
cannot reach consensual modifications, Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code permits the Company to move to reject its CBAs. Under Section 1113(c),
the Company must satisfy several statutorily prescribed substantive and
procedural prerequisites before the Bankruptcy Court will authorize the
Company to reject its CBAs. In order to meet the deadline for reducing
its labor costs and avoid being in default under the terms of the DIP Financing,
United had been prepared to file a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to
Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code by December 26, 2002, if consensual
CBA modifications could not be reached before that date.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As the December 26
deadline neared, however, United and several of its unions agreed to consensual
interim wage relief from its unions that would allow United and its unions
more time to continue negotiations to reach agreements on the CBA modifications
necessary for United to successfully reorganize while still meeting the
short-term financial imperatives established by the DIP covenants in the
meantime. United reached agreements with four of its five unions to reduce
wages on an interim basis, effective January 1, 2003 to April 30, 2003,
resulting in a reduction to wages for ALPA-represented employees of 29%,
AFA-represented employees of 9% and PAFCA and TWU-represented employees
of 13%. The leadership of the IAM rejected the Company's proposal and therefore,
on December 27, 2002, United filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to
impose a 13% wage reduction for the IAM-represented employees. On January
10, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Company's motion and the Company
effectively reduced IAM-represented employee wages by 13% (14% from wages
earned after January 10, 2003). These wage reductions, combined with the
wage reductions for the Company's salaried and management employees, are
expected to result in cost savings of approximately $70 million per month
through April 2003.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the terms of
the interim agreements with its unions, and the relief granted by the Bankruptcy
Court against the IAM, United agreed not to file a motion to reject its
CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) before March 15, 2003. In the meantime,
United and its unions continued negotiations. The Company's DIP covenants,
however, still require United to obtain all of the relief sought in its
proposed CBA modifications by May 1, 2003. As a result, on March 17, 2003,
United filed a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) and
make permanent the interim wage relief it received from unionized employees
in January. March 17 was the deadline by which such a motion needed to
be filed to ensure that the Company could obtain a ruling on its motion
by early May 2003 and stay in compliance with its DIP Financing covenants.
Without the full relief sought by United's proposed CBA modifications becoming
effective by early May, the Company would be unable to meet its covenants,
entitling its DIP lenders to foreclose on substantial assets United needs
to operate its business.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On March 26,
2003, the Company reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots
Association on a restructured CBA. The agreement, which will become effective
May 1, 2003, if ratified by the pilot membership, has a 6-year duration
and would reduce pay and benefits, and improve productivity (through work
rule changes), by an average of approximately $1.1 billion per year versus
the current contract.&#160; As part of these changes, retirement and medical
benefits for pilots would be reduced through a decrease in the Company's
contribution to the pilot defined contribution plan, a reduction in the
formula for their defined benefit plan, and changes to the medical plan
including increases to co-payments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The tentative agreement
includes a success-sharing program that provides the opportunity for annual
pay-outs tied to the Company's level of profitability and performance.&#160;
The tentative agreement provides for significantly enhanced flexibility
with respect to regional jets, code share arrangements and a low-cost offering.&#160;
Finally, the Company has agreed to include in its plan of reorganization
provisions that pilots would receive a distribution of the equity, securities
or other consideration provided to the general unsecured creditors.&#160;
Additionally, the Company had agreed that any plan of reorganization it
proposes or supports will provide the pilot group with a distribution of
the above-described equity, securities or other consideration (as compared
to the total distribution provided to all employee groups) which matches
the proportion of pilots' contribution to total employee cost reductions.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The pilot contribution
in the tentative agreement represents a significant portion of the overall
labor cost reductions sought by the Company.&#160; Should the Company be
unable to obtain labor cost reductions from any of its union groups (through
consensual agreements or otherwise) which fall below the relief the Company
has articulates as necessary from that group, the Company has agreed to
proportionately reduce ALPA's approximate $1.1 billion contribution.
</p><p><b>US Airways Code Share -</b>
<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On July 24, 2002,
the Company announced a code share agreement with US Airways. The agreement,
which is expected to generate more than $200 million in annual revenue
for United, would allow both carriers to market service on each other's
network, providing significant consumer benefits and bringing new revenue
and customers to their route networks.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United and US Airways
customers have access to each carriers' airport clubs and they are able
to earn and redeem miles on each carriers' frequent flyer program. Additionally,
beginning January 28, 2003, the two carriers began to code share on selected
flights and expect to complete implementation of the code sharing arrangement
by the end of 2003.
</p><p><b>Foreign Operations -</b>
<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United generates revenues
and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies. These expenses include
aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel expense, advertising
and distribution costs, customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact operating income through
changes in foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses.
Despite the adverse (favorable) effects a strengthening (weakening) foreign
currency may have on U.S. originating traffic, a strengthening (weakening)
of foreign currencies tends to increase (decrease) reported revenue and
operating income because United's foreign currency-denominated operating
revenue generally exceeds its foreign currency-denominated operating expense
for each currency.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; With a worldwide network
and significant sales and marketing efforts in the U.S. as well as every
major economic region in the world, United is able to mitigate its exposure
to fluctuations in any single foreign currency. The Company's biggest net
exposures are typically for British pound, Hong Kong dollar, euro and Japanese
yen. The table below sets forth the Company's exposure to various currencies
in 2002:
<br/>&#160;

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To reduce the impact of exchange
rate fluctuations on United's financial results, the Company may hedge
some of the risk of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future
foreign currency revenues by purchasing put options (consisting of Japanese
yen, euro, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds) and
selling Hong Kong dollar forwards. To reduce hedging costs, the Company
sells a correlation option in the first five currencies referred to above.
United also attempts to reduce its exposure to transaction gains and losses
by converting excess local currencies generated to U.S. dollars on a timely
basis and by entering into currency forward or exchange contracts. As a
result of the bankruptcy filing, all swaps and forwards were terminated
by the respective counterparties and the Company's ability to enter into
new swaps or forwards may be limited in the future as a result of the bankruptcy
filing.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United's foreign operations
involve insignificant amounts of physical assets; however, the Company
does have sizable intangible assets related to acquisitions of Atlantic
and Latin America route authorities. Operating authorities in international
markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the U.S.
and foreign countries. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies
can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements
that could adversely impact the value of United's international route authority.
Significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact
on United's operating revenues and results of operations.
</p><p><b>Municipal Bonds</b> -
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002,
approximately $1.7 billion in special facilities revenue bonds ("municipal
bonds") originally issued on behalf of United to build or improve airport-related
facilities were outstanding. The Company leases facilities at airports
pursuant to lease agreements where municipal bonds funded at least some
of its airport-related projects. Pursuant to the financing agreements entered
into by United in connection with such issuance of municipal bonds, the
Company is required to make payments in amounts sufficient to pay the interest
semi-annually with principal payable upon maturity.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United is not permitted
under the Bankruptcy Code to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt
without providing notice to its creditors and receiving the approval of
the Bankruptcy Court. As United has been advised its municipal bonds are
unsecured (or in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt,
United cannot make payments thereon without first meeting the requirements
outlined above.<b> </b>Accordingly, the Company has classified all of its
municipal bonds as liabilities subject to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code requires that the Company timely perform all of its post-petition
obligations under unexpired leases of non-residential real property. The
Company believes that it is in compliance with all payment obligations
under its lease agreements relating to those airports where it has municipal
bonds outstanding. Under certain of the airport lease agreements, however,
the Company may be considered in default due to the non-payment of the
debt and therefore subject to the default provisions of the lease agreements
with the airports. Possible consequences could include loss of the Company's
status as a signatory airline (resulting in increased rents and landing
fees) and loss of the Company's exclusive space agreement.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company did
not make the debt service payments due March 1, 2003 of approximately $3.2
million on its Chicago O'Hare Series 1999A Bonds and of approximately $1.0
million on its Miami-Dade Series 2000 Bonds. Additionally, t<font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">h</font>e
Company does not intend to make debt service payments or any other payment
due on or after April 1, 2003 on any of the municipal bond issuances, which
include those referenced above, issued on behalf of the Company and relating
to domestic airport financings.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company filed a
Complaint Of Debtor For Declaratory Judgment with the Bankruptcy Court
on February 28, 2003 and entered into a Standstill Agreement with the City
of Chicago to seek clarification of its obligations under the municipal
bonds and to protect its rights under its airport lease agreement at Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport until the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits
of the complaint.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On March 21, 2003, the Company
filed other Complaints of Debtor for Declaratory Judgment and, in connection
therewith, corresponding Motions for Temporary Restraining Order with respect
to the municipal bonds issuances relating to the facilities at the Denver
International Airport, the New York City - John F. Kennedy International
Airport, the San Francisco International Airport, and the Los Angeles International
Airport, each seeking a clarification of the Company's obligations under
the applicable municipal bonds, and the protection of its rights under
its underlying airport lease agreements at the applicable airport until
the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits of each of the above complaints.
On March 27, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court conducted a hearing on this issue.&#160;
At that time, the Bankruptcy Court continued the matter until March 31,
2003.&#160; The parties are attempting to negotiate an order that protects
the Company's rights under its leases by requiring the lessors to give
additional notice of certain alledged defaults. The Company is unable to
predict what, if any, action might be taken in the future by either the
bondholders or the airport authorities as a result of its failure to pay
these obligations as contractually required.
</p><p><b>Airport Rents and Landing Fees -</b>
<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United is charged facility
rents and/or landing fees at every airport at which it operates. In recent
years, many airports have increased or sought to increase rates charged
to airlines as a means of compensating for increased demands upon airport
revenues. Airlines have challenged certain of these increases through litigation
and, in some cases, have not been successful. However, to the extent the
limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge
such charges is restricted, the rates charged by airports may increase
substantially. Management cannot predict either the likelihood or the magnitude
of any such increase.
</p><p><b>Environmental and Legal Contingencies -</b>
<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United has been named as
a Potentially Responsible Party at certain Environmental Protection Agency
or State Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA or State EPA") cleanup sites
which have been designated as Superfund Sites. United's alleged proportionate
contributions at the sites are minimal; however, at sites where the EPA
or State EPA have commenced litigation or administrative proceedings, potential
liability is joint and several. Additionally, United has participated and
is participating in remediation actions at certain other sites, primarily
airports. The estimated cost of these actions is accrued when it is determined
that it is probable that United is liable. Environmental regulations and
remediation processes are subject to future change, and determining the
actual cost of remediation will require further investigation and additional
progress of the remediation. Therefore, the ultimate disposition cannot
be determined at this time. However, while such cost may vary from United's
current estimate, United believes the difference between its accrued reserve
and the ultimate liability will not be material.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United has certain other
contingencies resulting from the above environmental actions and other
litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management
believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited
to) the views of legal counsel, the nature of such contingencies and prior
experience, that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not
likely to materially affect United's financial condition, operating results
or liquidity.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result of the
Chapter 11 Filing, as of the Petition Date, virtually all pending litigation
is stayed, and absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, no party,
subject to certain exceptions, may take any action, again subject to certain
exceptions, to recover on pre-petition claims against the Debtors.
</p><p><b>Outstanding Income Tax Claims -</b>
<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company has income
tax refund claims ("Refund") against the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
of $126 million resulting from tax overpayments attributable to the six
years 1988 to 1993 as well as $262 million resulting from a 2002 net operating
loss that has been carried back to and generates a refund for taxes paid
in 1998 and 1999. However, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") had imposed
an "administrative freeze" that prohibited the IRS from remitting any of
the $388 million to the Company. The DOJ action was in response to the
Company's bankruptcy filing and was based on alleged claims of the U.S.
government that might be subject to setoff against the Refund. After discussions
with the DOJ, the Company reached an agreement with the government to lift
the freeze and permit the IRS to process and remit approximately $365 million
of the Refund. On March 27, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement
and the Company anticipates receiving the funds shortly.
</p><p><b>Critical Accounting Policies -</b>
<br/><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Critical accounting
policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments
and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results
under different assumptions and conditions. United has prepared the accompanying
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting
policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Accounting for Long-Lived
Assets.</i></b> The Company has approximately $16 billion in operating
property and equipment at December 31, 2002. In addition to the original
cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy
elections made by the Company, including the estimation of useful lives,
residual values and in 2001, impairment charges.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company records
aircraft at acquisition cost, upon delivery. Depreciable life is determined
by using economic analysis, reviewing existing fleet plans, and comparing
estimated lives to other airlines operating similar fleets. Older generation
aircraft are assigned lives of 25 years which is consistent with the experience
of United and other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved, useful
life has increased. Thus, the Company has estimated the lives of "new generation"
aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on the Company's
historical experience with regards to the sale of both aircraft and spare
parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives
of the aircraft. Residual values are based on current dollars when the
aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not
reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual
values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the Company's fleet
plans and changes in conditions.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company recognizes
an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted
future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is
the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair market value.
Typically, management estimates the undiscounted future cash flows for
its aircraft fleet with models used by the Company in making fleet and
scheduling decisions. These models utilize the Company's projections of
passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors for
the markets where the specific aircraft will operate.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 2001, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of $517 million for the B737-500 and B747-400
aircraft fleets resulting from the anticipated decrease in future cash
flows in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of." (See Note 3, "Special Charges" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.) In the fourth quarter of 2002,
the Company evaluated its fleet in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Utilizing the Company's
current cash flow projections, based on the proposed CBA modifications
and other cost savings as discussed above in "Plan for Transformation"
and "Labor Agreements," and current appraisals of aircraft value, management
determined that no further impairment was necessary.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; See Note 2(f), "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies - Operating Property and Equipment"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u> for additional
information regarding United's policies on accounting for long-lived assets.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Frequent Flyer Accounting.</i></b>
United's Mileage Plus frequent flyer program awards miles to passengers
who fly on United, United Express, the Star Alliance carriers and certain
other airlines that participate in the program. Additionally, United sells
mileage credits to participating airline partners in the Mileage Plus program
and ULS sells mileage credits to non-airline business partners. In either
case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on any airline that
participates in the program. The Company has an obligation to provide this
future travel; therefore, for awards to passengers redeeming on United,
United Express or one of the Mileage Plus partners, the Company recognizes
a liability and corresponding expense for this future obligation.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002,
United's estimated outstanding number of awards was approximately 10.5
million, as compared with 11.1 million at the end of the prior year. United
estimates approximately 8.6 million of these awards will ultimately be
redeemed and, accordingly, the Company has recorded a liability of $253
million, which excludes the deferred revenue from the sale of miles by
ULS to program participants. The Company utilizes a number of estimates
in accounting for its Mileage Plus program that require management judgment.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Members may not reach
the threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not
always be redeemed for free travel. Therefore, the Company estimates how
many miles will never be used and excludes those miles from its estimate
of the liability. Based on historical data, the difference between the
awards expected to be redeemed and the total awards outstanding arises
because: (1) some awards will never be redeemed, (2) some will be redeemed
for non-travel benefits, and (3) some will be redeemed on partner carriers.
The Company also estimates the number of miles that will be used per award.
If actual miles used are more or less than estimated, the Company must
adjust its liability and corresponding expense.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When a travel award
level is attained, the Company records a liability for the estimated incremental
costs of providing travel, based on expected redemptions. United's incremental
costs include the additional costs of providing service to the award recipient,
such as fuel, meals, insurance and ticketing costs, for what would otherwise
be a vacant seat.&#160; The incremental costs do not include any contribution
to overhead or profit.&#160; A change to these cost estimates could have
a significant impact on the Company's liability in the year of change as
well as in future years.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In each of 2002, 2001 and
2000, 2.0 million Mileage Plus travel awards were used on United.&#160;
This number represents the number of awards for which travel was actually
provided in 2002 and not the number of seats that were allocated to award
travel.&#160; These awards represented 7.8% of United's total revenue passenger
miles in 2002, 8.1% in 2001, and 7.2% in 2000.&#160; Passenger preference
for Saver awards, which have inventory controls, keeps displacement of
revenue passengers at a minimum.&#160; Total miles redeemed for travel
on United in 2002, including awards and upgrades, represented 59% of the
total miles redeemed, of which 70% were used for travel within the U.S.
and Canada.&#160; In addition to the awards issued for travel on United,
approximately 24% of the total miles redeemed in 2002 were used for travel
on partner airlines.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As the Company also
sells mileage credits to participating airline partners, a change to either
the time period over which the credits are used or the estimate of the
number or fair value of tickets could have a significant impact on the
Company's revenues in the year of change as well as future years. Additional
information regarding the Mileage Plus frequent flyer program is included
in Note 2(g), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Mileage Plus
Awards" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Pension Benefits.</i></b>
The Company accounts for pension benefits using SFAS No. 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions" ("SFAS No. 87.") Under SFAS No. 87, pension expense
is recognized on an accrual basis over employees' approximate service periods
and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements.
Detailed information regarding the Company's pension plans are included
in Note 14, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements</u>. The Company's future funding requirements are
discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The calculation of
pension expense and pension obligations requires the use of a number of
assumptions, including the assumed discount rate and the expected return
on plan assets. The fair value of plan assets decreased from $7.6 billion
at December 31, 2001 to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2002. Lower investment
returns, higher benefit payments due to recent labor contract amendments
and declining discount rates have increased the difference between the
plans' fair value and accumulated benefit obligations from $1.3 billion
at December 31, 2001 to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2002.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company utilized
a discount rate of 6.75% at December 31, 2002, compared to 7.5% at December
31, 2001 and 7.75% at December 31, 2000. The discount rate is based on
the Moody's Aa bond index as of December 31, 2002, adjusted for the duration
of United's pension obligations. Duration is a commonly used measure of
interest rate risk that either assumes that yield changes do not change
the expected cash flows ("modified duration") or assumes that expected
cash flows may change given the fact that the yield changes ("effective
duration"). Since United's pension obligations are generally not satisfied
in a single lump sum distribution, management, with assistance from its
actuary, used the modified duration methodology to determine an acceptable
discount rate by matching the expected cash outflows of United's pension
obligations against available bonds with appropriate maturities.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company assumed an expected
rate of return on plan assets of 9.0% at December 31, 2002 compared to
9.75% used at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The expected return on plan assets
is based on an evaluation of the historical behavior of the broad financial
markets and the Company's investment portfolio and taking into consideration
input from the plans' investment consultant and actuary regarding expected
long-term market conditions and investment management performance. The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation
of assets to the following fund types: 60% equities, 35% fixed income and
5% other, with expected long-term rates of return of 11%, 6.5% and 13%,
respectively.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company believes
that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted
allocation and regularly reviews the actual asset allocation to periodically
rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate.
Pension expense is reduced by the expected return on plan assets, which
is measured by assuming the market-related value of plan assets increases
at the expected rate of return. The market-related value is a calculated
value that phases in differences between the expected rate of return and
the actual return over a period of five years.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Actuarial gains or
losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ
from the original assumptions. Under SFAS No. 87, those gains and losses
are not required to be recognized currently as pension expense, but instead
may be deferred. If the unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the
greater of the projected benefit obligations and the market-related value
of plan assets, the amount outside the 10% corridor is subject to amortization
over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses of
$4.5 billion. The recognition of these losses is expected to increase pension
expense by approximately $75 million, $108 million and $157 million in
2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, the Company had unrecognized
prior service costs from past benefit improvements of $1.2 billion, which
will be amortized as a component of pension expense over the average remaining
service life of the covered active employees. The recognition of these
costs is expected to increase pension expense by approximately $91 million
in each of 2003, 2004 and 2005.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Valuation Allowance
for Deferred Tax Assets.</i></b> The Company initially recorded a tax valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2002.
In recording the valuation allowance, management considered whether it
was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would
be realized. This analysis included consideration of scheduled reversals
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carryback
potential and tax planning strategies, in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." At December 31, 2002, the Company had recorded
a tax valuation allowance of $1.2 billion against its deferred tax assets.
See also Note 6, "Income Taxes" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements</u> for additional information.
</p><p><b>New Accounting Pronouncements -</b>
<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In June 2002, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting
for Costs Associated with Disposal or Exit Activities" ("SFAS No. 146").
SFAS No. 146 requires that liabilities for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities be recognized when the liabilities are incurred, rather
than when an entity commits to an exit plan. The Company adopted SFAS No.
146 on January 1, 2003. The new rules will change the timing of liability
and expense recognition related to exit or disposal activities, but not
the ultimate amount of such expenses.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In November 2002, the
FASB issued Interpretation 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others"
("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception
of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken
in issuing the guarantee. FIN 45 also expands the disclosures required
to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees
that it has issued. Initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN
45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified.
The disclosure requirements are effective immediately and are provided
in Note 15, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties" in
the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>. The Company does
not expect FIN 45 to have a material effect on its results of operations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In January 2003, the
FASB issued Interpretation 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
("FIN 46"). FIN 46 requires the consolidation of variable interest entities
("VIEs"), as defined. FIN 46 applies to VIEs created after January 31,
2003. The related disclosure requirements are effective immediately and
are provided in Note 15, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>. The Company is
still evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on its financial statements.
</p><p><b>Outlook for 2003</b>
<br/><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Information

</p><p><b>ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Interest Rate Risk -</b>
United's exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates
relates primarily to its debt obligations and short-term investments. United
does not use derivative financial instruments in its investments portfolio.
United's policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of
fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements, depending
upon market conditions. A portion of the borrowings are denominated in
foreign currencies which exposes the Company to risks associated with changes
in foreign exchange rates. To hedge against some of this risk, the Company
has placed foreign currency deposits (primarily for Japanese yen and euros)
to meet foreign currency lease obligations designated in the respective
currencies. Since unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on the foreign
currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency
obligations, the Company reduces its overall exposure to foreign currency
exchange rate volatility. The fair value of these deposits is determined
based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap
rate. The fair value of long-term debt is based on the quoted market prices
for the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows
using a U.S. Treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument,
adjusted by a credit spread.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Foreign Currency Risk
-</b> United has established a foreign currency hedging program using currency
forwards and options (purchasing put options and selling correlation options)
to hedge exposure to the Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar,
British pound, Australian dollar and the euro. The goal of the hedging
program is to effectively manage risk associated with fluctuations in the
value of the foreign currency, thereby making financial results more stable
and predictable. United does not use currency forwards or currency options
for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2002, United had no outstanding
currency hedges.

<p><b>ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</b>
</p><center>
<p><u>INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORTS</u></p></center>
<p>To the Board of Directors,
<br/>United Air Lines, Inc.
<br/>Elk Grove Township, Illinois
</p><p>We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial
position of United Air Lines, Inc., (a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL Corporation),
(Debtor-in-Possession) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholder's equity, and
cash flows for the year then ended. Our audit also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 for the year ended
December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial statements ("financial
statements") and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audit. The financial statements of the Company and financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 for the years ended December
31, 2001 and 2000, before the inclusion of disclosures as discussed in
Note 2(k), were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those
auditors, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
and financial statement schedule in their report dated February 20, 2002,
and included an explanatory paragraph that described a change in accounting
principle for the measurement of redeemable preferred ESOP stock and change
in accounting principles for revenue recognition.
</p><p>We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</p><p>In our opinion, such 2002 financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of United Air Lines, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in
our opinion, the 2002 financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic 2002 financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
</p><p>As discussed in Note 1, the Company has filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The accompanying financial
statements do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of
the bankruptcy proceedings. In particular, such financial statements do
not purport to show (a) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation
basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (b) as to prepetition
liabilities, the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies,
or the status and priority thereof; (c) as to stockholder accounts, the
effect of any changes that may be made in the capitalization of the Company;
or (d) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made in
its business.
</p><p>The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, as
a result of the bankruptcy filing, realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership,
are subject to uncertainty and raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plan concerning these
matters is also discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
</p><p>As discussed above, the Company's financial statements as and for the
years then ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, were audited by other auditors
who have ceased operations. As described in Note 2(k), these financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002.
Our audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note 2(k) with
respect to 2001 and 2000 included (<i>a</i>) agreeing the previously reported
net earnings (loss) to the previously issued financial statementsand the
adjustments to reported net earnings (loss) representing amortization expense
(including any related tax effects) recognized in those periods related
to intangible assets that are no longer being amortizedto the Company's
underlying records obtained from management, and (<i>b</i>) testing the
mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net earnings (loss)
to reported net earnings (loss). In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001
and 2000 in Note 2(k) are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to
audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements
of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly,
we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001
and 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.

<br/>&#160;
<br/>&#160;
</p><p>To the Board of Directors,
<br/>United Air Lines, Inc.:
</p><p>We have audited the accompanying statements of consolidated financial
position of United Air Lines, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiary
companies as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements
of consolidated operations, consolidated cash flows and consolidated stockholder's
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.
These financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.
</p><p>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</p><p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United
Air Lines, Inc. and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
</p><p>As explained in Note 1(b) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
effective January 1, 2001, the Company changed its accounting principles
for measurement of redeemable preferred ESOP stock as a result of the adoption
of Topic D-98 "Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities"
and effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed certain of its accounting
principles for revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."
</p><p>Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule referenced in Item
14(a) 2 herein is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be
set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole.

<p><b><u>(1)&#160; Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Chapter 11 Reorganization.
</i></b>On
December 9, 2002 ("Petition Date"), UAL Corporation, United Air Lines,
Inc. and 26 direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of
the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division ("Bankruptcy Court").
The reorganization cases are being jointly administered under the caption
"In re: UAL Corporation, et al., Case No. 02-48191" ("Chapter 11 Cases").
Included in the <u>Consolidated Financial Statements</u> are subsidiaries
which have not commenced Chapter 11 cases and are not Debtors. The assets
and liabilities of such non-filing subsidiaries are not considered material
to the <u>Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Debtors continue
to operate their businesses as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable
court orders. In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are authorized
under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may
not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without
the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. At hearings held on December
9, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Debtors first day motions for
various relief designed to stabilize operations and business relationships
with customers, vendors, employees and others and entered orders granting
authority to the Debtors to, among other things: (a) pay pre-petition and
post-petition employee wages, salaries, benefits and other employee obligations;
(b) honor customer service programs, including United's Mileage Plus frequent
flyer program and ticketing program; and (c) honor obligations arising
prior to the Petition Date related to the Company's interline, clearinghouse,
code sharing and other similar agreements. The Bankruptcy Court also gave
interim approval for the Debtors to access a total of up to $1.5 billion
of debtor-in-possession secured financing ("DIP Financing") provided by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank One, NA and The CIT Group/Business
Credit, Inc. Final approval of the DIP Financing was granted by the Bankruptcy
Court on December 30, 2002. (See "DIP Financing" below.)
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under Section 362 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the bankruptcy petition automatically
stays most actions against a debtor, including most actions to collect
pre-petition indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the
debtor's estate. Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially
all pre-petition liabilities are subject to settlement under a plan of
reorganization to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Shortly after the Chapter
11 filing, the Debtors began notifying all known current or potential creditors
of the Chapter 11 filing for the purpose of identifying and quantifying
all pre-petition claims against the Debtors. The Chapter 11 filing triggered
defaults on substantially all debt and lease obligations of the Debtors.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Notwithstanding the preceding
general discussion of the automatic stay, the Debtors' rights to possess
and operate certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related
equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional
sale contract are governed by a particular provision of the Bankruptcy
Code that specifies different treatment. Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code ("Section 1110") provides that unless the Debtors take certain action,
within 60 days after the Petition Date or such later date as is agreed
by the applicable lessor, secured party, or conditional vendor, the contractual
rights of such financier to take possession of such equipment and to enforce
any of its other rights or remedies under the applicable agreement are
not limited or otherwise affected by the automatic stay or any other provision
of the Bankruptcy Code.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the automatic stay lasts for only 60 days with respect
to Section 1110-eligible aircraft, engines and related equipment except
under two conditions. The debtor may extend the 60-day period by agreement
of the relevant financier, with court approval. Alternatively, the debtor
may agree to perform all of the obligations under the applicable financing
and cure any defaults thereunder as required by the Bankruptcy Code. In
the absence of either such arrangement, the financier may take possession
of the property and enforce any of its contractual rights or remedies to
sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such equipment.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The 60-day period under Section
1110 in the Company's Chapter 11 Case expired on February 7, 2003. The
Company has reached agreements with a significant number of aircraft financiers
to extend the automatic stay, in exchange in certain instances for United's
agreement to make specified payments. United also has made elections with
respect to certain other aircraft to cure all existing defaults and to
pay the contract rates as required by the Bankruptcy Code. With respect
to certain aircraft, however, United neither negotiated an extension of
the automatic stay nor agreed to cure and resume payments. Accordingly,
the financiers of such aircraft may seek to repossess the property. Although
no such financiers have sought to repossess any United equipment, and although
the Company believes that market conditions for commercial aircraft make
repossession unlikely, there can be no assurance that United's lendors
and lessors will not repossess any of the applicable aircraft. Any such
repossessions could result in substantial disruptions to United's operations
and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject
certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including, without limitation,
leases of real property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the
approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. In general,
rejection of an unexpired lease or executory contract is treated as a pre-petition
breach of the lease or contract in question and, subject to certain exceptions,
relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such
lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a
pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed
breach. Counterparties to such rejected contracts or leases may file claims
against the Debtors' estate for such damages. Generally, the assumption
of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires the Debtors to cure
most existing defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease.
In this regard, the Company expects that liabilities subject to compromise
and resolution in the Chapter 11 Cases will arise in the future as a result
of damage claims created by the Debtors' rejection of various executory
contracts and unexpired leases. Conversely, the Company would expect that
the assumption of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases may
convert liabilities shown as subject to compromise to liabilities not subject
to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Section 1113(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to move to reject its collective bargaining
agreements ("CBAs") if the debtor first satisfies several statutorily prescribed
substantive and procedural prerequisites and obtains the Bankruptcy Court's
approval of the rejection. After bargaining in good faith and sharing relevant
information with its unions, the debtor must make proposals to modify its
existing CBAs based on the most complete and reliable information available
at the time. The proposed modifications must be necessary to permit the
reorganization of the debtor and must ensure that all the affected parties
are treated fairly and equitably relative to the creditors and the debtor.
Ultimately, rejection is appropriate if the unions refuse to agree to the
debtors necessary proposals "without good cause" and the balance of the
equities favors rejection.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As required by the
Bankruptcy Code, the United States Trustee for the Northern District of
Illinois ("U.S. Trustee") has appointed an official committee of unsecured
creditors (the "Creditors' Committee"). The Creditors Committee and its
legal representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that come
before the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Debtors. There can be no
assurance that the Creditors' Committee will support the Debtors' positions
or the Debtors' ultimate plan of reorganization, once proposed, and disagreements
between the Debtors and the Creditors' Committee could protract the Chapter
11 Cases, could negatively impact the Debtors' ability to operate during
the Chapter 11 Cases and could delay the Debtors' emergence from Chapter
11.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In order to successfully
exit Chapter 11, the Company will need to propose, and obtain confirmation
by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would resolve,
among other things, the debtors' pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for
its corporate governance subsequent to exit from court supervision under
Chapter 11. On March 21, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the extension
of the Company's "exclusivity period" (during which it is the only party
permitted to file a plan of reorganization) to October 2003, but under
certain circumstances, the exclusivity period could be shortened by two
months. The timing of filing a plan of reorganization by the Company will
depend on the timing and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in the
Chapter 11 Cases. Although the Company expects to file a plan of reorganization
that provides for its emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern, there
can be no assurance at this time that a plan of reorganization will be
proposed by the Debtors or confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, or that any
such plan will be implemented successfully.
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Financial Statement
Presentation</b>. </i>The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants' Statement of Position 90-7 ("SOP 90-7"), "Financial Reporting
by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code," and on a going-concern
basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; SOP 90-7 requires that the
financial statements for periods subsequent to the Chapter 11 filing petition
distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the
reorganization from the operations of the business. Accordingly, revenues,
expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses, and
provisions for losses directly associated with the reorganization and restructuring
of the business are reported separately in the financial statements. The
<u>Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position </u>distinguish pre-petition liabilities
subject to compromise from both those pre-petition liabilities that are
not subject to compromise and from post-petition liabilities. Liabilities
subject to compromise are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed,
even if they may be settled for lesser amounts.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition, as a result
of the Chapter 11 filing, the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership,
are subject to uncertainty. Given this uncertainty, there is substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. While
operating as debtors-in-possession under the protection of Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code and subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court or
otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business, the Debtors,
or some of them, may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate
or settle liabilities for some amounts other than those reflected in the
consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could
materially change the amounts and classifications in the historical consolidated
financial statements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pursuant to the Bankruptcy
Code, the Debtors have filed schedules with the Bankruptcy Court setting
forth the assets and liabilities of the Debtors as of the Petition Date.
Differences between amounts recorded by the Debtors and claims filed by
creditors will be investigated and resolved as part of the Chapter 11 Cases.
The deadline for filing proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court is May
12, 2003, with a limited exception for governmental entities, which have
until June 9, 2003 to file proofs of claim. Accordingly, the ultimate number
and allowed amounts of such claims are not presently known.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; DIP Financing.
</i></b>The
DIP Financing consists of two facilities, a $300 million facility provided
by Bank One N.A. ("Bank One Facility") and a $1.2 billion facility provided
by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank One, N.A. and The CIT
Group/Business Credit, Inc. ("Club Facility"). The Company has received
commitments of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility following the completion
of the syndication process for that facility; the balance is conditioned
upon the participation of one or more additional lenders approved by the
existing participants.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Bank One Facility
consists of a $300 million term loan with an interest rate option of the
prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%). As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $300 million at the LIBOR
option which is due in five equal monthly installments beginning in March
2004.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Club Facility consists
of a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of $800 million and
a term loan of $400 million, which matures on July 1, 2004. The Company
has the option of borrowing under the Club Facility at an interest rate
of the prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%).
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $400 million under the
term loan at the LIBOR option. In addition, the Company had available a
$100 million letter of credit facility which was not drawn down on in December,
but was fully utilized by March 2003. The remaining $700 million under
the revolving credit facility is subject to stringent availability hurdles
as discussed below.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The DIP Financing is
guaranteed by each of the Debtors and is secured by first priority liens
on all unencumbered present and future assets of the Debtors and by junior
liens on all other assets of the Debtors, other than certain specified
assets, including assets which are subject to financing agreements that
are entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 to the extent such financing
agreements prohibit such junior liens. In addition, the Bank One Facility
is secured by cash collateral collected under the Co-Branded Credit Card
Agreement between Bank One and the Company.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The terms of the DIP
Financing include covenants that require the Company to satisfy ongoing
monthly financial requirements as determined by EBITDAR (earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rents)
and covenants that limit, among other things, the Debtors' ability to borrow
additional money, make capital expenditures and make additional corporate
investments. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a minimum
unrestricted cash balance, excluding escrowed amounts, of $300 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the Club Facility,
borrowing availability is determined by a formula based on a percentage
of eligible assets. The eligible assets consist of certain previously unencumbered
aircraft, spare engines, spare parts inventory, certain flight simulators
and quick engine change kits. The underlying value of such assets may fluctuate
periodically due to prevailing market conditions and fluctuations in value
may have an impact on the borrowing availability under the Club Facility.
Availability may be further limited by additional reserves imposed by the
banks in their commercially reasonable discretion.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The remaining $700
million of availability under the Club Facility, subject to the limitation
on borrowing availability discussed above, will be available to the Company
after certain conditions are met, including achieving positive cumulative
EBITDAR; submitting a certified updated business plan; providing updated
appraisals on the collateral and ascertaining there has been no material
adverse change with respect to transferability of routes, gate leaseholds
or slots.
</p><p><b><u>(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(a) Basis of Presentation</i>
-</b> United is a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL. The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of United and all of its majority-owned
affiliates (collectively "the Company"). All significant intercompany transactions
are eliminated. Certain prior-year financial statement items have been
reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(b) Use of Estimates</i>
-</b> The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (c) Airline Revenues</i></b>
- Passenger fares and cargo revenues are recorded as operating revenues
when the transportation is furnished. The value of unused passenger tickets
is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. In addition,
United has formed bilateral alliances with other airlines which include:
joint frequent flyer participation; code sharing of flight operations;
coordination of reservations, baggage handling and flight schedules; and
other resource-sharing activities. Code sharing is an agreement under which
a carrier's flights can be marketed under the two-letter airline designator
code of another carrier. Revenues earned under these arrangements are allocated
between the code share partners based on existing contractual agreements
and airline industry standard pro-ration formulas and are recognized as
passenger revenue when the transportation is provided.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents
and Short-Term Investments</i> -</b> Cash in excess of operating requirements
is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing investments.
Investments with a maturity of three months or less on their acquisition
date are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Other investments are
classified as short-term investments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; From time to time, United
lends certain of its securities classified as cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments to third parties. United requires collateral
in an amount exceeding the value of the securities and is obligated to
reacquire the securities at the end of the contract. United accounts for
these transactions as secured borrowings rather than sales and does not
remove the securities from the balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, United
had no secured borrowings outstanding.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002 and
2001, $325 million and $476 million, respectively, of investments in debt
securities included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
were classified as available-for-sale, and $576 million and $1.8 billion,
respectively, were classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt
securities classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair value based
on the quoted market prices for the securities, which does not differ significantly
from their cost basis. Investments classified as held-to-maturity are stated
at cost which approximates market due to their short-term maturities. The
gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale securities are included
in interest income for each respective year.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002, the
Company had $556 million in restricted cash, including $116 million in
long-term restricted cash. The cash largely represents security for worker
compensation obligations in states where United self-insures, security
deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions which process
the Company's sales.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(e) Aircraft Fuel,
Spare Parts and Supplies</i> -</b> Aircraft fuel and maintenance and operating
supplies are stated at average cost. Flight equipment spare parts are stated
at average cost less an obsolescence allowance.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(f) Operating Property
and Equipment</i> -</b> Owned operating property and equipment is stated
at cost. Property under capital leases, and the related obligation for
future lease payments, are initially recorded at an amount equal to the
then present value of those lease payments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Depreciation and amortization
of owned depreciable assets is based on the straight-line method over their
estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
remaining period of the lease or the estimated service life of the related
asset, whichever is less. Aircraft are depreciated to estimated salvage
values, generally over lives of 25 to 30 years; buildings are depreciated
over lives of 25 to 45 years; and other property and equipment are depreciated
over lives of 3 to 15 years.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Properties under capital
leases are amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease
or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated service lives.
Lease terms are 10 to 22 years for aircraft and flight simulators and 29
years for buildings. Amortization of capital leases is included in depreciation
and amortization expense.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of minor replacements, are charged to maintenance expense
accounts as incurred. Costs of additions to and renewals of units of property
are charged to property and equipment accounts.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(g) Mileage Plus Awards</i>
-</b> United accrues the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel
awards earned under its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program when such award
levels are reached. United sells mileage credits to participating airline
partners in the Mileage Plus program and UAL Loyalty Services ("ULS"),
a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL, sells mileage credits to non-airline
business partners.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 2001 and 2000, a portion
of revenue from the sale of mileage credits was deferred and recognized
as passenger revenue when the transportation was provided. Accordingly,
United recorded a charge of $209 million, net of tax, in 2000, for the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the application
of the accounting method to prior years. This change resulted in a reduction
to revenues of approximately $38 million for 2000.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (h) Deferred Gains</i>
-</b> Gains on aircraft sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and
amortized over the lives of the leases as a reduction of rental expense.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(i) United Express</i></b>
- United has marketing agreements under which independent regional carriers,
flying under the United Express name, feed passengers to United owned and
operated flights. United pays these carriers on a fee-per-departure basis
and includes the revenues derived from the carriers in passenger revenue,
net of these expenses. United Express revenues (net of expenses) included
in passenger revenues were $(255) million, $(232) million and $(49) million
for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; While the effect on
United's results, taking into account only the United Express flights,
is negative, the Company realizes a significant benefit (not included in
the results shown above) from the traffic provided to United's operations
as a result of these agreements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United has call options
on 83 regional jets owned or leased by these carriers. The call option
is a standard part of the United Express agreement and is intended to allow
United to secure control over regional jets used for United Express flying
in the event a United Express agreement is terminated. The call option
reduces this risk if the Company determines that a change of United Express
carrier is necessary, particularly due to the significant time lag between
order and delivery of aircraft (such as regional jets made to United's
specifications).
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The call options are
only exercisable if United maintains a specified credit rating and the
United Express carrier fails to meet required operating and/or financial
performance levels for a specified period of time. Due to United's current
credit rating, none of the call options are exercisable at this time.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (j) Advertising</i></b>
- Advertising costs, which are included in other operating expenses, are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $147 million, $208 million
and $267 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (k) Intangibles</i></b>
- Intangibles consist primarily of route acquisition costs and intangible
pension assets (see Note 14, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans").
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Effective January 1, 2002,
United adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS
No. 142"). In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, United discontinued
$12 million in annual amortization expense on route acquisition costs,
which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 also requires
companies to test intangibles for impairment on an annual basis or on an
interim basis when a triggering event occurs. During the first quarter
of 2002, the Company performed an initial evaluation of its intangibles
and determined that the fair value of its intangibles was in excess of
the book value.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The following information
relates to United's intangibles at December 31, 2002:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Slots and gates are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related leases.
Other intangibles are amortized over periods of 3 to 10 years. Total amortization
expense recognized in 2002 was $7 million. The Company expects to record
amortization expense of $4 million in each of the next five years.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Route authorities are
rights granted by governments to operate flights to and from a particular
country. These authorities are very specific and limited, fixed in nature
and are rarely available in the marketplace. Accordingly, route authorities
are highly valued and sought after assets by all airlines. During 2002,
United obtained a third-party appraisal of its route authorities which
concluded that the market value of these assets continues to be considerably
in excess of the book value.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Slots and gates, like
routes, are highly valued assets that do not frequently come into the marketplace.
The Company has no intention to sell these assets and believes that the
market value is in excess of the recorded book value.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pro forma results for
the years ended 2001 and 2000 assuming the discontinuation of amortization
are shown below:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(l) Measurement of
Impairments</i></b> - Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"
("SFAS No. 144"), which addresses the accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 did not have
an effect on the Company's results of operations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United's policy is
to recognize an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds
its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount
of the charge is the difference between the asset's carrying value and
fair market value.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>(m) Stock Option Accounting</i></b>
- At December 31, 2002, the Company had certain stock-based employee compensation
plans, as described in<b> </b>Note 12, "Related Party Transactions."The
Company has elected to continue accounting for those plans under the recognition
and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations.
No stock-based employee compensation cost pertaining to stock options is
reflected in the Company's net earnings (loss), as all options granted
under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. If compensation cost for
stock-based employee compensation plans had been determined using the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," the Company's net earnings (loss) would have instead been
reported as the pro forma amounts indicated below:

</p><p><b><i>2002 -</i></b>
<br/><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Severance.</i></b>
During the fourth quarter of 2002, United announced the closing of three
reservation centers, a maintenance line and four international stations
and the conversion of five stations in the U.S. to United Express service,
which resulted in the furloughing of a number of employees. Additionally,
in connection with the Company's plan to decrease the airline's flying
schedule, as well as overall cost-saving measures, the Company announced
a reduction in employment levels effective January and February 2003. As
a result of the announced furloughs, the Company recorded a special charge
of $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for severance-related charges.
</p><p><b><i>2001 -</i></b>
<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Related to September
11.</i> </b>During the third quarter of 2001, United recorded a special
charge of $1.3 billion in operating expense and $49 million in non-operating
expense for amounts relating to the September 11 terrorist attacks and
the resulting impact on the Company's schedule and operations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The special charge

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; After the September
11 terrorist attacks, the Company grounded the B727-200 and B737-200 fleets
and recorded a charge of $271 million, reflecting the write down of the
fleets to fair value.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Due to the changes
implemented to United's operations, the Company reviewed its fleet for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, as amended by SFAS No. 144.
Management determined that the estimated net undiscounted future cash flows
generated by its B737-500 and B747-400 fleets would be less than their
carrying value. Management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows
with models used by the Company in making fleet and scheduling decisions.
These models utilized the Company's projections of passenger yield, fuel
costs, labor costs and other relevant factors for the markets where these
aircraft will operate. The aircraft in each of these fleets were written
down to their fair market values, as estimated by management using published
sources, third-party appraisals and bids received from third parties. Accordingly,
the special charge includes an impairment charge of $517 million for these
aircraft fleets resulting from the anticipated decrease in future cash
flows.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Also as a result
of the terrorist attacks, the Company furloughed approximately 20,000 employees
across all work groups (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, ramp service,
customer service and management and salaried employees). In connection
with the furloughs, United accrued severance costs of approximately $217
million, including a one-time curtailment charge relating to the accelerated
recognition of unrecognized prior service costs for certain of the Company's
pension plans.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Also included in the
special charge is $107 million relating to the write-off of capital projects
no longer being pursued. As a direct result of September 11, management
made the decision to terminate all funding and labor resources for numerous
capitalized projects that were in-process prior to September 11 and which
did not provide any immediate economic or long-term safety benefits to
customers or the airline. The projects and related amounts capitalized
that were discontinued following September 11 included computer system
development costs ($48 million), aircraft improvements ($33 million), airport
facility improvements ($21 million) and other miscellaneous projects ($5
million).
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; After management announced
the furlough and the freeze on all capital expenditures, United determined
that the Company was unlikely to meet certain commitments or provisions
of certain executory contracts with third parties. The executory contracts
are related to agreements with state and local governments ($157 million),
aircraft improvements ($11 million) and facilities and other ($13 million)
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Additionally,
the Company recorded a non-operating special charge of $49 million related
to certain non-operating aircraft that were leased to others. The fair
value of these aircraft was significantly impacted by the events of September
11.

Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the "Act")
enacted in response to the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government
made $5.0 billion in federal grants available to the airline industry.
The Company received a total of $782 million in grants under the Act, of
which $652 million was received in 2001 and $130 million in 2002. These
amounts represent the Company's total allocation of grant money under the
Act.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2002, the Company
reversed $44 million of overaccruals pertaining to the reduction in force
as a result of the Company furloughing fewer employees than was initially
anticipated in early 2002.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Through December 31,
2002, the Company had received approximately $58 million related to insurance
recoveries on aircraft destroyed by the September 11 attacks and approximately
$12 million related to other covered expenses.&#160; The Company anticipates
that its liability from claims arising from the events of September 11,
2001 will be significant, after considering the liability protections provided
for by the Act; however, the Company expects that any amounts paid on such
claims will be borne by its insurance carriers as claims are resolved and,
in any event, the Company believes that, under the Act, its liability will
be limited to its insurance coverage.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company has not
incurred any material environmental obligations relating to September 11.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the first quarter
of 2000, the Company announced the planned early retirement of the B727-222
aircraft fleet resulting in an impairment charge of $11 million, in accordance
with SFAS No. 121, as amended by SFAS No. 144.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company also announced
its decision to end its freighter operation effective December 24, 2000,
resulting in the early retirement of four DC10-30 freighter aircraft which
were under lease. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $12 million
in the fourth quarter of 2000. Additionally, the Company permanently grounded
seven leased B747-238 aircraft in the second quarter of 2000 and recorded
a $24 million charge, as the aircraft continued to be leased but were no
longer used for operating purposes beyond 2000.&#160; These charges were
recognized in accordance with EITF 88-10, "Costs Associated with Lease
Modification or Termination," as it was determined that the grounded, leased
aircraft and improvements had no substantive future use or benefit. Accordingly,
the remaining rental payments and capitalized leasehold improvements were
written-off.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Finally, the Company
recorded a charge of $37 million in the second quarter of 2000 when the
Company retired the inflight video system on certain B777-222 aircraft,
which was replaced by an enhanced and more reliable inflight video system.
The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $17 million to reduce
the carrying value of certain equipment no longer used in the Company's
operations as of the fourth quarter 2000, to net realizable value in accordance
with SFAS No. 121.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Priceline. </i></b>In
1999, United received 5.5 million warrants convertible into 5.5 million
shares of Priceline common stock at an exercise price of $52.625, which
were recorded at their fair value of $61 million. In the third quarter
of 2000, United recorded an impairment loss of $38 million, net of tax,
in non-operating expense, for the write-down of these warrants to zero.
Subsequent to the third quarter of 2000, the Company sold all of its warrants
in Priceline for less than $1 million in proceeds.

<p><b><u>(5) Other Income (Expense) - Miscellaneous</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Included in Other income
(expense) - "Miscellaneous, net" was $(13) million, $(21) million and $(22)
million of foreign exchange gains (losses) in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
</p><p><b><u>(6) Income Taxes</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United, its subsidiaries
and other affiliated companies file a consolidated federal income tax return
with UAL. Under an intercompany tax allocation policy, United and its subsidiaries
compute, record and pay UAL for their own tax liability as if they were
separate companies filing separate returns. In determining their own tax
liabilities, United and each of its subsidiaries take into account all
tax credits or benefits generated and utilized as separate companies, and
they are compensated for the aforementioned tax benefits only if they would
be able to use those benefits on separate company bases.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 2002, United and its subsidiaries
incurred both a regular and an alternative minimum tax ("AMT") loss. The
carryback of the AMT loss to 1998 and 1999 will produce a federal tax refund,
thereby reducing AMT credits. The primary differences between United's
regular tax loss and AMT loss are the depreciation adjustments and preferences.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In assessing the realizability
of its deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely
than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized.
During 2002, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred
tax assets.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The provision (credit) for
income taxes is summarized as follows:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002, United
and its subsidiaries had $294 million of federal AMT credits and $1.6 billion
of federal and state net operating loss ("NOL") credits which may be carried
forward to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. Federal NOL credits
of $218 million expire in 2022 and $1.2 billion expire in 2023.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company has determined,
based on its history of operating earnings (losses) and current declaration
of bankruptcy, that it is more likely than not that the gross deferred
tax assets, net of valuation allowances at December 31, 2002 are expected
to be realized through the reversals of existing deferred tax credits.
</p><p><b><u>(7) Investments</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2000, United
owned 15,940,000 shares (18%) in Galileo, a leading provider of electronic
global distribution services for the travel industry. On October 1, 2001,
Cendant Corporation ("Cendant") acquired all of the outstanding common
stock of Galileo for a combination of stock and cash. Accordingly, United
tendered all of its shares in Galileo for net proceeds of $65 million and
21,168,320 shares in Cendant, resulting in a gain of $244 million. In the
fourth quarter of 2001, United sold 14 million shares of Cendant common
stock for net proceeds of $194 million, resulting in a gain of $17 million.
In January 2002, United sold its remaining investment in Cendant for net
proceeds of $137 million, resulting in a gain of $46 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 1998 and 1999, United
invested approximately $51 million in GetThere.com resulting in a 28% minority
interest consisting of common stock, warrants and options. United accounted
for its investment in GetThere.com using the equity method of accounting.
On October 6, 2000, Sabre Holdings Corporation acquired all of the outstanding
common stock of GetThere.com for $17.75 per share. Accordingly, after converting
its options and warrants, United tendered all of its shares for net proceeds
of $147 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $69 million, net
of tax.
</p><p><b><u>(8) Liabilities Subject to Compromise</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Liabilities subject
to compromise refers to liabilities incurred prior to the commencement
of the Chapter 11 Cases. These amounts represent the Company's estimate
of known or potential pre-petition claims to be resolved in connection
with the Chapter 11 Cases. Such claims remain subject to future adjustments.
Adjustments may result from negotiations, actions of the Bankruptcy Court,
rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases, the determination
as to the value of any collateral securing claims, proofs of claim or other
events. It is anticipated that such adjustments may be material. Payment
terms for these amounts will be established in connection with the Chapter
11 Cases.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002,
the Company had liabilities subject to compromise of approximately $14.0
billion which consisted of the following:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002, United
had outstanding a total of $3.9 billion of debt at variable rates from
2.03% to 9.52% based on specified spreads over LIBOR.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In December 2002, the
Company borrowed $700 million under the DIP Facility as described more
fully in Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code."
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During 2002, the Company
refinanced approximately $525 million in interim financing through a $775
million private debt financing which refinanced certain aircraft. The Company
also arranged long-term financing for approximately $314 million in debt
that had been placed in interim financing facilities and refinanced $238
million in long-term debt through a sale-leaseback transaction.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In July 2000, the Company
issued $921 million in enhanced equipment trust certificates ("EETCs")
to refinance certain owned aircraft and aircraft under operating leases.
Net proceeds after refinancing the operating leases was $622 million. In
December 2000, the Company issued an additional $1.5 billion in EETCs to
finance certain owned aircraft and in August 2001, the Company issued $1.5
billion in EETCs to finance certain owned aircraft. Also during 2001, the
Company issued $1.0 billion in long-term debt to finance the acquisition
of aircraft.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition to scheduled
principal payments, in 2000 the Company repaid $116 million in principal
amount of debentures prior to maturity. The debentures were scheduled to
mature at various times through 2021. An extraordinary loss of $6 million,
net of tax benefits of $4 million, was recorded, reflecting amounts paid
in excess of the debt carrying value.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002, United
had recorded $493 million in special facilities revenue bonds to finance
the acquisition and construction of certain facilities at Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Miami and Chicago. United guarantees the payment of these
bonds under various payment and loan agreements. The bond proceeds are
restricted to expenditures on the facilities and unspent amounts are classified
as other assets in the <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial Position</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Various assets, principally
aircraft, having an aggregate book value of $11.0 billion at December 31,
2002, were pledged as security under various loan agreements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The carrying amount
of the Company's borrowings under the DIP Facility approximates the fair
value. The fair value of the Company's debt included in liabilities subject
to compromise cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2002. The
fair value of debt at December 31, 2001 was $6.9 billion.
</p><p><b><u>(11) Lease Obligations</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company leases aircraft,
airport passenger terminal space, aircraft hangars and related maintenance
facilities, cargo terminals, other airport facilities, real estate, office
and computer equipment and vehicles. As allowed under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Company may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain
executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property,
aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and certain other conditions. Consequently, the Company anticipates
that its liabilities pertaining to leases, and the amounts related thereto
as discussed below, will change significantly in the future.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At December 31, 2002, scheduled
future minimum lease payments under capital leases (substantially all of
which are for aircraft) and operating leases having initial or remaining
noncancelable lease terms of more than one year were as follows:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of December 31, 2002,
United leased 300 aircraft, 59 of which were under capital leases. These
leases have terms of 5 to 26 years, and expiration dates ranging from 2003
through 2018. Under the terms of all leases, United has the right to purchase
the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some cases at fair market
value and in others at fair market value or a percentage of cost. The theoretical
present value of United's future minimum lease payments under operating
leases for aircraft and non-aircraft was $5.2 billion and $3.5 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2002.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Certain of the Company's
aircraft lease transactions contain provisions such as put options giving
the lessor the right to require the Company to purchase the aircraft at
lease termination for a certain amount resulting in residual value guarantees.
Leases containing this or similar provisions are recorded as capital leases
on the statement of financial position and, accordingly, any and all residual
value guarantee amounts contained in an aircraft lease are fully reflected
as capital lease obligations on the<u> Statements of Consolidated Financial
Position</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In connection with the financing
of certain aircraft accounted for as capital leases, United had on deposit
at December 31, 2002 an aggregate 42 billion yen ($357 million), 387 million
euro ($405 million) and $14 million in certain banks and had pledged an
irrevocable security interest in such deposits to certain of the aircraft
lessors. These deposits will be used to pay off an equivalent amount of
recorded capital lease obligations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Amounts charged to rent expense,
net of minor amounts of sublease rentals, were $1.5 billion in each of
2002, 2001 and 2000. Included in 2002 rental expense was $11<b> </b>million
in contingent rentals, resulting from changes in interest rates for operating
leases under which the rent payments are based on variable interest rates.
</p><p><b><u>(12) Related Party Transactions</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL
Loyalty Services ("ULS"), a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL, had been United's
agent to market and sell Mileage Plus miles to non-airline business partners.
In the first quarter of 2002, UAL made changes to its corporate structure
which resulted in substantially all of UAL's customer loyalty and marketing
programs (which were previously the responsibility of United) becoming
owned and operated by ULS. These changes were designed to increase the
overall value of UAL's loyalty businesses by focusing management attention
on these activities and enhancing the range of products and services offered
to Mileage Plus members and business partners.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; First,
Mileage Plus, Inc. ("MPI") dividended certain assets related to the Mileage
Plus business to its parent company, Mileage Plus Holdings, Inc. ("MPH"),
which was then a wholly owned subsidiary of United. Immediately thereafter,
MPH dividended to United all of the stock of MPI. United then sold all
of the stock of MPH to ULS in consideration for a $900 million unsecured
promissory note (payable over 12 years and bearing interest at a rate of
7% per annum), plus the assumption of the outstanding liability for miles
previously sold to non-airline third parties (approximately $500 million).
The purchase price was based on the estimated fair value of MPH, as determined
by the present value of the net future cash flows of the entity.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Simultaneously
with the above transactions, United also dividended certain assets associated
with direct-to-consumer marketing and service businesses. These included
certain united.com related assets, certain United Vacations and Mileage
Plus related assets, and the assets relating to Silver Wings, Cruise4Miles
and Sky Mall services. UAL then made a capital contribution of these same
assets to ULS.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Mileage
Plus participation agreements with other airlines and the customer service
call centers supporting Mileage Plus members were not included in these
transactions. These assets will remain part of MPI and therefore, of United.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Due
to the related party nature of these transactions, no gain or loss was
recorded at United, UAL or ULS. Any differences between the purchase price
and the book value of the assets was adjusted through equity. As a result
of these transactions, United's equity increased approximately $1.4 billion.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Also
as a result of these transactions, ULS became responsible for the sale
of non-airline miles and retains the gross proceeds (and associated liability)
for the sale of those miles. United, through MPI, retains the right to
sell and the associated liability of the miles awarded for travel on United
or any of its airline partners. As Mileage Plus members use miles earned
through means other than air travel to redeem a travel award on United,
ULS will be obligated to compensate United for the value of this award
travel. Likewise, United will be obligated to pay ULS for miles earned
through air travel as they are redeemed for any non-air travel award. The
price of a mile sold between the two entities as a result of these arrangements
is expected to be contractually mandated and fixed. The initial allocation
of the total mileage liability and the percentage of miles deemed to be
earned through other than air travel are also expected to be contractually
fixed and will be based on specified market factors. Terms of these contracts
may change based upon market conditions.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It
is the intention of both United and ULS that these transactions and the
allocation of miles be transparent to Mileage Plus members and partners.
While United's passenger and other revenue has been significantly impacted
from these transactions, the interest and principal repayments on the promissory
note, as well as the anticipated growth in the number and value of United's
customers and business partners as a result of these relationships, are
intended to compensate United for this reduction in revenue.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 2002, United recognized
$326 million in revenues and $60 million in interest income from ULS and
$51 million in commission expense and purchased services paid to ULS.&#160;
During 2001, United paid ULS approximately $175 million, respectively,
in commissions related to bookings on united.com and the sale of miles
to third parties.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Air Wis Services, Inc.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL, owns Air Wisconsin, Inc. At December
31, 2002 and 2001, United had outstanding loans to Air Wisconsin, Inc.
in the amount of $149 million and $162 million, respectively. As a result
of the bankruptcy filing, these loans are classified as liabilities subject
to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As of result of the
bankruptcy filing, all intercompany accounts receivable have been reclassified
to United's equity and all intercompany accounts payable have been reclassified
to liabilities subject to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Certain officers and key
employees of United participate in UAL stock award plans. The Company has
also awarded shares of restricted stock to officers and key employees.
These shares generally vest over a five-year period and are subject to
transfer restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior
to vesting. Unearned compensation, representing the fair market value of
the stock at the measurement date for the award, is amortized to salaries
and related costs over the vesting period. The amortization of restricted
stock resulted in $1 million in compensation expense being recorded in
2002 and $2 million in each of the years 2001 and 2000.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; SFAS No. 123 establishes
a fair value based method of accounting for stock options. As discussed
in Note 2(m), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Stock Option
Accounting," the Company has elected to continue using the intrinsic value
method of accounting prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as permitted by SFAS
No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition
and Disclosure."
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The weighted-average grant
date fair value of restricted shares issued was $3.03 for shares issued
in 2002 and $51.83 for shares issued in 2000. No restricted shares were
issued in 2001. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's
stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion,
the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure
of the fair value of its stock options.
</p><p><b><u>(13) Employee Stock Ownership Plan</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On July 12, 1994, the stockholders
of UAL approved a plan of recapitalization to provide an approximately
55% equity interest in UAL to certain employees of United in exchange for
wage concessions and work-rule changes. The employees' equity interest
was allocated to individual employees through the year 2000 under ESOPs
which were created as a part of the recapitalization.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The ESOPs cover employees
represented by ALPA, the IAM and U.S. management and salaried employees
and include a "Leveraged ESOP," a "Non-Leveraged ESOP" and a "Supplemental
ESOP." Both the Leveraged ESOP and the Non-Leveraged ESOP are tax-qualified
plans while the Supplemental ESOP is not a tax-qualified plan.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The equity interests were
delivered to employees through two classes of preferred stock (Class 1
and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, collectively "ESOP Preferred Stock"),
and the voting interests were delivered through three separate classes
of preferred stocks (Class P, M and S Voting Preferred Stock, collectively,
"Voting Preferred Stock"). The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock was delivered
to an ESOP trust in seven separate sales under the Leveraged ESOP, the
last of which occurred on January 5, 2000. Based on Internal Revenue Code
Limitations, shares of the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock were either contributed
to the Non-Leveraged ESOP or allocated as "book entry" shares to the Supplemental
ESOP annually through the year 2000.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock were legally released or allocated to employee accounts as of year-end.
The final allocation of shares occurred in March 2001 effective December
31, 2000. During 2002, 88,981 shares of Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock previously
allocated in book entry form were issued and either contributed to the
qualified plan or converted and sold on behalf of terminating employees.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For the Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock committed to be contributed to employees under the Supplemental ESOP,
employees can elect to receive their "book entry" shares in cash upon termination
of employment. At December 31, 2002, there were 360,831 book entry shares
outstanding under the Supplemental ESOP. The estimated fair value of such
shares at December 31, 2002 and 2001 is reflected in the <u>Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position</u>.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In September 2002,
State Street Bank and Trust ("State Street") was appointed as an independent
fiduciary for the ESOP. On September 27, 2002, State Street filed a Form
144 "Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities" ("Form 144") with the SEC to
indicate it may sell up to 10,964,700 shares of UAL common stock over the
next three months. On October 25, 2002, November 22, 2002 and December
9, 2002, State Street amended its Form 144 to sell an additional 4,040,758,
10,283,398 and 28,291,896, respectively. The shares of common stock are
issuable upon the conversion of shares of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock held by the plan and are issued on a private placement basis to State
Street. As of December 31, 2002, State Street had converted 6.0 million
shares of ESOP Preferred Stock to an equivalent 24.0 million common shares
and sold them on the open market, pursuant to the Form 144 as amended.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On December 9, 2002,
UAL filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to prevent the sale of UAL
common stock by substantial holders of equity or claims in order to protect
its net operating losses ("NOLs"). The Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary
injunction but permitted UAL to allow State Street to sell a certain number
of shares. In January 2003, State Street was allowed to convert an additional
3.2 million shares of ESOP Preferred Stock to an equivalent 12.8 million
common shares and sell them on the open market. On March 4, 2003, UAL announced
it had received a private letter ruling from the IRS which would allow
the Company to permit State Street to sell an additional 3.9 million shares
of UAL common stock without jeopardizing its NOLs. State Street then converted
0.9 million shares of ESOP Preferred Stock to an equivalent 3.9 million
common shares and sold them on the open market.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Also in September 2002,
the United Air Lines, Inc. Pension and Welfare Plans Administrative Committee
appointed AON Fiduciary Counselors, Inc. ("AON") as an independent fiduciary
for the UAL Stock Funds offered in the Company's 401(k) plans. On September
27, 2002, AON filed a Form 144 with the SEC to indicate it may sell up
to 10,577,325 shares of UAL common stock in the 401(k) plans. Simultaneous
with the filing of the Form 144, AON directed Fidelity Investments ("Fidelity")
and Frank Russell Trust Company ("Frank Russell") to cease the purchase
of UAL common stock and to raise the amount of cash held in the UAL Stock
Fund to 20% by selling UAL common stock. As of December 31, 2002, Fidelity
and Frank Russell had sold all of the UAL common stock previously held
by the plans.
</p><p><b><u>(14) Retirement and Postretirement Plans</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company has various retirement
plans, both defined benefit and defined contribution, which cover substantially
all employees. The Company also provides certain health care benefits,
primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as
certain life insurance benefits to retirees. The Company has reserved the
right, subject to collective bargaining agreements, to modify or terminate
the health care and life insurance benefits for both current and future
retirees. The amounts disclosed below do not reflect the impact of any
changes to the benefit plans that might be contemplated as a result of
the bankruptcy filing or negotiations with unions under the collective
bargaining agreements.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The following table sets
forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit
obligation and plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized
in the <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial Position</u> for the defined
benefit and other postretirement plans as of December 31:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Changes in interest rates
or rates of inflation may impact the assumptions used in the valuation
of pension obligations and postretirement obligations including discount
rates, rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation,
resulting in increases or decreases in United's pension and postretirement
liabilities and pension and postretirement costs.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The pension obligation
and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced.
Lowering the discount rate by 0.5% (from 6.75% to 6.25%) would increase
the Company's pension obligation at December 31, 2002 by approximately
$820 million and increase the estimated 2003 pension expense by approximately
$85 million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pension expense increases
as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets by 0.5% (from 9.0% to 8.5%) would
increase the estimated 2003 pension expense by approximately $40 million.
</p><p><b><u>(15) Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>General Guarantees
and Indemnifications. </i></b>In the normal course of business, the Company
enters into numerous real estate leasing and aircraft financing arrangements
that have various guarantees included in the contracts. These guarantees
are primarily in the form of indemnities. In both leasing and financing
transactions, the Company typically indemnifies the lessors, and any tax/financing
parties against tort liabilities that arise out of the use, occupancy,
operation or maintenance of the leased premises or financed aircraft. The
Company currently believes that any future payments required under these
guarantees or indemnities would be immaterial, as most tort liabilities
and related indemnities are covered by insurance (subject to deductibles).
Additionally, certain leased premises such as fueling stations or storage
facilities include indemnities of such parties for any environmental liability
that may arise out of or relate to the use of the leased premise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Financings and
Guarantees. </i></b>In addition to common commercial lease transactions,
United also enters into numerous long-term agreements to lease certain
airport and maintenance facilities which are financed through tax-exempt
special facilities revenue bonds and issued by various local municipalities
to build or improve airport and maintenance facilities. Under these lease
agreements, United is required to make rental payments in amounts sufficient
to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. At December
31, 2002, $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds was outstanding.
As of December 31, 2002, UAL and United had jointly guaranteed $35 million
of such bonds and United had guaranteed $1.2 billion of such bonds, including
accrued interest. The payments required to satisfy these obligations are
included in the future minimum lease payments disclosed in Note 11, "Lease
Obligations."
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Third Party Guarantees.
</i></b>In
conjunction with efforts to enhance the Star Alliance, in 1999 United agreed
to guarantee a portion of third-party debt. The guarantee is set to expire
in 2009 when the loan is due in full. United's maximum exposure to the
guaranteed loan is approximately $106 million and will only trigger if
the loan is in default. No liability was recorded by United at the time
of the guarantee. United earns commitment fees on the maximum guaranteed
amount of the loan. In addition, United may also earn drawdown fees on
the outstanding loan balance based on a calculated formula, requiring the
borrower to pay the incremental difference between United's credit rating
and the borrower's. Upon drawdown on the guaranteed loan, United can seek
reimbursement of the paid amount from the borrower plus interest at the
Federal funds rate plus 2%. United has subordinate security interests on
the aircraft purchased with the loan proceeds.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Fuel Consortiums.
</i></b>United
also participates in numerous fuel consortiums with other carriers at major
airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline
agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortium members
and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortium
based on usage. The consortiums (and in limited cases, the participating
carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport
fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through
tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general
airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general,
the consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments
in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments
on the bonds. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $450 million principal
amount of such bonds are direct indebtedness of fuel consortiums at major
hubs in which United participates. United's maximum exposure is approximately
$210 million principal amount of such bonds based on United's past consortium
participation and will only trigger if the other participating carriers
or consortiums members default on their lease payments. The guarantees
are set to expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges
from 2010 to 2028. No liability was recorded by United at the time the
indirect guarantees were made.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In January 2003, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities" ("FIN 46") which requires the consolidation of variable interest
entities ("VIEs"), as defined. The Company is still evaluating whether
special facilities revenue bonds and fuel consortiums should be considered
VIEs under FIN 46.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>EETC Debt.</i></b>
In 1997 and 2000, United issued EETCs to refinance certain owned aircraft
and aircraft under operating leases. A portion of these proceeds are direct
obligations of United and were recognized in the <u>Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position</u> while certain proceeds were place in trusts not
owned or affiliated with United. The proceeds placed in off-balance sheet
trusts were used to refinance the remaining bank debt of the lessors in
existing leveraged leases with United. As of December 31, 2002, approximately
$300 million of these proceeds were placed in off-balance sheet trusts.
For one of the trusts, United is the swap provider and pays fixed interest
and receives variable interest which converts the trust's variable rate
assets to fixed rate assets and converts United's variable rate lease payments
to fixed rate lease payments.
</p><p>The Company is still evaluating whether or not the EETC trusts are considered
VIEs under FIN 46.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Legal and Environmental
Contingencies. </i></b>The Company has certain contingencies resulting
from litigation and claims (including environmental issues) incident to
the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after considering
a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal
counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and
its prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies
is not expected to materially affect United's consolidated financial position
or results of operations.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United records liabilities
for legal and environmental claims against it in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. These amounts are recorded based on the
Company's assessments of the likelihood of their eventual settlements.
The amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near
term, based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims. In
addition, as a result of the bankruptcy filing, as of the Petition Date,
virtually all pending litigation is stayed, and absent further order of
the Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject to certain exceptions, may take
any action, again subject to certain exceptions, to recover on pre-petition
claims against the Debtors. Accordingly, the Company has classified certain
of these liabilities as liabilities subject to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b><i>Commitments.
</i></b>At
December 31, 2002, commitments for the purchase of property and equipment,
principally aircraft, approximated $1.6 billion, after deducting advance
payments. An estimated $0.1 billion will be spent in 2003, $0.3 billion
in 2004, $0.4 billion in 2005, $0.4 billion in 2006 and $0.4 billion in
2007 and thereafter. The major commitments are for the purchase of A319,
A320 and B777 aircraft, which are currently scheduled to be delivered through
2007.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In connection with the construction
of the Indianapolis Maintenance Center, United agreed to spend an aggregate
$800 million on capital investments by the year 2001 and employ at least
7,500 individuals by the year 2004. In the event such targets are not reached,
United may be required to make certain payments to the city of Indianapolis
and state of Indiana. As a result of the events of September 11 and the
subsequent reduction in the Company's operations, headcount and capital
spending, United repaid $34 million to the state and local governments
in June of 2002 and has accrued for the additional estimated liability
for 2004.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Approximately 80% of United's
employees are represented by various labor organizations. The contracts
with ALPA and the IAM become amendable in 2004 and with the AFA in 2006.
The Company is in the process of negotiating with its labor unions to amend
the existing contracts in light of the bankruptcy filing and United's need
to cut costs. As described in Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code," Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code permits the
Company to move to reject its labor contracts. On March 17, 2003, United
filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to reject its labor contracts
pursuant to Section 1113(c) and the Company expects to obtain a ruling
on the motion by early May.
</p><p><b><u>(16) Financial Instruments and Risk Management</u></b>
</p><p><b><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Derivative Financial
Instruments</i> -</b> Effective January 1, 2001, United adopted SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS
No. 133"), as amended. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a cumulative
credit of $3 million, net of tax, to 2001 earnings. This primarily related
to the changes in fair values of certain equity warrants that were not
designated as qualifying hedging instruments.
</p><p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Hedges of Future Cash Flows</i>
</p><p><i><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Foreign Currency</i>
-<b> </b>United enters into forwards and currency swaps to reduce exposure
to currency fluctuations on Japanese yen- and euro-denominated capital
lease obligations. The cash flows of the forwards and swaps mirror those
of the capital leases. These forwards and swaps have been designated as
cash flow hedges of the foreign currency denominated lease payments. For
these forwards and swaps, United excludes changes in fair value resulting
from changes in the forward points in its assessment of effectiveness.
Any gains or losses realized upon early termination of these forwards and
swaps are recorded (net of tax) as a component of other comprehensive income
and recognized in income as the hedged transaction impacts earnings. As
a result of the bankruptcy filing, all swaps and forwards were terminated
by the respective counterparties while out of the money. The outstanding
liabilities for these swaps and forwards are recorded as liabilities subject
to compromise.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company hedges some of
the risks of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future Japanese
yen, euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound revenues
by purchasing put options and on Hong Kong dollar revenues by entering
into forward contracts. These options and forwards have a duration of less
than one year and the amounts are synchronized with the expected cash receipts.
Accordingly, the put options and forwards have been designated as cash
flow hedges of the anticipated cash receipts. Changes in the fair value
of purchased put option contracts, to the extent they are effective, are
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (net of tax) and
then recognized as a component of passenger revenue when the underlying
hedged revenue is recorded. United excludes, in its assessment of effectiveness,
changes in the fair value of these instruments that are a result of changes
in their time value. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has no outstanding
currency hedges.
</p><p><i><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b>&#160; Aircraft Fuel</i>
- From time to time, United uses crude oil and heating oil forwards and
options to hedge a portion of its price risk related to aircraft fuel purchases.
These contracts have maturity dates of less than two years and have been
designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated jet fuel purchases. These
contracts are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value, to
the extent they are effective, recorded in other comprehensive income (net
of tax), until the underlying hedged fuel is consumed. The Company determines
the ineffective portion of the fuel forwards and options as the change
in the fair value of the hedge contracts compared to the change in expected
cash outflows for the hedged jet fuel. United excludes, in its assessment
of effectiveness, changes in the fair value of these instruments that are
a result of changes in their time value. As a result of the bankruptcy
filing, all fuel hedges were terminated by the respective counterparties.
The gain that resulted from the early termination of the hedges is recorded
as a component of other comprehensive income and will be reclassified into
earnings in the period of the original maturity of the hedges.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Interest Rate - </i>United
is a party to a series of interest rate swaps that convert floating-rate
operating leases to fixed-rate leases. United has designated these swaps
as cash flow hedges of the floating-rate leases and has recorded these
contracts at fair value with the effective portion recorded as a component
of other comprehensive income (net of tax). As of December 31, 2002, United
had $130 million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding with
a fair value to United of $(27) million.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The ineffectiveness resulting
from the changes in fair value of aircraft fuel and interest rate hedge
positions was immaterial. There was no ineffectiveness resulting from the
changes in fair value of foreign currency hedge positions reported in earnings.
Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness amounted to approximately
$1 million before income taxes and were recorded in "Miscellaneous, net."
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The following is a reconciliation
of current period changes of the portion of stockholders' equity relating
to derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Of this amount, $5 million
in losses is expected to be recorded into earnings within the next twelve
months. At December 31, 2002, the term of derivative instruments hedging
variability in cash flows, except those related to payment of variable
interest on existing financial instruments, was sixteen years.
</p><p><i>Other Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges</i>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Foreign Currency - </i>From
time to time, United enters into Japanese yen forward exchange contracts
to minimize gains and losses on the revaluation of short-term yen-denominated
liabilities. The yen forwards, typically having short-term maturities,
are not designated hedges under SFAS No. 133 and are marked to fair value
through the income statement at the end of each accounting period. The
unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses generally offset the losses
and gains recorded on the yen liabilities.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To reduce hedging costs,
the Company sells a correlation option denominated in Japanese yen, euros,
Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds. These correlation
options are not designated as a hedge and the changes in the fair market
value of the correlation options are included in "Miscellaneous, net."
</p><p><b><u>(17) Segment Information</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United has a global
route network designed to transport passengers and cargo between destinations
in North America, the Pacific, the Atlantic and Latin America. These regions
constitute United's four reportable segments.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In accordance with
DOT guidelines, the Company allocates passenger and cargo revenues for
the North America segment based on the actual flown revenue for flights
with an origin and destination in the U.S. Passenger and cargo revenue
for international segments is based on the actual flown revenue for flights
with an origin or destination in that segment. Other revenues that are
not directly associated with a flight (such as Red Carpet Club membership
fees) are allocated based on available seat miles flown in that segment.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The accounting policies
for each of these segments are the same as those described in Note 2, "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies," except that segment financial information
has been prepared using a management approach which is consistent with
how the Company's management internally disperses financial information
for the purpose of making internal operating decisions. United evaluates
performance based on earnings before income taxes, special charges and
gains on sales. A reconciliation of the total amounts reported by reportable
segments to the applicable amounts in the consolidated financial statements
follows:

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; United's operations involve
an insignificant level of dedicated revenue producing assets by reportable
segment. The overwhelming majority of United's revenue producing assets
can be deployed in any of the four reportable segments, as any given aircraft
may be used in multiple segments on any given day. Therefore, United allocates
depreciation and amortization expense associated with those assets on the
basis of available seat miles flown in each segment. In addition, United
has significant intangible assets related to the acquisition of its Atlantic
and Latin America route authorities.

<b>Option Grants by UAL in 2002</b>
<p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>United does not grant
stock options to its officers and employees. The table below provides information
about stock options that UAL granted during 2002 to the officers named
in the Summary Compensation Table.&#160; The hypothetical present values
of stock options granted in 2002 are calculated under a modified Black-Scholes
model, a mathematical formula used to value options.&#160; The actual amount
realized upon exercise of stock options will depend upon the amount by
which the market price of common stock on the date of exercise is greater
than the exercise price.&#160; The officers will not be able to realize
a gain from the stock options granted unless, during the exercise period,
the market price of common stock exceeds the exercise price of the options.

<p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>This table is based
on retirement at age 65 and selection of a straight life annuity (other
annuity options are available, which would reduce the amounts shown).&#160;
The amount of the normal retirement benefit under the plan is the product
of 1.63% times years of credited participation in the plan times final
average pay (highest five of last ten years of covered compensation).&#160;
The retirement benefit amount is not offset by the participant's social
security benefit.<font size="-1">&#160;</font>&#160; Compensation used in
calculating benefits under the plan includes base salary and amounts shown
as bonus in the Summary Compensation Table.&#160; Under the qualified plan,
years of participation for persons named in the compensation table are
as follows: Mr. Studdert - 7 years; Ms. Maher - 9 years; Mr. Hacker - 9
years; Mr. Brace - 14 years; Mr. Dutta - 17 years; Mr. McDonald - 31 years.&#160;
Mr. Tilton, who joined UAL in September of 2002, is not eligible to participate
in UAL's qualified plan until October 1, 2003. The amounts shown do not
reflect limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on retirement
benefits that may be paid under plans qualified under the code.&#160; United
has agreed to provide under non-qualified plans the portion of the retirement
benefits earned under the pension plan that would otherwise be subject
to code limitations.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>In light of the Company's
recent Chapter 11 filing, UAL and the Company are currently considering
the adoption of one pension plan for all of the Company's officers and
employees.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>If Mr. Hacker is employed
until age 50, he will be credited with additional years of participation
so that his total years of participation will equal 25.4 years.&#160; In
addition, if he is employed during the period between the date he attains
age 50 and the date he attains age 55, he will be credited with an additional
month of participation for each month of participation credited to him
during that period.&#160; If he remains employed past age 55, he will be
credited an additional 1/2 month of participation for each month of participation
credited to him after age 55.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Mr. Dutta and Mr.
Studdert continued to receive participation credit through February 15,
2003.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>In connection with
the hiring of Mr. Tilton, UAL and the Company agreed to provide a pension
make-whole payment, which is described below.
</p><center>
<p><b><u>Employment Contracts and Arrangements</u></b></p></center>
<p><b><u>Mr. Tilton's Employment Agreement</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Mr. Tilton was elected
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of UAL and United effective
September 2, 2002.&#160; UAL and the Company entered into a five-year employment
agreement with Mr. Tilton effective September 5, 2002, which agreement
was amended on December 8, 2002 and again on February 17, 2003 in connection
with the Company's bankruptcy filing.&#160; The amended agreement provides
for an annual base salary of $845,500 (which reflects an 11% reduction
from the original amount), and is subject to increases as part of the normal
salary program for UAL and the Company's senior executives.&#160; The agreement
provides Mr. Tilton a $3 million signing bonus, which Mr. Tilton will be
required to repay if he voluntarily resigns other than for good reason
or the Company terminates him for cause on or before the earlier of June
1, 2004 or the date a plan of reorganization is approved by the Bankruptcy
Court.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Under the terms of the agreement,
Mr. Tilton also received options to purchase 1,150,000 shares of UAL common
stock. The exercise price for the options is $3.03, which was the average
of the high and low sales price of the common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on August 30 and September 3, 2002.&#160; The options expire on
September 1, 2012.&#160; The Company also agreed to reimburse Mr. Tilton
for his and his family's relocation expenses, including a cash payment
to cover his income tax liability for the relocation reimbursement.&#160;
Under his employment agreement, Mr. Tilton is eligible to receive an annual
incentive bonus with a target percentage equal to 100% of his base salary.&#160;
He is entitled to an additional 100% over this target bonus amount for
superior performance.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>If Mr. Tilton's employment
is terminated by the Company without "cause," or by him for "good reason,"
or if there is a "change in control," the Company will pay him his base
salary as reduced by the December 8<sup>th</sup> amendment, any annual
bonus and any earned and vested benefits he may be entitled to through
the termination date.&#160; The Company will also pay Mr. Tilton a lump
sum payment equal to his base salary as reduced by the December 8<sup>th</sup>
amendment and target bonus multiplied by the greater of (1) the remaining
term of his agreement or (2) three years.&#160; Mr. Tilton's other benefits
will be continued for this period.&#160; All long-term incentive awards
will immediately vest on the termination date, including any unvested stock
options or restricted stock awards. Under Mr. Tilton's agreement, a "change
of control" is defined as: (1) a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially
all the Company's assets in which the voting securities of the Company
immediately before the merger, consolidation or sale represent less than
80% of the voting power after the merger, consolidation or sale; (2) the
acquisition by a person or group of 25% or more of the voting securities
of the Company; (3) the UAL shareholders approve any plan or proposal for
the liquidation of the Company; (4) a change in the majority of the UAL
Board of Directors over a 24-month period (unless the new directors were
approved by a two-thirds majority of prior directors); or (5) any other
event or transaction that the UAL Board of Directors determines is a change
of control.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>A "change of control"
will generally not arise as a result of events occurring prior to or on
account of a plan of reorganization of UAL under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, unless (1) there is a merger with another commercial airline and
the holders of the claims and/or interests in UAL before the merger have
less than 80% of the combined voting power after the merger; or (2) creditors
of UAL with an intent to control the management and policies of UAL on
an on-going basis acquire at least 25% of the voting securities of UAL;
or (3) a sale of the assets of UAL to another commercial airline, unless
the creditors and/or interest holders in UAL receive, directly or indirectly,
at least 80% of the combined voting power of the acquirer.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>In consideration of
projected retirement benefits foregone by Mr. Tilton as a result of his
resignation from his prior employer and acceptance of the Company's employment
offer, $4.5 million was paid into three secular trusts on Mr. Tilton's
behalf subject to ratable vesting over three years.&#160; The non-vested
portion is to be forfeited and returned to the Company if Mr. Tilton voluntarily
terminates employment for other than good reason or is terminated for cause.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>On February 21, 2003,
the Bankruptcy Court approved the Company's motion to assume Mr. Tilton's
amended employment agreement.
</p><p><b><u>Mr. Creighton's Retirement Arrangements</u></b>
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>In connection with
Mr. Creighton's retirement in 2002, UAL and United agreed that he would
remain as an on-call employee of United through year-end 2002.&#160; Although
Mr. Creighton did not receive a salary and bonus, he received benefits,
including medical, dental and life insurance, through December 31, 2002.&#160;
He also received a one-time cash payment of $250,000 as consideration for
his services.
</p><p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>In addition, Mr. Creighton's
temporary living expenses while working at UAL's headquarters in Chicago,
including the cost of a temporary residence (which could not exceed $3,000
per month) and a per diem allowance, continued to be paid by UAL through
November 2002.&#160; Through October 2002, UAL also provided Mr. Creighton
with office space located in the vicinity of his personal residence in
Seattle to be used primarily for UAL business while he was staying at his
personal residence.&#160; The reimbursement for this office space was limited
to $3,000 per month.
</p><p><b><u>Mr. Studdert's Agreement</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL, the Company and Mr.
Andrew Studdert recently entered into an agreement regarding Mr. Studdert's
recent termination as an executive officer of UAL and United.&#160; Under
the terms of the agreement, Mr. Studdert will remain an on-call employee
of UAL and United and will receive $1,000 per month through September 2004
unless the agreement is terminated earlier.&#160; During the term of the
agreement, Mr. Studdert will continue to provide services for United if
United reasonably requests such services.&#160; Mr. Studdert will continue
to receive the transportation benefit that United provides to its executive
officers, as well as other health and insurance benefits.&#160; Mr. Studdert
has agreed to forfeit all vested and unvested stock options granted under
UAL's equity incentive plans as well as any unvested restricted stock.&#160;
The agreement and Mr. Studdert's employment will terminate prior to September
2004 if Mr. Studdert voluntarily terminates his employment or, without
the Company's consent, accepts a position with a competitor of United or
he otherwise breaches the agreement.
</p><p><b><u>Mr. Dutta's Agreement</u></b>
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; UAL, the Company and Mr.
Rono Dutta recently entered into an agreement regarding Mr. Dutta's recent
termination as an executive officer of UAL and United.&#160; Under the
terms of the agreement, Mr. Dutta will remain an on-call employee of UAL
and United and will receive $2,000 per month through September 2004 unless
the agreement is terminated earlier.&#160; During the term of the agreement,
Mr. Dutta will continue to provide services for United if United reasonably
requests such services.&#160; Mr. Dutta will continue to receive the transportation
benefit that United provides to its executive officers, as well as other
health and insurance benefits.&#160; Mr. Dutta has agreed to forfeit all
vested and unvested stock options granted under UAL's equity incentive
plans as well as any unvested restricted stock.&#160; The agreement and
Mr. Dutta's employment will terminate prior to September 2004 if Mr. Dutta
voluntarily terminates his employment or, without the Company's consent,
accepts a position with a competitor of United or he otherwise breaches
the agreement. UAL has consented to Mr. Dutta serving on the board of directors
of US Airways and to him serving as a consultant to an investment banking
firm that may represent the American Airlines creditors' committee in the
event that airline were to file for bankruptcy protection.

the 90-day period prior to the filing of this report, an evaluation was
carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's
management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial
Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls
and procedures.&#160; Based on that evaluation, the Company's CEO and CFO
have concluded that United's disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.&#160; Subsequent to
the date of their evaluation, there were no significant changes in United's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the
disclosure controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses.
