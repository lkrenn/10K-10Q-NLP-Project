MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \\nForward-Looking Information  \\nThe discussions under Business, Risk Factors, Properties and Legal Proceedings\\nand the following discussions under Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of\\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative\\nDisclosures about Market Risk contain various forward-looking statements\\nwithin the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,\\nand Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which\\nrepresent the Company\\'s expectations or beliefs concerning future events. When\\nused in this document and in documents incorporated herein by reference, the\\nwords \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"indicates,\" \"believes,\" \"forecast,\"\\n\"guidance,\" \"outlook,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" and similar expressions are\\nintended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements\\ninclude, without limitation, the Company\\'s expectations concerning operations\\nand financial conditions, including changes in capacity, revenues, and costs,\\nfuture financing plans and needs, overall economic conditions, plans and\\nobjectives for future operations, and the impact on the Company of its results\\nof operations in recent years and the sufficiency of its financial resources\\nto absorb that impact. Other forward-looking statements include statements\\nwhich do not relate solely to historical facts, such as, without limitation,\\nstatements which discuss the possible future effects of current known trends\\nor uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or\\nuncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking\\nstatements in this report are based upon information available to the Company\\non the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly\\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new\\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. The Risk Factors listed in Item 1A,\\nin addition to other possible factors not listed, could cause the Company\\'s\\nactual results to differ materially from historical results and from those\\nexpressed in forward-looking statements.  \\nOverview  \\nThe Company recorded net earnings of $504 million in 2007, its second\\nconsecutive annual profit and a $273 million increase over 2006. Improved\\nresults reflected an increase in operating revenue of $372 million or 1.6\\npercent on 2.3 percent less capacity, partially offset by higher fuel prices\\nand increases in certain other costs. While the Company recorded positive\\nearnings in 2007 and 2006, it lost more than $8 billion in the five years\\nprior to 2006 and remains heavily indebted.  \\nThe Company\\'s improved revenue results were a function of stronger passenger\\nload factors and higher passenger yield. The Company\\'s 2007 load factor was\\n80.9 percent, 1.2 points higher year-over-year and its fifth consecutive year\\nof record load factor. Passenger yield, which is an industry measure of\\naverage fares, increased 2.4 percent versus 2006. However, passenger yield\\nremains low by historical standards and well below the Company\\'s peak yield\\nset in the year 2000. The Company believes this is the result of a fragmented\\nindustry with numerous competitors and excess capacity, increased low cost\\ncarrier competition, increased price competition due to the internet, and\\nother factors. Since deregulation in 1978, the Company\\'s passenger yield has\\nincreased 75 percent, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI), as measured by the\\nUS Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, has grown by 218 percent.\\nThe Company believes increases in passenger yield will continue to\\nsignificantly lag CPI indefinitely.  \\nOffsetting improved revenue, the Company\\'s fuel price increased from 201.4\\ncents to 213.1 cents per gallon year-over-year driving $365 million in\\nincremental expense. Since 2002, the Company\\'s fuel price has increased by\\n136.9 cents per gallon representing $4.3 billion in additional annual expense\\nbased on the Company\\'s 2007 fuel consumption. The Company\\'s fuel hedging\\nprogram offset $239 million in fuel expense in 2007.  \\nThe Company\\'s 2007 earnings reflect the continuing joint efforts between the\\nCompany and its employees to drive continuous revenue and cost improvement\\nunder the Turnaround Plan. This plan was established in 2003 and is the\\nCompany\\'s strategic framework for achieving sustained profitability and has\\nfour tenets: (i) lower costs to compete, (ii) fly smart - give customers what\\nthey value, (iii) pull together, win together and (iv) build a financial\\nfoundation.  \\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nUnder the Turnaround Plan, the Company has implemented hundreds of cost\\nsavings initiatives estimated to save approximately $3.8 billion in annual\\nexpense. In combination with the Company\\'s 2003 restructuring of labor and\\nother contracts, these initiatives have more than offset the Company\\'s non-\\nfuel inflationary and other cost pressures during this period. Although the\\nCompany\\'s cost per available seat mile increased from 11.54 cents in 2002 to\\n11.98 cents in 2007, the fuel component of unit cost increased from 1.43 cents\\nto 3.63 cents over the same period. All other components of unit cost\\ndecreased from 10.11 cents in 2002, to 8.35 cents in 2007, or 17.4 percent.\\nEmployee productivity (measured in available seat miles per full time\\nequivalent head) and aircraft productivity (measured in miles flown per day)\\nconsistently increased during this period.  \\nThe Company has also implemented numerous efforts to find additional revenue\\nsources and increase existing ones. In addition to improving core passenger\\nand cargo revenues, these efforts have contributed to an increase in Other\\nrevenue from $966 million in 2002 to $1.4 billion in 2007. Examples of new\\nrevenue sources over this period include onboard food sales, single day passes\\nfor AAdmirals Club admission, reservations ticketing fees, First Class\\nupgrades on day of departure, and numerous other initiatives.  \\nAs a key part of these efforts, the Company has sought to engage its labor\\nunions and its employees in jointly working together. The Company believes\\nheightened employee engagement has directly contributed to its progress under\\nthe Turnaround Plan.  \\nLastly, under the Turnaround Plan, the Company has worked to reduce debt,\\nincrease the funded status of employee pension plans and improve financial\\nflexibility for the future. Historically, airline industry earnings are highly\\ncyclical with frequent and extended periods of significant losses, and an\\nairline\\'s liquidity and borrowing capacity can be critical to sustaining\\noperations. The Company has reduced its balance sheet debt (Short-Term Debt\\nplus Long-Term Debt) from $13.2 billion at the end of 2002 to $11.1 billion at\\nyear end 2007. Over the same period, total Cash and Short-term investments\\n(including restricted cash and short-term investments) have increased by $2.3\\nbillion to $5.0 billion and the ratio of the fair value of plan assets to the\\naccumulated benefit obligations of the employee pension programs has increased\\nfrom 75 percent to 96 percent.  \\nOn November 28, 2007, the Company announced that it plans to divest AMR Eagle\\n(American Eagle Airlines, Inc., and Executive Airlines, Inc.), its wholly-\\nowned regional carrier. AMR believes that a divestiture of AMR Eagle is in the\\nlong-term best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Company\\ncontinues to evaluate the form of the divestiture, which may include a spin-\\noff to AMR shareholders, a sale to a third party, or some other form of\\nseparation from AMR. The Company expects to complete the divestiture in 2008;\\nhowever, the completion of any transaction and its timing will depend on a\\nnumber of factors, including general economic, industry and financial market\\nconditions, as well as the ultimate form of the divestiture. The impact on AMR\\nof divesting AMR Eagle is not currently quantifiable due to these\\nuncertainties and the potential restructuring of assets, liabilities and the\\ncapacity purchase agreement between American and AMR Eagle. In addition, AMR\\nEagle\\'s historical financial information is not indicative of the AMR Eagle\\'s\\nfuture results of operations, financial position and cash flows if AMR Eagle\\nhad been a stand-alone entity.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to become consistently profitable and its ability to\\ncontinue to fund it obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of\\nfactors, many of which are largely beyond the Company\\'s control. Certain risk\\nfactors that affect the Company\\'s business and financial results are discussed\\nin the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A. In addition, four of the Company\\'s\\nlargest domestic competitors have filed for bankruptcy in the last several\\nyears and have used this process to significantly reduce contractual labor and\\nother costs. In order to remain competitive and to improve its financial\\ncondition, the Company must continue to take steps to generate additional\\nrevenues and to reduce its costs. Although the Company has a number of\\ninitiatives underway to address its cost and revenue challenges, the ultimate\\nsuccess of these initiatives is not known at this time and cannot be assured.  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\nLiquidity and Capital Resources  \\nCash, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Assets At December 31, 2007, the\\nCompany had $4.5 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and\\n$428 million in restricted cash and short-term investments.  \\nSignificant Indebtedness and Future Financing Indebtedness is a significant\\nrisk to the Company as discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A. During\\n2005, 2006 and 2007, in addition to refinancing its Credit Facility and\\ncertain other debt (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), the\\nCompany raised an aggregate of approximately $2.5 billion in financing to fund\\ncapital commitments (mainly for aircraft and ground properties), debt\\nmaturities, and employee pension obligations, and to bolster its liquidity.\\nThe Company believes that it should have sufficient liquidity to fund its\\noperations for the foreseeable future, including repayment of debt and capital\\nleases, capital expenditures and other contractual obligations, including\\nthose relating to the anticipated accelerated delivery of 47 Boeing 737\\naircraft that American had previously committed to acquire in 2013 through\\n2015. Through December 31, 2007, the Company had advanced 18 of these\\ndeliveries and announced its intent to accelerate the remainder, depending on\\na number of factors including future economic conditions and the financial\\ncondition of the Company. In addition to advancing prior commitments, the\\nCompany had also ordered five incremental Boeing 737 aircraft. The Company\\ncontinues to examine its future aircraft needs and may need additional\\nfinancing to continue to execute its fleet renewal plan.  \\nHowever, because the Company has significant debt, lease and other obligations\\nin the next several years, including commitments to purchase aircraft as well\\nas substantial pension funding obligations (refer to Contractual Obligations\\nin this Item 7), the Company may need access to additional funding to maintain\\nsufficient liquidity. The Company currently has no committed financing for any\\naircraft that it is committed to purchase. The Company\\'s possible financing\\nsources primarily include: (i) a limited amount of additional secured aircraft\\ndebt (a most of the Company\\'s owned aircraft, including most of the Company\\'s\\nSection 1110-eligible aircraft, are encumbered) or sale-leaseback transactions\\ninvolving owned aircraft, (ii) debt secured by new aircraft deliveries, (iii)\\ndebt secured by other assets, (iv) securitization of future operating\\nreceipts, (v) the sale or monetization of certain strategic assets, (vi)\\nunsecured debt and (vii) issuance of equity and/or equity-like securities.\\nHowever, the availability and level of these financing sources cannot be\\nassured, particularly in light of the Company\\'s and American\\'s recent\\nfinancial results, substantial indebtedness, reduced credit ratings, high fuel\\nprices, revenues that are weak by historical standards, and the financial\\ndifficulties being experienced in the airline industry. The inability of the\\nCompany to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms could have a material\\nadverse impact on the Company and on the ability of the Company to sustain its\\noperations over the long-term.  \\nCredit Ratings AMR\\'s and American\\'s credit ratings are significantly below\\ninvestment grade. Additional reductions in AMR\\'s or American\\'s credit ratings\\ncould further increase its borrowing or other costs and further restrict the\\navailability of future financing.  \\nCredit Facility Covenants American has a secured bank credit facility which\\nconsists of an undrawn $255 million revolving credit facility with a final\\nmaturity on June 17, 2009, and a fully drawn $440 million term loan facility,\\nwith a final maturity on December 17, 2010 (the Revolving Facility and the\\nTerm Loan Facility, respectively, and collectively, the Credit Facility). On\\nMarch 30, 2007, American paid in full the principal balance of the Revolving\\nFacility and as of December 31, 2007, it remained undrawn. American\\'s\\nobligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by AMR.  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe Credit Facility contains a covenant (the Liquidity Covenant) requiring\\nAmerican to maintain, as defined, unrestricted cash, unencumbered short term\\ninvestments and amounts available for drawing under committed revolving credit\\nfacilities of not less than $1.25 billion for each quarterly period through\\nthe life of the Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Facility contains a\\ncovenant (the EBITDAR Covenant) requiring AMR to maintain a ratio of cash flow\\n(defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense (less capitalized\\ninterest), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals, adjusted\\nfor certain gains or losses and non-cash items) to fixed charges (comprising\\ninterest expense (less capitalized interest) and rentals). The required ratio\\nwas 1.40 to 1.00 for the four quarter period ending December 31, 2007 and will\\nincrease to 1.50 to 1.00 for the four quarter period ending June 30, 2009. AMR\\nand American were in compliance with the Liquidity Covenant and the EBITDAR\\ncovenant as of December 31, 2007 and expect to be able to continue to comply\\nwith these covenants. However, given fuel prices that are high by historical\\nstandards and the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, it is difficult to\\nassess whether AMR and American will, in fact, be able to continue to comply\\nwith these covenants, and there are no assurances that AMR and American will\\nbe able to do so. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a\\ndefault under the Credit Facility which - - if the Company did not take steps\\nto obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default - - could result in\\na default under a significant amount of the Company\\'s other debt and lease\\nobligations and otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company. See\\nNote 6 for further information regarding the Credit Facility. Cash Flow\\nActivity The Company\\'s cash flow from operating activities during the year\\nended December 31, 2007 generated $1.9 billion.  \\nCapital expenditures during 2007 were $714 million and primarily included\\naircraft modifications and the cost of improvements at JFK. Substantially all\\nof the Company\\'s construction costs at JFK are being reimbursed through a fund\\nestablished from a previous financing transaction. See Note 6 to the\\nconsolidated financial statements for additional information.  \\nThe Company also reduced long-term debt by $2.3 billion including prepayment\\nof approximately $1 billion in debt instruments.  \\nDuring the first quarter of 2007, the Company issued and sold 13 million\\nshares of its common stock. The Company realized $497 million from the equity\\nsale.  \\nDuring the third quarter of 2007, the Company sold its interests in ARINC,\\nIncorporated (\"ARINC\"), a military and aviation communications company. The\\nCompany received $192 million in proceeds for its interest in ARINC, $138\\nmillion of which was recognized as a gain.  \\nIn the past, the Company has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or\\nrepurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce its debt or lease\\nobligations or otherwise improve its balance sheet. Going forward, depending\\non market conditions, its cash positions and other considerations, the Company\\nmay continue to take such actions.  \\nCompensation As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements,\\nduring 2006 and January 2007, the AMR Board of Directors approved the\\namendment and restatement of all of the outstanding performance share plans,\\nthe related performance share agreements and deferred share agreements that\\nrequired settlement in cash.  The plans were amended to permit settlement in\\ncash and/or stock; however, the amendments did not impact the fair value of\\nthe awards under the plans.  These changes were made in connection with a\\ngrievance filed in 2006 by the Company\\'s three labor unions in which they\\nargued that the entirely cash settlement of the 2003-2005 Performance Unit\\nPlan may be contrary to a component of the Company\\'s 2003 Annual Incentive\\nProgram agreement with the unions.  \\nOn January 15, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of\\nAMR approved the 2008 Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) for American. All U.S. based\\nemployees of American are eligible to participate in the AIP. The AIP is\\nAmerican\\'s annual bonus plan and provides for the payment of awards in the\\nevent certain financial and/or customer service metrics are satisfied.  \\nWorking Capital AMR (principally American) historically operates with a\\nworking capital deficit, as do most other airline companies. In addition, the\\nCompany has historically relied heavily on external financing to fund capital\\nexpenditures. More recently, the Company has also relied on external financing\\nto fund operating losses, employee pension obligations and debt maturities.  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements American has determined that it holds a\\nsignificant variable interest in, but is not the primary beneficiary of,\\ncertain trusts that are the lessors under 84 of its aircraft operating leases.\\nThese leases contain a fixed price purchase option, which allows American to\\npurchase the aircraft at a predetermined price on a specified date. However,\\nAmerican does not guarantee the residual value of the aircraft. As of December\\n31, 2007, future lease payments required under these leases totaled $2.0\\nbillion.  \\nCertain special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain\\nmunicipalities primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities\\nthat are leased by American and accounted for as operating leases.\\nApproximately $1.7 billion of these bonds (with total future payments of\\napproximately $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2007) are guaranteed by\\nAmerican, AMR, or both. Approximately $395 million of these special facility\\nrevenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require American to\\nmake operating lease payments sufficient to repurchase the bonds at various\\ntimes: $218 million in 2008, $112 million in 2014 and $65 million in 2015.\\nAlthough American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no\\nassurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to\\nredeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce\\nexisting rent leveling accruals or be considered prepaid facility rentals and\\nwould reduce future operating lease commitments.  \\nIn addition, the Company had other operating leases, primarily for aircraft\\nand airport facilities, with total future lease payments of $4.1 billion as of\\nDecember 31, 2007. Entering into aircraft leases allows the Company to obtain\\naircraft without immediate cash outflows.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\nContractual Obligations  \\nThe following table summarizes the Company\\'s obligations and commitments as of\\nDecember 31, 2007 (in millions): |  |  Payments Due by Year(s) Ended December\\n31, |  \\n---|---|---|---  \\nContractual Obligations |  |  Total |  |  |  2008 |  |  |  2009 and 2010 |  |\\n|  2011 and 2012 |  |  |  2013 and Beyond |  \\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \\nOperating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations 1 |  | $ |\\n10,168 |  |  | $ | 1,037 |  |  | $ | 1,798 |  |  | $ | 1,535 |  |  | $ | 5,798\\n|  \\nFirm aircraft commitments 2 |  |  | 2,771 |  |  |  | 269 |  |  |  | 432 |  |\\n|  | 442 |  |  |  | 1,628 |  \\nCapacity purchase agreements 3 |  |  | 119 |  |  |  | 97 |  |  |  | 22 |  |  |\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  \\nLong-term debt 4 |  |  | 14,702 |  |  |  | 1,512 |  |  |  | 3,798 |  |  |  |\\n3,671 |  |  |  | 5,721 |  \\nCapital lease obligations |  |  | 1,369 |  |  |  | 243 |  |  |  | 324 |  |  |\\n| 243 |  |  |  | 559 |  \\nOther purchase obligations 5 |  |  | 1,139 |  |  |  | 323 |  |  |  | 355 |  |\\n|  | 308 |  |  |  | 153 |  \\nOther long-term liabilities 6, 7 |  |  | 3,051 |  |  |  | 255 |  |  |  | 408 |\\n|  |  | 542 |  |  |  | 1,846 |  \\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \\nTotal obligations and commitments |  |  | 33,319 |  |  |  | 3,736 |  |  |  |\\n7,137 |  |  |  | 6,741 |  |  |  | 15,705 |  \\n  \\n  \\n1. |  Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities - which are supported by operating leases executed by American - are guaranteed by AMR and/or American. The special facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions discussed above are included in this table under their ultimate maturity date rather than their mandatory tender provision date. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.   \\n---|---  \\n2. |  As of December 31, 2007, the Company had firm commitments to acquire 23 Boeing 737-800s in 2009 and an aggregate of 29 Boeing 737 aircraft and seven Boeing 777 aircraft in 2013 through 2015. Future payments for all aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, are currently estimated to be approximately $2.8 billion, with the majority occurring in 2011 through 2015. Additional information about the Company\\'s obligations is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.   \\n---|---  \\n3. |  The table reflects minimum required payments under capacity purchase contracts between American and two regional airlines, Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua) and Trans States Airlines Inc. If the Company terminates its contract with Chautauqua without cause, Chautauqua has the right to put its 15 Embraer aircraft to the Company. If this were to happen, the Company would take possession of the aircraft and become liable for lease obligations totaling approximately $21 million per year with lease expirations in 2018 and 2019. These lease obligations are not included in the table above. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  \\n---|---  \\n4. |  Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest. Interest on variable rate debt was estimated based on the current rate at December 31, 2007.  \\n---|---  \\n5. |  Includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services, primarily construction related costs at JFK and information technology related support. The Company has made estimates as to the timing of certain payments primarily for construction related costs. The actual timing of payments may vary from these estimates. Substantially all of the Company\\'s purchase orders issued for other purchases in the ordinary course of business contain a 30-day cancellation clause that allows the Company to cancel an order with 30 days notice.  \\n---|---  \\n6. |  Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and other postretirement benefit payments based on estimated payments through 2017. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.  \\n---|---  \\n7. |  Excludes a $2.1 billion accident liability, related to the Terrorist Attacks and flight 587, recorded in Other liabilities and deferred credits, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. This liability is offset in its entirety by a receivable, recorded in Other assets, which the Company expects to receive from insurance carriers as claims are resolved.  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\nPension Obligations The Company is required to make minimum contributions to\\nits defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of\\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company\\'s estimated\\n2008 contributions to its defined benefit pension plans are approximately $350\\nmillion, which exceeds the amount required to be contributed under the\\nprovisions of the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004 and the Pension\\nProtection Act of 2006.  \\nResults of Operations  \\nThe Company recorded net earnings of $504 million in 2007 compared to $231\\nmillion in 2006. The Company\\'s 2007 results reflected an improvement in\\nrevenues somewhat offset by fuel prices and certain other costs that were\\nhigher in 2007 compared to 2006. The 2007 and 2006 results were impacted by\\nproductivity improvements and by cost reductions resulting from progress under\\nthe Turnaround Plan. The 2007 results include the impact of several items\\nincluding: a $138 million gain on the sale of AMR\\'s stake in ARINC included in\\nOther Income, Miscellaneous - net, a $39 million gain to reflect the positive\\nimpact of the change to an 18-month expiration of AAdvantage miles included in\\nPassenger revenue, and a $63 million charge associated with the retirement and\\nplanned disposal of 24 MD-80 aircraft and certain other equipment that\\npreviously had been temporarily stored included in Other operating expenses.  \\nThe Company\\'s 2005 results were impacted by a $155 million aircraft charge, a\\n$73 million facility charge, an $80 million charge for the termination of a\\ncontract, a $37 million gain related to the resolution of a debt restructuring\\nand a $22 million credit for the reversal of an insurance reserve. All of\\nthese amounts are included in Other operating expenses in the consolidated\\nstatement of operations, except for a portion of the facility charge which is\\nincluded in Other rentals and landing fees. Also included in the 2005 results\\nwas a $69 million fuel tax credit. Of this amount, $55 million is included in\\nAircraft fuel expense and $14 million is included in Interest income in the\\nconsolidated statement of operations. The Company did not record a tax\\nprovision or benefit associated with its 2007 or 2006 earnings or 2005 losses.  \\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\nRevenues 2007 Compared to 2006 The Company\\'s revenues increased approximately\\n$372 million, or 1.6 percent, to $22.9 billion in 2007 compared to 2006.\\nAmerican\\'s passenger revenues increased by 2.1 percent, or $373 million,\\ndespite a capacity (available seat mile) (ASM) decrease of 2.4 percent.\\nAmerican\\'s passenger load factor increased 1.4 points to 81.5 percent and\\npassenger revenue yield per passenger mile increased 2.8 percent to 13.17\\ncents. This resulted in an increase in passenger revenue per available seat\\nmile (RASM) of 4.6 percent to 10.73 cents.

On a consolidated basis\\ncapacity is expected to be flat compared to 2007. This capacity forecast\\ndiffers from that provided on January 16, 2008, when the Company announced its\\nfourth quarter 2007 results.  The Company is analyzing the impact of this\\nplanned capacity reduction on the unit cost forecast provided on January 16.\\nThe Company expects to provide revised unit cost guidance in March 2008 in its\\nfirst quarter 2008 Eagle Eye investor update.  \\nOther Information  \\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Company\\'s\\nfinancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\\nthe amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\\nnotes. The Company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable;\\nhowever, actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts\\ncould differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following\\ncritical accounting policies and estimates used by management in the\\npreparation of the Company\\'s financial statements: accounting for long-lived\\nassets, routes, passenger revenue, frequent flyer program, stock compensation,\\npensions and other postretirement benefits, income taxes and derivatives\\naccounting.  \\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\nLong-lived assets - The Company has approximately $19 billion of long-lived\\nassets as of December 31, 2007, including approximately $17 billion related to\\nflight equipment and other fixed assets. In addition to the original cost of\\nthese assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of estimates made\\nby the Company, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and the\\nCompany\\'s determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently\\ngrounded. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\\n144, \"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\" (SFAS\\n144), the Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in\\noperations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be\\nimpaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those\\nassets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book\\nvalue of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In making these\\ndeterminations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not\\nlimited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets; and (ii) estimated future\\ncash flows expected to be generated by the assets, generally evaluated at a\\nfleet level, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset\\nutilization, length of service and estimated salvage values. A change in the\\nCompany\\'s fleet plan has been the primary indicator that has resulted in an\\nimpairment charge in the past.  \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company permanently grounded and held for\\ndisposal 24 McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airframes and certain other equipment, all\\n24 of which had previously been in temporary storage. See further discussion\\nin Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  \\nAll of American\\'s fleet types are depreciated over 30 years except for the\\nAirbus A300 and the Boeing 767-200. It is possible that the ultimate lives of\\nthe Company\\'s aircraft will be significantly different than the current\\nestimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact the Company\\'s\\nfleet plan, including positive or negative developments in the areas described\\nabove. For example, operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in\\nhigher maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if the Company\\nreplaced the aircraft. At some point in the future, higher operating costs\\nand/or improvement in the Company\\'s economic condition could change the\\nCompany\\'s analysis of the impact of retaining aircraft versus replacing them\\nwith new aircraft.  \\nRoutes \\\\- AMR performs annual impairment tests on its routes, which are\\nindefinite life intangible assets under Statement of Financial Accounting\\nStandard No. 142 \"Goodwill and Other Intangibles\" and as a result they are not\\namortized. The Company also performs impairment tests when events and\\ncircumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. These tests are\\nprimarily based on estimates of discounted future cash flows, using\\nassumptions based on historical results adjusted to reflect the Company\\'s best\\nestimate of future market and operating conditions. The net carrying value of\\nassets not recoverable is reduced to fair value. The Company\\'s estimates of\\nfair value represent its best estimate based on industry trends and reference\\nto market rates and transactions.  \\nThe Company had recorded route acquisition costs (including international\\nroutes and slots) of $846 million as of December 31, 2007, including a\\nsignificant amount related to operations at London Heathrow. The Company has\\ncompleted an impairment analysis on the London Heathrow routes (including\\nslots) and has concluded that no impairment exists. The Company believes its\\nestimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, given the significant\\nuncertainty regarding how the recent open skies agreement will ultimately\\naffect the Company\\'s operations at Heathrow, the actual results could differ\\nfrom those estimates. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for\\nadditional information.  \\n|  Passenger revenue - Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a\\ncomponent of Air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is\\nrecognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors,\\nincluding the industry\\'s pricing structure and interline agreements throughout\\nthe industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates\\nregarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue\\nto be recognized, including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon\\nthe evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression analysis\\nand other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the Company\\'s\\nhistorical experience, and are recognized at the scheduled time of departure.\\nThe Company\\'s estimation techniques have been applied consistently from year\\nto year. However, due to changes in the Company\\'s ticket refund policy and\\nchanges in the travel profile of customers, historical trends may not be\\nrepresentative of future results.  \\n---|---  \\n  \\nVarious taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are\\ncollected by the Company as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These\\ntaxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying\\nconsolidated statement of operations and recorded as a liability until\\nremitted to the appropriate taxing authority.  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\nFrequent flyer program - American uses the incremental cost method to account\\nfor the portion of its frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage\\nmembers earn mileage credits by flying on American or its regional affiliates.\\nIn 2007, the Company changed its policy regarding the life of AAdvantage\\nmileage credits. Effective December 15, 2007, AAdvantage members now must have\\nmileage earning or redemption activity at least once every eighteen (18)\\nmonths in order to remain active and retain their miles. Prior to this change,\\nmileage credits automatically expired after thirty-six (36) months of\\ninactivity in the AAdvantage member\\'s account. The Company recorded a one-time\\nbenefit of $39 million as a component of passenger revenue in 2007 to reflect\\nthe impact of the additional miles expiring upon the change of expiration\\nperiod for AAdvantage mileage.  \\nThe Company considers breakage in its incremental cost calculation and\\nrecognizes breakage on AAdvantage miles sold over the estimated period of\\nusage for sold miles that are ultimately redeemed. The Company calculates its\\nbreakage estimate using separate breakage rates for miles earned by flying on\\nAmerican and miles earned through other companies who have purchased\\nAAdvantage miles for distribution to their customers, due to differing\\nbehavior patterns.  \\nManagement considers historical patterns of account breakage to be a useful\\nindicator when estimating future breakage. Future program redemption\\nopportunities can significantly alter customer behavior from historical\\npatterns with respect to inactive accounts. Such changes may result in\\nmaterial changes to the deferred revenue balance, as well as recognized\\nrevenues from the program.  \\nAmerican includes fuel, food, passenger insurance and reservations/ticketing\\ncosts in the calculation of incremental cost. These estimates are generally\\nupdated based upon the Company\\'s 12-month historical average of such costs.\\nAmerican also accrues a frequent flyer liability for the mileage credits\\nexpected to be used for travel on participating airlines based on historical\\nusage patterns and contractual rates.  \\nRevenue earned from selling AAdvantage miles to other companies is recognized\\nin two components. The first component represents the revenue for air\\ntransportation sold and is valued at fair value. This revenue is deferred and\\nrecognized over the period the mileage is expected to be used, which is\\ncurrently estimated to be 28 months. The second revenue component,\\nrepresenting the marketing services sold, is recognized as related services\\nare provided.  \\nThe Company\\'s total liability for future AAdvantage award redemptions for\\nfree, discounted or upgraded travel on American, American Eagle or\\nparticipating airlines as well as unrecognized revenue from selling AAdvantage\\nmiles to other companies was approximately $1.6 billion at both December 21,\\n2007 and 2006 (and is recorded as a component of Air traffic liability in the\\nconsolidated balance sheets), representing 19.2 percent and 18.3 percent of\\nAMR\\'s total current liabilities, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  \\nThe number of free travel awards used for travel on American and American\\nEagle was 2.6 million in 2007 and 2.6 million in 2006 representing\\napproximately 7.5 percent of passengers boarded in each year. The Company\\nbelieves displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given the Company\\'s\\nload factors, its ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory, and the\\nrelatively low ratio of free award usage to total passengers boarded.  \\nChanges to the percentage of the amount of revenue deferred, deferred\\nrecognition period, percentage of awards expected to be redeemed for travel on\\nparticipating airlines, breakage or cost per mile estimates could have a\\nsignificant impact on the Company\\'s revenues or incremental cost accrual in\\nthe year of the change as well as in future years.  \\nStock Compensation - Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair\\nvalue recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards\\nNo. 123(R) \"Share-Based Payment\". The Company grants awards under its various\\nshare based payment plans and utilizes option pricing models or fair value\\nmodels to estimate the fair value of its awards. Certain awards contain a\\nmarket performance condition, which is taken into account in estimating the\\nfair value on the date of grant.  The fair value of those awards is estimated\\nusing a Monte Carlo valuation model that estimates the probability of the\\npotential payouts of these awards, using the historical volatility of the\\nCompany\\'s stock and the stock of other carriers in the competitor group. The\\nCompany accounts for these awards over the three year term of the award based\\non the grant date fair value, provided adequate shares are available to settle\\nthe awards.  For awards where adequate shares are not anticipated to be\\navailable or that only permit settlement in cash, the fair value is re-\\nmeasured each reporting period.  \\nPensions and other postretirement benefits - On December 31, 2006, the Company\\nadopted Statement of Accounting Standard 158 \"Employers\\' Accounting for\\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans\" (SFAS 158). SFAS 158\\nrequired the Company to recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference\\nbetween the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations)\\nof its pension and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet as\\nof December 31, 2006 with a corresponding adjustment to Accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income (loss).  \\nThe Company\\'s pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities\\nare calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. The\\nCompany uses certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection\\nof the: (i) discount rate; (ii) expected return on plan assets; and (iii)\\nexpected health care cost trend rate and starting in 2007, the (iv) estimated\\nage of pilot retirement (as discussed below).  \\nThese assumptions as of December 31 were:  \\n  \\n|  2007 |  |  2006  \\n---|---|---|---  \\nDiscount rate |  6.50% |  |  6.00%  \\nExpected return on plan assets |  8.75% |  |  8.75%  \\nExpected health care cost trend rate: |  |  |  \\nPre-65 individuals |  |  |  \\nInitial |  7.0% |  |  9.0%  \\nUltimate |  4.5% |  |  4.5%  \\nPost-65 individuals |  |  |  \\nInitial |  7.0% |  |  9.0%  \\nUltimate (2010) |  4.5% |  |  4.5%  \\nPilot Retirement Age |  63 |  |  60  \\n  \\n  \\nThe Company\\'s discount rate is determined based upon the review of year-end\\nhigh quality corporate bond rates. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis\\npoints as of December 31, 2007 would increase the Company\\'s pension and\\npostretirement benefits obligations by approximately $710 million and $145\\nmillion, respectively, and increase estimated 2008 pension and postretirement\\nbenefits expense by $27 million and $6 million, respectively.  \\nThe expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of the\\nCompany\\'s historical trends and experience taking into account current and\\nexpected market conditions and the Company\\'s target asset allocation of 40\\npercent longer duration corporate bonds, 25 percent U.S. value stocks, 20\\npercent developed international stocks, five percent emerging markets stocks\\nand bonds and ten percent alternative (private) investments. The expected\\nreturn on plan assets component of the Company\\'s net periodic benefit cost is\\ncalculated based on the fair value of plan assets and the Company\\'s target\\nasset allocation. The Company monitors its actual asset allocation and\\nbelieves that its long-term asset allocation will continue to approximate its\\ntarget allocation. The Company\\'s historical annualized ten-year rate of return\\non plan assets, calculated using a geometric compounding of monthly returns,\\nis approximately 10.39 percent as of December 31, 2007. Lowering the expected\\nlong-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31,\\n2007 would increase estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately $45\\nmillion.  \\nThe health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of the Company\\'s\\nhistorical trends and experience taking into account current and expected\\nmarket conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100\\nbasis points would increase estimated 2008 postretirement benefits expense by\\n$25 million.  \\nOn December 13, 2007, President Bush signed the Fair Treatment for Experienced\\nPilots Act (H.R. 4343) into law, raising the mandatory retirement age for\\ncommercial pilots from 60 to 65. Previously, The Federal Aviation\\nAdministration required commercial pilots to retire once they reached age 60.\\nThe Company\\'s pilot pension and other postretirement plans continue to permit\\na pilot to retire as before at age 60, but the Company believes that many\\npilots will choose to fly past age 60. As a result of the new legislation, the\\nCompany has estimated the average retirement age for the pilot workgroup to be\\n63, based on the approximate retirement age of the Company\\'s other work\\ngroups, which did not have the same mandatory retirement age. This change in\\nthe estimate caused a decrease to the pension and other postretirement\\nliability of approximately $540 million. See Note 10 to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements for additional information.  \\nThe U.S. Congress is also considering legislation that would amend the Pension\\nProtection Act of 2006. The Company has not completed its evaluation of the\\nimpact of the proposed legislation; however, if enacted the proposed\\nlegislation could materially increase the Company\\'s minimum required\\ncontributions to its defined benefit pension plans. Income taxes - The Company\\ngenerally believes that the positions taken on previously filed income tax\\nreturns are more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities.\\nThe Company has recorded income tax and related interest liabilities where the\\nCompany believes its position may not be sustained or where the full income\\ntax benefit will not be recognized. In accordance with the standards of\\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 \"Accounting for\\nUncertainty in Income Taxes- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN\\n48), the effects of potential income tax benefits resulting from the Company\\'s\\nunrecognized tax positions are not reflected in the tax balances of the\\nfinancial statements. Recognized and unrecognized tax positions are reviewed\\nand adjusted as events occur that affect the Company\\'s judgment about the\\nrecognizability of income tax benefits, such as lapsing of applicable statutes\\nof limitations, conclusion of tax audits, release of administrative guidance,\\nor rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax position. Under\\nFAS 109, the Company records a deferred tax asset valuation allowance when it\\nis more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets\\nwill not be realized. The Company considers its historical earnings, trends,\\nand outlook for future years in making this determination. The Company had a\\ndeferred tax valuation allowance of $625 million, and $1.3 billion,\\nrespectively, at December 31, 2007 and 2006. See Note 8 to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements for additional information.  \\nDerivatives - In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards\\nNo. 133, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity\" (SFAS\\n133), the Company assesses, both at the inception of each hedge and on an on-\\ngoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions\\nare highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items.\\nIn doing so, the Company uses a regression model to determine the correlation\\nof the change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g. NYMEX\\nHeating oil) to the change in the price of jet fuel purchases. The Company\\nalso monitors the actual dollar offset of the hedges\\' market values as\\ncompared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The fuel hedge contracts are\\ngenerally deemed to be \"highly effective\" if the R-squared is greater than 80\\npercent and the hedge is expected to continue to remain effective at\\noffsetting jet fuel price changes. The Company discontinues hedge accounting\\nprospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer expected to be\\nhighly effective as a hedge. As of December 31 2007, the Company had\\nderivative contracts with a value of $416 million including a receivable\\nrelated to contracts that settled in December. A deferred gain of $240 million\\nwas recorded in Other comprehensive income at December 31, 2007 and will be\\nrecognized in future periods as contracts settle.  \\nNew Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting\\nStandards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\\n157 \"Fair Value Measurements\" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 introduces a framework for\\nmeasuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value\\nmeasurements of assets and liabilities. On February 6, 2008 the FASB issued a\\nfinal FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-b, \"Effective Date of FASB\\nStatement No. 157\". This FSP delays the effective date of FASB Statement No.\\n157, Fair Value Measurements, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial\\nliabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in\\nthe financial statements on a recurring basis. In addition, the FSP removes\\ncertain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS 157. The effective date of\\nSFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities has been delayed by one year\\nto fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within\\nthose fiscal years. SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities is effective\\nfor fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and the Company will adopt\\nthe standard for those assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2008. The\\nprincipal impact to the Company will be to require the Company to expand its\\ndisclosure regarding its derivative instruments and to include credit risk as\\na part of the calculation of the fair value of derivatives. Although the\\nCompany continues to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this standard on\\nits consolidated financial statements, the Company believes the impact of\\nadoption will be immaterial.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n<font style=\"DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY:\\nTimes New Roman\"\\n\\n'"
