<br>
<p><b>ITEM 1.&nbsp; BUSINESS.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL Corporation ("UAL" or
the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on December 30, 1968. The world headquarters of the Company are located
at 1200 East Algonquin Road, Elk Grove Township, Illinois 60007.&nbsp;
The Company' s mailing address is P.O. Box 66919, Chicago, Illinois 60666.&nbsp;
The telephone number for the Company is (847) 700-4000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company is a holding
company and its principal subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("United"), which is wholly owned.&nbsp; United accounted for
virtually all of the Company' s revenues and expenses in 2000.&nbsp; United
is a major commercial air transportation company, engaged in the transportation
of persons, property and mail throughout the U.S. and abroad.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Airline Operations</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, United carried,
on average, more than 231,000 passengers per day and flew more than 126
billion revenue passenger miles.&nbsp; It is the world' s largest airline
as measured by revenue passenger miles flown, providing passenger service
in 28 countries.&nbsp; United' s network, supplemented with strategic airline
alliances, provides comprehensive transportation service within its North
America segment and to international destinations within its Pacific, Atlantic,
and Latin America segments.&nbsp; Operating revenues attributed to United'
s North America segment were $13.1 billion in 2000, $12.5 billion in 1999
and $12.0 billion in 1998.&nbsp; Operating revenues attributed to United'
s international segments were $6.2 billion in 2000, $5.5 billion in 1999
and $5.5 billion in 1998.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>North America</u></b>.&nbsp;
United operates hubs in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Washington Dulles and has the most extensive U.S. route system of any airline,
ranking first in capacity share in all of its U.S. hubs.&nbsp; Within the
North America segment, United also operates United Shuttle&reg;, which
is designed to provide high-frequency air service in competitive markets,
as well as critical traffic feed to United' s mainline operations.&nbsp;
United Shuttle is principally concentrated on the West Coast and in Denver.&nbsp;
United Shuttle offers approximately 455 daily flights on 30 routes among
23 cities in the western U.S.&nbsp; United' s North America operations
accounted for 67.7% of United' s revenues in 2000<font face="Courier">.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Pacific</u></b>.&nbsp;
Via its Tokyo hub, United provides passenger service between its U.S. gateway
cities (Chicago, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle)
and the Asian cities of Bangkok, Hong Kong, Seoul, Shanghai and Singapore.&nbsp;
United also provides nonstop service between Hong Kong and each of Chicago,
Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Singapore; between San Francisco and each
of Beijing, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney and Taipei; and between Los
Angeles and each of Auckland, Melbourne and Sydney.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November 2000, United
received authority to fly two additional frequencies to China.&nbsp; The
new authority allows United to operate daily service between San Francisco
and Shanghai.&nbsp; Additionally, United plans to resume around-the-world
service in April 2001, adding service between Delhi and each of London
and Hong Kong.&nbsp; Also during April 2001, United plans to add nonstop
service between New York and Hong Kong.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air services agreement
between the U.S. and Japan provides an unlimited number of frequencies
to United and certain other carriers.&nbsp; United also holds significant
traffic rights beyond Japan.&nbsp; These rights will allow United to add
service from Japan to other Asian points as regulatory, competitive and
economic conditions warrant.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2000, United was the leading
U.S carrier in the Pacific in terms of transpacific available seat miles
and the most flights available.&nbsp; United' s Pacific operations accounted
for 16.4% of United' s revenues in 2000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Atlantic</u></b>.&nbsp;
During 2000, Washington-Dulles served as United' s primary gateway to Europe,
serving Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Milan, Munich, and Paris.&nbsp;
Chicago has become United' s secondary European gateway, offering nonstop
service in 2000 to each of Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, London and Paris.&nbsp;
United also provides nonstop service between: London and Boston, Los Angeles,
Newark, New York and San Francisco; Paris and each of Los Angeles and San
Francisco; and between Frankfurt and San Francisco.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February 2001, United
inaugurated nonstop service between Chicago and Amsterdam.&nbsp; In April
2001, United plans to discontinue service between London and each of Amsterdam
and Brussels, concurrent with the resumption of service between London
and Delhi.&nbsp; In June 2001, United plans to add seasonal service between
Denver and Frankfurt.&nbsp; In 2000, United' s Atlantic operations accounted
for 11.7% of United' s operating revenues.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Latin America</u></b>.&nbsp;
During 2000, United' s primary gateway to Latin America was Miami, providing
passenger service between Miami and each of Buenos Aires, Caracas, Montevideo,
Rio de Janeiro, Santiago and Sao Paolo.&nbsp; United also provided service
between Los Angeles and each of Guatemala City, Mexico City, and San Salvador;
between New York and each of Buenos Aires, Sao Paolo, and San Juan; between
Chicago and each of Aruba, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, San Juan, St. Thomas,
and Sao Paolo; between Mexico City and each of San Francisco and Washington
Dulles; and between Washington-Dulles and St. Thomas.&nbsp; United also
provides service between San Jose, Costa Rica and each of Mexico City and
Guatemala City.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newly amended air services
agreement between the U.S. and Argentina provides for additional capacity
in the U.S.-Argentina market and enables United to operate any size aircraft
on any or all of its 21 weekly flights to Argentina without restriction.&nbsp;
Prior to this amendment, United and American Airlines were the only U.S.
passenger carriers operating between the U.S. and Argentina.&nbsp; Under
the new agreement, Delta and Continental have each been awarded access
to Argentina and will respectively commence daily service in April and
December 2001.&nbsp; In 2000, United' s Latin America operations accounted
for 4.2% of United' s revenues.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial information relative
to the Company' s operating segments can be found in Note 19 in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u> in this Form 10-K.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>US Airways Acquisition</u>.&nbsp;
</b>During 2000, UAL announced plans to acquire US Airways Group, Inc.
in an all-cash transaction for $4.3 billion.&nbsp; The Company expects
that the new network created by the acquisition will make travel more convenient
for passengers, connecting US Airways eastern U.S. markets with United'
s extensive east-west and international networks, and create the nation'
s most comprehensive airline network.&nbsp; This transaction, which the
Company anticipates closing in the second quarter of 2001, is still subject
to regulatory clearance and other customary closing conditions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, UAL and AMR
Corporation announced in January 2001 the approval of a binding memorandum
of understanding, under which American Airlines will provide competitive
service on key hub-to-hub routes where United and US Airways currently
are the only competitors with non-stop flights.&nbsp; In addition, UAL
will transfer assets that would have been surplus to the needs of the combined
United/US Airways operations, consisting of gates, slots and up to 86 aircraft.&nbsp;
AMR will pay UAL approximately $1.2 billion in cash for this transaction
and assume certain US Airways obligations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information on the
US Airways acquisition, see "US Airways Acquisition" in <u>Item 7. Management'
s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</u>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>United Cargo<sup>&reg;</sup></u></b>.
United Cargo generated over $900 million in freight and mail revenue.&nbsp;
As a part of United' s decision to retire its remaining DC-10 passenger
aircraft, United Cargo discontinued its international freighter operation
on December 24, 2000.&nbsp; With United' s growing fleet of cargo-friendly
widebody aircraft, however, it is expected that revenues will continue
to increase through time-sensitive delivery services, e-commerce initiatives
and customer loyalty programs.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United Cargo' s premium international
time-definite service, TD.Guaranteed, was expanded to more U.S. destinations
with intra-U.S. connections, which more than doubled TD.Guaranteed revenue
since the product was introduced in 1999.&nbsp; In addition, another time-sensitive
product, United Sameday, was introduced in 2000 for the small package,
door-to-door delivery service, which may be booked via a toll-free number
or the Internet (<font size=-1>www.unitedsameday.com)</font>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Fuel</u>.</b>&nbsp;
Changes in fuel prices are industry-wide occurrences that benefit or harm
United' s competitors as well as United.&nbsp; Fuel-hedging activities
may affect the degree to which fuel-price changes affect individual companies.&nbsp;
To assure adequate supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of control
over fuel costs, United ships fuel on major pipelines and stores fuel close
to its major hub locations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United' s results of operations
are significantly affected by the price and availability of jet fuel.&nbsp;
It is estimated that, absent hedging, every $.01 change in the average
annual price-per-gallon of jet fuel causes a change of approximately $31
million in United' s annual fuel costs.&nbsp; United' s average price per
gallon of jet fuel in 2000 increased 40%, as compared to the previous year.&nbsp;
However, the average price of spot jet fuel in the U.S. Gulf Coast increased
71% during that same period.&nbsp; United' s price in 2000 was mitigated
by a fuel hedging program that was primarily an options-based strategy,
through which the upside was retained while the downside was eliminated.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insurance</u></b>.&nbsp;
United carries liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation
industry, in amounts which it deems adequate, covering passenger liability,
public liability, property damage liability, and physical damage insurance
on United' s aircraft and property.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Marketing Strategy</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides offering convenient
scheduling throughout its domestic and international segments, United seeks
to attract high yield customers and create customer preference by providing
a comprehensive network, an attractive frequent-flyer program, and enhanced
service initiatives.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Alliances</u></b>.&nbsp;
United has formed bilateral alliances with other airlines to provide its
customers more choices and to participate worldwide in markets that it
cannot serve directly for commercial or governmental reasons.&nbsp; An
alliance is a collaborative marketing arrangement between carriers, which
can include joint frequent flyer participation, code-sharing of flight
operations, coordination of reservations, baggage handling, and flight
schedules, and other resource sharing activities.&nbsp; "Code-sharing"
is an agreement under which a carrier' s flights can be marketed under
the two-letter airline designator code of another carrier.&nbsp; Through
an alliance, carriers can provide their customers a seamless global travel
network under their own airline code.&nbsp;&nbsp; United now participates
in a multilateral alliance, the Star Alliance<font face="Symbol">&Ocirc;</font>
<font size=-2>.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Star Alliance is an integrated
worldwide transport network, which provides customers with global recognition
and a wide range of other benefits.&nbsp; Collectively, the Star Alliance
carriers served more than 815 destinations in over 130 countries during
2000.&nbsp; The Star Alliance enables its member carriers to more effectively
compete with other worldwide alliances.&nbsp; Founded in 1997 by United
and five other carriers, the Star Alliance has grown to fifteen carriers.&nbsp;
Besides United, the Star Alliance includes:&nbsp; Air Canada, Air New Zealand,
All Nippon Airways, Ansett Australia, Austrian Airlines, British Midland,
Lauda Air, Lufthansa, Mexicana, SAS, Singapore Airways, Thai International
Airways, Tyrolean and Varig.&nbsp; United currently holds bilateral immunity
with Air Canada and integrated antitrust immunity with Lufthansa, SAS,
and the Austrian Group.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has also formed independent
alliances with other air carriers.&nbsp; Current agreements exist between
United and each of Aeromar, ALM Antillean, Aloha, BWIA, Cayman Airways,
Continental Connection, Emirates, Saudi Arabian Airlines, and Spanair.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, United has a
marketing program in North America known as United Express<sup><font size=-2>&reg;</font></sup>,
under which independent regional carriers, utilizing turboprop equipment
and regional jets, feed United' s major airports and international gateways.&nbsp;
The carriers in the United Express program serve small and medium-sized
cities in the U.S., linking those cities to United' s hubs.&nbsp; United
Express carriers include Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation, Atlantic Coast
Airlines, Great Lakes Aviation and Sky West Airlines.&nbsp; Effective May
1, 2001, Great Lakes Aviation will no longer be a United Express carrier,
but will continue its relationship with United as an alliance carrier.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Mileage Plus<sup>&reg;</sup></u>.&nbsp;
</b>United established the frequent flyer program to develop and retain
passenger loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers.&nbsp;
Over 40 million members have enrolled in Mileage Plus since it was started
in 1981.&nbsp; Mileage Plus members earn mileage credit for flights on
United, United Shuttle, United Express, the Star Alliance carriers and
certain other airlines which participate in the program.&nbsp; Miles can
also be earned by utilizing the goods and services of non-airline program
participants, such as hotels, car rental companies, bank credit card issuers,
and a variety of other businesses.&nbsp; Mileage credits can be redeemed
for free, discounted or upgrade travel awards on United and other participating
airlines, or, to a limited extent, other travel and non-travel industry
awards.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travel awards can be redeemed
at the "Standard" level for any unsold seat on any United flight to every
destination served by United.&nbsp; Redemption at the "Saver" award level,
however, is restricted with blackout dates and capacity controlled inventory,
thereby limiting the use of Saver awards on certain flights.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a travel award level
is attained, liability is recorded for the incremental costs of providing
travel, based on expected redemptions.&nbsp; United' s incremental costs
include the additional costs of providing service to the award recipient,
such as fuel, meal, personnel and ticketing costs, for what would otherwise
be a vacant seat.&nbsp; The incremental costs do not include any contribution
to overhead or profit.&nbsp; For mileage sold to other program participants
prior to January 1, 2000, revenue was recognized when the miles were sold.&nbsp;
Beginning January 1, 2000, a portion of revenue from the sale of mileage
is deferred and recognized when the transportation is provided. (See Item
8, Note 1(i) "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Mileage Plus
Awards" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.)
<br>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000, the
estimated number of outstanding awards was approximately 10.8 million,
as compared with 7.0 million at the end of the prior year.&nbsp; United
estimates that 8.9 million of such awards will ultimately be redeemed and,
accordingly, has recorded a liability amounting to $564 million, which
includes the deferred revenue from the sale of miles to program participants.&nbsp;
Based on historical data, the difference between the awards expected to
be redeemed and the total awards outstanding arises because:&nbsp; (1)
some awards will never be redeemed, (2) some will be redeemed for non-travel
benefits, and (3) some will be redeemed on partner carriers.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2000, 1.97 million Mileage
Plus travel awards were used on United.&nbsp; This number represents the
number of awards for which travel was actually provided in 2000 and not
the number of seats that were allocated to award travel.&nbsp; In 1999,
2.24 million awards were used, while 2.13 million awards were used in 1998.&nbsp;
Such awards represented 7.2% of United' s total revenue passenger miles
in 2000, 8.7% in 1999, and 8.6% in 1998.&nbsp; Passenger preference for
Saver awards, which have inventory controls, keep displacement of revenue
passengers at a minimum.&nbsp; Travel award seats flown on United represent
72% of the total awards issued, of which 87% are used for travel within
the U.S. and Canada.&nbsp; In addition to the awards issued for travel
on United, approximately 10% of the total awards issued are used for travel
on partner airlines.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Economy Plus<sup>&reg;</sup></u>.</b>&nbsp;
In late 1999, United announced Economy Plus, which is a reconfiguration
of the first six to eleven rows of the United Economy cabins on aircraft
serving the North America market.&nbsp; This reconfigured area provides
four to five additional inches of legroom for United' s Premier<sup>&reg;</sup>
frequent-flyers and full-fare United Economy customers, many of whom often
travel in the United Economy cabin.&nbsp; United was the first U.S. airline
to offer additional legroom on its North America flights and completed
the seat reconfiguration in early 2000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In early 2001, United announced
that it is reconfiguring its fleet of three-cabin international aircraft
to create Economy Plus seating.&nbsp; In doing so, United becomes the first
U.S. airline to offer premium seating area in the front of its economy
cabin on both its North America and international flights.&nbsp; United
also unveiled plans to enhance United Business class throughout its international
fleet to offer customers an additional seven inches of legroom.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Distribution Channels</u></b>.&nbsp;
The overwhelming majority of United' s airline inventory continues to be
distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and computer
reservation systems (CRS).&nbsp; United uses the Apollo reservation system,
which is hosted by Galileo International, a CRS in which United holds approximately
a 15% equity interest.&nbsp; The hosting agreement with Galileo continues
through 2004.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Electronic Commerce.</u></b>&nbsp;
Consumers are increasingly turning to online avenues to meet their travel
needs.&nbsp; United is using e-commerce capabilities to strengthen and
enhance its market position, attract new customer segments, and reduce
the overall costs of booking transportation.&nbsp; Additionally, United
is utilizing e-commerce capabilities in initiatives addressing opportunities
in the areas of cargo, process improvement and customer connectivity.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On October 3, 2000, UAL formed
United NewVentures, a new subsidiary to provide innovative solutions for
its customers, to strengthen United' s airline business and to create incremental
value for UAL Corporation' s stockholders.&nbsp; United NewVentures, Inc.
is a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United NewVentures currently
has two divisions, United NetVentures and United NetWorks.&nbsp; United
NetWorks incorporates the E-Commerce Division created in January, 2000.&nbsp;
The focus of United NetVentures is business development of non-United branded
businesses, enhancing United' s e-commerce partnerships and identifying
new e-commerce opportunities with strategic partners.&nbsp; United' s involvement
in projects such as Orbitz, Hotwire and Cordiem, a business-to-business
Internet exchange, are managed by United NetVentures.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United NetWorks is responsible
for all United-branded e-commerce activities, such as strategy, operations,
planning, and support of united.com, the airline' s web site, as well as
wireless initiatives, such as proactive customer notification of flight
information.&nbsp; United NetWorks is also responsible for the Mileage
Plus non-airline relationships, which currently include over ninety partners
among car rental, hotel, telecommunications, shopping, dining and financial
services companies.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Our United Commitment<sup>sm</sup></u></b>.&nbsp;
To renew its commitment to improve key areas of customer satisfaction and
as part of an industry-wide, voluntary initiative, United implemented a
comprehensive customer service plan, Our United Commitment, in late 1999
and fully deployed it in 2000.&nbsp; Our United Commitment addresses issues
identified by United' s frequent flyer customers as being most important
to them, such as improved communication, increased information throughout
the travel experience, more efficient baggage handling and greater responsiveness
to customer inquiries.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 13, 2001, the
Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation released its
full-year report on the effectiveness of the airline industry' s voluntary
initiatives.&nbsp; Although the report found that progress had been made
in some areas, it stressed that the industry continues to fall short in
notifying passengers about flight delays and cancellations.&nbsp; The report
is based on a review of the voluntary programs of 17 carriers, including
United.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past year, United
introduced new services aimed at helping customers avoid delays, keeping
customers informed when delays and cancellations occur, and minimizing
the impact of cancellations and delays upon customers.&nbsp; Examples of
such new services include:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>--Deploying an industry-leading proactive flight paging system;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>--Installing United EasyCheck-In<sup>sm</sup> kiosks, allowing customers
with E-tickets to bypass airport lines and check themselves in;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>--Deploying state-of-the-art mobile "chariot" workstations in all hub
airports, providing additional passenger check-in stations;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>--Installing the United EasyInfo<sup>sm</sup> digital electronic information
display systems, which give real-time information; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>--Launching the customer advocate center, which proactively accommodates
customers in anticipation of irregular operations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the report identified
where the airlines have been lacking, United received praise for measures
that went beyond actions required by Our United Commitment.&nbsp; The report
stated that initiatives such as more legroom between seats, expansion of
overhead baggage compartments and providing chariots to reduce lines were
additional efforts to make the travel experience better.&nbsp; Additionally,
United was one of only three airlines to incorporate its customer service
plan into its contract of carriage.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Industry Conditions</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Operating Environment</u><font color="#0000FF"><font size=-1>.</font></font></b>&nbsp;
The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.&nbsp; United'
s operations are often adversely impacted by winter weather and United'
s first- and fourth-quarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand.&nbsp;
Operating results for the Company are generally better in the second and
third quarters.&nbsp; In addition to weather conditions, air traffic control
limitations and concerted employee job actions may from time-to-time cause
disruptions in operations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Competition</u>.&nbsp;
</b>The airline industry is highly competitive.&nbsp; In domestic markets,
new and existing carriers are free to initiate service on any route.&nbsp;
United' s domestic competitors include all of the other major U.S. airlines
as well as regional carriers, some of which have lower cost structures
than United.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its international service,
United competes not only with U.S. carriers but also with foreign carriers,
including national flag carriers, which in certain instances enjoy forms
of governmental support not available to U.S. carriers.&nbsp; Competition
on certain international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental
regulations (see "Government Regulation").&nbsp; United has advantages
over foreign air carriers in the U.S. because of its ability to generate
U.S. origin-destination traffic from its integrated domestic route systems,
and because foreign carriers are prohibited by U.S. law from carrying local
passengers between two points in the U.S.&nbsp; United experiences comparable
restrictions in foreign countries.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, U.S. carriers
are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated
international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements
or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments.&nbsp; To compensate
for these structural limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered
into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow the carriers to provide
traffic feed to each other' s flights.&nbsp; (See "Marketing Strategy -
Alliances")
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Government Regulation</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>General</u>.&nbsp;
</b>All carriers engaged in air transportation in the U.S. are subject
to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT").&nbsp; The
DOT has authority to: issue certificates of public convenience and necessity
for domestic air transportation and, through the Federal Aviation Administration
("FAA"), air-carrier operating certificates; authorize the provision of
foreign air transportation by U.S. carriers; prohibit unjust discrimination;
prescribe forms of accounts and require reports from air carriers; regulate
methods of competition, including the provision and use of computerized
reservation systems; and administer regulations providing for consumer
protection, including regulations governing the accessibility of air transportation
facilities for handicapped individuals.&nbsp; United holds certificates
of public convenience and necessity, as well as air-carrier operating certificates,
and therefore is subject to DOT regulations.&nbsp; The FAA also administers
the U.S. air traffic control system and oversees aviation safety issues.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United' s operations require
licenses issued by the aviation authorities of the foreign countries that
United serves.&nbsp; Foreign aviation authorities may from time to time
impose a greater degree of economic regulation than exists with respect
to United' s North America operations.&nbsp; United' s ability to serve
some international markets and its expansion into many of these markets
are presently restricted by a lack of aviation agreements to allow such
service or, in some cases, by the restrictive terms of such agreements.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with its international
services, United is required to make regular filings with the DOT and to
observe tariffs establishing the fares charged and the rules governing
the transportation provided.&nbsp; In certain cases, fares and schedules
require the approval of the relevant foreign governments.&nbsp; Shifts
in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration
or termination of existing air service agreements between the U.S. and
other governments, and could diminish the value of United' s international
route authority.&nbsp; United' s operating rights under the air services
agreements might not be preserved in such cases.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Airport Access</u>.</b>&nbsp;
Historically, take-off and landing rights ("slots") at Chicago O' Hare
International, New York John F. Kennedy International, New York LaGuardia
and Washington Reagan National airports have been limited by the "high
density traffic rule."&nbsp; Under this rule, slots may be bought, sold
or traded.&nbsp; In April 2000, the U.S. President signed the Wendell H.
Ford Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century ("AIR 21") which includes
a phase-out of slots at Chicago' s O' Hare International Airport and New
York' s LaGuardia and JFK airports.&nbsp; Starting in May 2000, AIR 21
has allowed carriers to operate foreign air service at Chicago O' Hare
without slots, thereby eliminating the government' s need to withdraw slots
from incumbent carriers.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the phase-out
of the high density traffic rule, slot exemptions were made available for
new entrants, as well as for carriers providing service to small- to medium-sized
and non-hub airports.&nbsp; This exemption, however, led to a significant
increase of flights into and out of LaGuardia that far exceeded that airport'
s capacity.&nbsp; As a result, all carriers operating at LaGuardia, including
United, incurred a significant number of delays and cancellations during
2000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce the resulting traffic
congestion problems, the FAA implemented a slot lottery system for determining
the additional carriers that may operate from LaGuardia.&nbsp; The lottery
system is currently in effect and has substantially reduced delays and
cancellations.&nbsp; The slot lottery was designed as a temporary remedy;
the FAA is currently considering a number of capacity management alternatives
at LaGuardia for long-term improvement, including making slot lotteries
permanent.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AIR 21 also provides that
nearly $40 billion from the U.S. Aviation Trust Fund is to be invested
in aviation facilities, equipment and training, examples of which could
be radar modernization, airport construction projects, and the hiring and
training of air traffic controllers.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the Atlantic, the
Commission of the European Union ("EU") has proposed a regulation that
would, if enacted, dramatically alter the manner in which airport slots
are held and allocated.&nbsp; The centerpiece of the proposal is that a
slot at major airports would have a life-span of only ten years, at which
time it would automatically revert to the airport slot controller.&nbsp;
The proposal has been met with fierce opposition from airlines.&nbsp; The
Commission will likely re-evaluate its original proposal and consider a
milder form of slot reform.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United currently has a sufficient
number of leased gates and other airport facilities, but expansion by United
may be constrained at certain airports by insufficient availability of
gates on attractive terms or other factors, such as noise restrictions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Safety</u>.</b>&nbsp;
The FAA has regulatory jurisdiction over flight operations generally, including
equipment, ground facilities, maintenance, communications and other matters.&nbsp;
United' s aircraft and engines are maintained in accordance with the standards
and procedures recommended and approved by the manufacturers and the FAA.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, the FAA
issues airworthiness directives ("ADs") which require air carriers to undertake
inspections and to make unscheduled modifications and improvements on aircraft,
engines and related components and parts.&nbsp; The ADs sometimes cause
United to incur substantial, unplanned expense when aircraft or engines
are removed from service prematurely in order to undergo mandated inspections
or modifications.&nbsp; The issuance of any particular AD may have a greater
or lesser impact on United, compared to its competitors, depending upon
the equipment covered by the directive.&nbsp; Civil and criminal sanctions
may be assessed for not complying with the ADs.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Air Transport Association
("ATA"), an industry organization to which United belongs, and the Department
of Defense ("DoD") have signed a memorandum of understanding, establishing
procedures for auditing international code-share partners that carry DoD
personnel.&nbsp; Based on the DOT/FAA Safety Program Guidelines issued
to all U.S. carriers, United has also established a safety review plan
for Star Alliance and code-share airlines.&nbsp; Audits are conducted on
both prospective and existing code-share partners.&nbsp; The FAA reviews
audit reports and makes code-share approval recommendations to the DOT.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Passenger Rights Legislation</u>.</b>&nbsp;
Following the February 2001 report of the DOT Inspector General, several
pieces of legislation were introduced by members of the U.S. Congress to
implement a variety of changes in the airline industry, such as: requiring
airlines to disclose all available fares; allowing consumers to purchase
any published fare from an airline or a travel agent; requiring airlines
to disclose the number of seats available for frequent flyer travelers;
and granting authority to the DOT to intervene and roll back fares in certain
markets.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2000, the EU' s transport
commissioner proposed two legislative alternatives for limiting airlines'&nbsp;
use of overbooking as a revenue management device.&nbsp; The first alternative
would distinguish between an intention to fly and a confirmed booking.&nbsp;
If the passenger has only indicated an intention to fly, the passenger
would be allowed to cancel without penalty and the airline would be allowed
to give away the seat.&nbsp; For a confirmed booking, however, an airline
would have no choice but to provide a seat for a passenger with a confirmed
booking.&nbsp; The second alternative under consideration is to limit an
airline' s ability to overbook.&nbsp; The limitation would be combined
with efforts to encourage airlines to stage auctions where the carrier
improves its compensation offer until someone is tempted to surrender his
or her seat.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not clear what form
that any of the U.S. or European legislation might ultimately take.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Privacy Laws</u>.</b>&nbsp;
An initiative of significant impact within the EU and elsewhere is the
introduction of privacy standards that apply to companies transmitting
private information from the EU to countries abroad.&nbsp; To comply with
the privacy directives, the U.S. Commerce Department and the EU Commission
have agreed to safe harbor principles.&nbsp; Although the safe harbor principles
are voluntary at this point, United plans to comply with them.&nbsp; In
mid-2001, the U.S. Commerce Department and the EU Commission will review
the status of voluntary compliance.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada, Argentina and Australia
have enacted new privacy laws covering the collection and disclosure of
personally identifiable information.&nbsp; These laws have either gone
into force or will go into force later this year, and may have an impact
on the way United collects and transmits personal identifiable information
in these jurisdictions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Environmental Regulations</u>.</b>&nbsp;
United operates a number of underground and above-ground storage tanks
throughout its system.&nbsp; They are used for the storage of fuels and
deicing fluids.&nbsp; United has been identified as a Potentially Responsible
Party in some state and federal recovery actions involving soil and ground
water contamination.&nbsp; The Company has been working with the relevant
government agencies to resolve the issues and believes they will be resolved
without material adverse effect on the Company.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Employees - Labor Matters</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000, the
Company and its subsidiaries had more than 102,000 employees.&nbsp; Approximately
80 % of United' s employees are represented by various labor organizations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collective bargaining agreements
are negotiated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations
in the transportation industry, and typically do not contain an expiration
date.&nbsp; Instead, they specify a date called the amendable date, by
which either party may notify the other of its desire to amend the agreement.&nbsp;
Upon reaching the amendable date, the contract is considered "open for
amendment."&nbsp; Prior to the amendable date, neither party is required
to agree to modifications to the bargaining agreement.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
nothing prevents the parties from agreeing to start negotiations or to
modify the agreement in advance of the amendable date.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contracts remain in effect
while new agreements are negotiated.&nbsp; During the negotiating period,
both the Company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the
status quo.&nbsp; Recent operating disruptions suggest, however, that some
members of the negotiating employee group may engage in activities designed
to "slow down" the airline.&nbsp; These slowdown tactics may involve refusal
to work overtime, increased sick leave usage and other disruptive behavior
that could have an adverse impact on operations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United' s collective bargaining
agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers ("IAM") became amendable on July 12, 2000.&nbsp; United is currently
in negotiations with the IAM, under the auspices of the National Mediation
Board ("NMB").&nbsp; Under the law, the parties are not allowed to resort
to self-help, such as strikes or lock-outs, until they are released from
mediation by the NMB, and then only after a 30 day cooling-off period.&nbsp;
However, the NMB can request the U.S. president to create a Presidential
Emergency Board, the creation of which imposes an additional 60-day bar
against self-help remedies.&nbsp; If the parties fail to reach a resolution
by the end of the 60 days, the U.S. Congress can impose a settlement.&nbsp;
The Company cannot predict when the current negotiations will be resolved.&nbsp;
For additional information on the status of negotiations, see "Labor Agreements"
in <u>Item 7. Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations</u>.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The employee groups, number

<p><b><u>Corporate Governance and the ESOPs</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Background.</b>&nbsp;
In July 1994, the stockholders of UAL approved a plan of recapitalization
that provided an approximately 55% equity and voting interest in UAL to
certain employees of United, in exchange for wage concessions and work-rule
changes.&nbsp; The employees'&nbsp; equity interest was allocated to individual
employee accounts through the year 2000 under the Employee Stock Ownership
Plans ("ESOPs") created as part of the recapitalization.&nbsp; The entire
ESOP voting interest is voted by the ESOP trustee at the direction of,
and on behalf of, the employees participating in the ESOPs.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the recapitalization,
the Company' s stockholders approved an elaborate governance structure,
which is contained principally in the Company' s Restated Certificate of
Incorporation ("UAL Charter") and the ESOPs.&nbsp; Among other matters,
the UAL Charter provides that the Company' s Board of Directors is to consist
of five public directors, four independent directors, and three employee
directors which are appointed by different classes of stockholders (see
the Company' s Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders for
information concerning the processes for electing the directors and for
Board committee requirements).&nbsp; A number of special stockholder and
Board voting requirements were also established, as summarized below.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Special Voting.</b>&nbsp;
In specified circumstances ("Extraordinary Matters"), actions by UAL or
United Airlines require approval of either (a) 75% of the entire Board,
including at least one union director, or (b) 75% of the voting stock present
at a stockholder meeting.&nbsp; "Extraordinary Matters" include certain
business transactions outside the ordinary course of business, significant
asset dispositions, and most issuances of equity securities.&nbsp; Most
issuances of equity securities are also subject to a first refusal agreement
in favor of employees participating in the ESOPs.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other special voting requirements
apply to amendments to the UAL Charter and certain bylaws, repurchases
of common stock, stock sales to employee benefit plans, and business transactions
with labor. The special voting rights referred to in the previous paragraph
will continue until "Sunset" (defined below), at which time the corporate
governance section will convert to a more traditional form, providing for
nine public directors and three employee directors.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of a merger or
Control Transaction (defined below) that involves an Uninstructed Trustee
Action (defined below), any required stockholder approval must also include
at least a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares
of the Director Preferred Stocks (defined below), UAL common stock and
such other classes and series of stock that vote together with the common
stock as a single class ("Single Class Voting").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sunset.</b>"&nbsp; The
Voting Preferred Stock (see Item 8, Note 13 of the <u>Notes to Consolidated
Financial<font color="#0000FF"> </font>Statements</u>) outstanding at any
time commands voting power for approximately 55% of the vote of all classes
of capital stock in all matters requiring a stockholder vote, other than
the election of members of the Board of Directors.&nbsp; The Voting Preferred
Stock will generally continue to represent approximately 55% of the aggregate
voting power until Sunset, even though the common stock issuable upon conversion
of the ESOP stock may represent more or less than 55% of the fully diluted
common stock of UAL.&nbsp; Sunset will occur when the common shares issuable
upon conversion of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP convertible preferred stock
(see Item 8, Note 13 of the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial<font color="#0000FF">
</font>Statements</u>), plus any common equity (generally common stock
issued or issuable at the time of the recapitalization) held by any other
Company sponsored employee benefit plans, plus any available unissued ESOP
shares held in the ESOPs equal, in the aggregate, less than 20% of the
common equity and available unissued ESOP shares of UAL.&nbsp; For purposes
of measuring the Sunset, employee ownership was approximately 63.84% at
December 31, 2000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Transactions.</b>&nbsp;
A "Control Transaction" is a tender or exchange offer, or other opportunity
to dispose of or convert at least 3% of UAL common stock, Class 1 and Class
2 ESOP convertible preferred stock into common stock, and Voting Preferred
Stocks, or any transaction or series of related transactions in which any
person or group acquires or seeks to acquire control of UAL or of all or
substantially all of the assets of UAL and its subsidiaries.&nbsp; In a
Control Transaction, ESOP participants are entitled to instruct the ESOP
trustee as to whether to tender, sell, convert or otherwise dispose of
shares allocated to their accounts under the ESOP, and current employees
who are ESOP participants may give the same instructions for ESOP shares
that have been issued, but not yet allocated to participants.&nbsp; Shares
held by the Supplemental ESOP will be tendered or directed by the Supplemental
ESOP Committee.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a Control Transaction
results in the sale or exchange of any shares held by the ESOPs, the proceeds
will be used to acquire, to the extent possible, shares of common stock
(or preferred stock which is convertible into common) that qualify as "employer
securities" as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 409(l).&nbsp; If
UAL shares do not qualify as "employer securities," then the shares must
be "employer securities" of a public company having a Moody' s senior long-term
debt rating at least as good as that of UAL and United at such time.&nbsp;
If such securities cannot be acquired, then UAL, ALPA and the IAM will
make appropriate arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the unions to
protect the interests of the participants.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstructed Trustee Actions.</b>&nbsp;
An uninstructed trustee action refers to situations in which the ESOP trustee
adopts a course of action without obtaining instructions from the ESOP
participants, or disregards their instructions, including situations involving
Control Transactions.&nbsp; Under specific circumstances, this action can
cause the Voting Preferred Stocks to be converted into UAL common stock,
with the special voting rights of these shares transferring to the Director
Preferred Stocks (defined as Class Pilot MEC, IAM, and SAM junior preferred
stock -- see Item 8, Note 13 of the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial<font color="#0000FF">
</font>Statements</u>) in the following approximate percentages: to the
holder of the Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock, 46.23%; to the holder of
the Class IAM Preferred Stock, 37.13% ; and to the holders of the Class
SAM Preferred Stock, 16.64%.&nbsp; The Director Preferred Stocks will continue
to hold the Single Class Voting Rights until Sunset, or if Sunset occurs
because of, or within one year of, an uninstructed trustee action, July
12, 2010.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific
circumstances that give rise to a transfer of voting rights include:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; The ESOP trustee fails to solicit timely instructions or
fails to act in accordance with such instructions (see below for reasons),
with respect to the following:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the transfer of voting rights, a stockholders vote
would have been sufficient to approve a merger or Control Transaction involving
UAL or United, or if no vote is required, the ESOP trustee enters into
a binding commitment in connection with a Control Transaction; or
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; the ESOP trustee disposes of 10% or more of the common
equity represented by the Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock (other
than in connection with the usual distribution or diversification under
the ESOP).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition, one of the following circumstances must be present:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; such transaction would not have been approved if the trustee
had solicited and/or followed the instructions;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; no timely solicitation of instructions occurs, and the
matter would not have been approved had the ESOP trustee cast all its votes
against the matter, or
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; a matter that does not require a stockholder vote to approve
such transaction.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ESOP trustee' s disregard
of instructions gives rise to an uninstructed trustee action only when
the failure to follow the instructions is attributable to (1) the trustee'
s conclusion that its fiduciary responsibilities require the trustee to
not follow the instructions or (2) the ESOP provisions relating to soliciting
are unenforceable.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has entered into various
leases relating to its use of airport-landing areas, gates, hangar sites,
terminal buildings and other airport facilities in most of the municipalities
it serves.&nbsp; Major leases expire at Chicago O' Hare in 2018, Los Angeles
in 2021, San Francisco in 2011, and Washington Dulles in 2014.&nbsp; United
also has leased ticketing, sales and general office space in the downtown
and outlying areas of most of the larger cities in its system.&nbsp; In
suburban Chicago, United owns a 106-acre complex consisting of more than
one million square feet of office space for its world headquarters, a computer
facility and a training center.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United' s Maintenance Operation
Center ("MOC") at San Francisco International Airport occupies 129 acres
of land, three-million square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar
docks under a lease expiring in 2003, with an option to extend for 10 years.&nbsp;
United' s Indianapolis Maintenance Center, a major aircraft maintenance
and overhaul facility, is operated under a lease with the Indianapolis
Airport Authority that expires in 2031.&nbsp; United also has a major facility
at the Oakland, California airport, dedicated to widebody airframe maintenance.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Denver International Airport,
United operates under a lease and use agreement expiring in 2025, and occupies
52 gates and more than one million square feet of exclusive or preferential
use terminal building space.&nbsp; United' s flight training center, located
in the City and County of Denver, can accommodate 36 flight simulators
and more than 90 computer-based training stations.

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Frank, et al. v. United; EEOC v.
United</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As previously reported in
our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000, a class action
lawsuit against United was filed February 7, 1992 in federal district court
in California, alleging that United' s former flight attendant weight program,
in effect from 1989 to 1994, unlawfully discriminated against flight attendants
on the grounds of sex, age and other factors, and seeking monetary relief.&nbsp;
On April 29, 1994, the class was certified as to the sex and age claims.&nbsp;
Following extensive motion practice, on March 10, 1998, the district court
dismissed all the claims against United.&nbsp; Following an appeal to the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a three judge panel of the Ninth
Circuit, on June 21, 2000, overturned the ruling and held that United'
s former weight program violated the law.&nbsp; The court ruled that the
plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their claims
for discrimination based on sex and that a trial was required for determination
on their claims for age discrimination.&nbsp; In addition, the appellate
court reversed the dismissal of all individual class representative claims
of discrimination and the case was remanded to the district court for further
proceedings.&nbsp; United' s petition for en banc review by an 11-judge
panel was denied on August 11, 2000.&nbsp; On December 8, 2000, United
petitioned for a review of the Ninth Circuit decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court, but that petition was denied on March 5, 2001.&nbsp; In accordance
with the appellate court ruling, the case will go back to the district
court for further proceedings with respect to the age discrimination claims
and for a determination of damages with respect to the sex discrimination
claims.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As previously reported in
our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000, United sued Mesa
Airlines, Inc. and its subsidiary, WestAir Commuter Airlines, Inc., on
June 23, 1997, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois, seeking an order declaring that United had the right to make
certain market adjustments in markets served by WestAir' s United Express
service in California.&nbsp; On January 22, 1998, United notified Mesa
that it was terminating Mesa' s United Express contract and United amended
its complaint to add claims against Mesa for failure to fly and for monetary
damages.&nbsp; Mesa and WestAir filed claims against United alleging, among
other things, wrongful termination of their contract and fraud, and seeking
monetary damages.&nbsp; On July 5, 2000, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the dismissal of Mesa' s tort claims, including its claim alleging
fraud on the ground that those claims are preempted by the Airline Deregulation
Act.&nbsp; Mesa filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court.&nbsp;
That petition was denied, ending the appeals process for the tort claims.&nbsp;
On March 5, 2001, the parties agreed to a settlement and have since dismissed
the remaining claims.

<p><b><i>US Airways Acquisition</i></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 24, 2000, UAL announced
that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with US Airways
Group, Inc. ("US Airways") pursuant to which US Airways will be acquired
by the Company in an all-cash transaction for $4.3 billion.&nbsp; Additionally,
UAL will assume approximately $1.7 billion in US Airways net debt and $6.3
billion in operating leases.&nbsp; On October 12, 2000, the stockholders
of US Airways approved the merger.&nbsp; The transaction, which the Company
anticipates closing in the second quarter of 2001, is still subject to
regulatory clearance and other customary closing conditions.&nbsp; Definitive
financing arrangements have not yet been determined although UAL expects
to incur approximately $4.5 billion in additional indebtedness, through
a combination of bank and public financing, to cover the cost of the acquisition
as well as additional costs related to the integration of the airlines.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to regulatory approval
of the transaction and the successful outcome of negotiations with local
authorities, the Company announced its intentions to expand US Airways'&nbsp;
maintenance facility in Pittsburgh at a total projected cost of $160 million.&nbsp;
Additionally, the Company recognizes that it will incur significant costs
associated with the integration of US Airways in order to achieve the anticipated
benefits to both the Company and the millions of passengers and hundreds
of communities served by United throughout the United States.&nbsp; The
Company expects that the new network will make traveling more convenient
for passengers, connecting US Airways'&nbsp; eastern U.S. markets with
United' s east-west and international markets, thereby creating the nation'
s most comprehensive airline network.&nbsp; However, the Company recognizes
that it may encounter difficulties in achieving these significant benefits.&nbsp;
As part of the agreement with US Airways, UAL generally has agreed to pay
US Airways a $50 million termination fee in the event the merger does not
take place.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, UAL and US Airways
entered into a binding memorandum of understanding with Robert Johnson,
a member of the US Airways Group Board of Directors, under which Mr. Johnson
would buy certain of US Airways'&nbsp; assets and create a new airline,
to be called DC Air, which would compete on numerous routes currently served
by US Airways in the Washington D.C. area.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a transaction designed
to enhance the competitive benefits of the proposed merger with US Airways
and address regulatory concerns, UAL and AMR Corporation ("AMR") on January
9, 2001 announced the approval of a binding memorandum of understanding,
under which AMR' s American Airlines subsidiary ("American") will provide
competitive service on key hub-to-hub routes where United and US Airways
currently are the only competitors with non-stop flights.&nbsp; As part
of the agreement, American will also enter into a 20-year joint venture
with United to jointly provide service on routes currently served by the
US Airways Shuttle between New York' s LaGuardia Airport, Washington, D.C.'
s Reagan National Airport and Boston' s Logan Airport.&nbsp; In addition,
United will transfer a number of gates, slots and up to 86 aircraft acquired
in its merger with US Airways to American deemed to be surplus to the combined
United and US Airways entity.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AMR will pay UAL up to $1.2
billion in cash for this transaction.&nbsp; In addition, American will
assume certain lease obligations and buy certain spare engines and other
parts associated with the aircraft being transferred.&nbsp; The transaction
will provide financial benefits to UAL by reducing the debt requirements
related to the acquisition of US Airways.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 2, 2001, UAL announced
that it had reached agreement with Atlantic Coast Airlines Holdings, Inc.
("ACAI"), for US Airways to sell its three wholly owned regional airlines
to ACAI for an initial purchase price of $200 million.&nbsp; UAL and ACAI
will seek to agree upon the ultimate purchase price over an 18-month period.&nbsp;
If an ultimate purchase price is not agreed as to a carrier, then the transaction
as to that carrier is subject to being unwound.&nbsp; If ACAI is not the
ultimate purchaser of at least one of the carriers, they will receive a
fee of up to $10 million.&nbsp; The transaction, which is contingent upon
and will occur at the same time as closing of the proposed acquisition
of US Airways, is subject to regulatory approvals and to certain termination
rights by UAL.&nbsp; In addition, at closing, the three carriers (Allegheny
Airlines, Piedmont Airlines and PSA Airlines) are expected to execute agreements
to provide feeder service to the combined United and US Airways network.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Results of Operations</i></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, the Company
experienced significant operational disruptions, as a result of labor-related
delays and cancellations, as well as weather and air traffic control limitations,
which adversely affected both revenue and expense performance.&nbsp; The
Company attempted to mitigate the impact of these operational difficulties
by reducing capacity, particularly in the domestic markets, where most
of the problems were concentrated. The Company estimates the revenue shortfall
arising from these disruptions and associated schedule reductions and cancellations
to be somewhere between $700 and $750 million for the year.
<p><b>Summary of Results -</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL' s earnings from operations
were $654 million in 2000, compared to operating earnings of $1.4 billion
in 1999.&nbsp; UAL' s net earnings in 2000 were $50 million ($0.04 per
share, diluted), compared to net earnings of $1.2 billion in 1999 ($9.94
per share, diluted).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2000 earnings include
an extraordinary loss of $6 million, after tax, on early extinguishment
of debt and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of
$209 million, net of tax.&nbsp; The 2000 earnings also include an impairment
loss of $38 million, net of tax ($0.33 per share, diluted), related to
the Company' s equity investment in Priceline.com, as well as a gain of
$69 million, net of tax ($0.60 per share, diluted), on the sale of its
investment in GetThere.com (see Note 6 "Investments" in the <u>Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements</u>).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1999 earnings include
an extraordinary loss of $3 million, after tax, on early extinguishment
of debt and an after-tax gain of $468 million ($4.19 per share, diluted),
on the sale of certain of the Company' s investments, as further described
in Note 6 "Investments" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>2000 Compared with 1999 -</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Operating Revenues.&nbsp;
</i></b>Operating revenues increased $1.3 billion (7%) and United' s revenue
per available seat mile (unit revenue) increased 8% to 11.02 cents.&nbsp;
Passenger revenues increased $1.1 billion (7%) primarily due to a 6% increase
in yield to 13.25 cents.&nbsp; United' s revenue passenger miles increased
1%, while available seat miles decreased 1%, resulting in a passenger load
factor increase of 1.3 points to 72.3%.&nbsp; The decrease in available
seat miles reflects the Company' s response to the operational difficulties
as well as the impact of Economy Plus.&nbsp; The following analysis by
market is based on information reported to the DOT:

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cargo revenues increased
$25 million (3%) on increased freight ton miles of 3%, as freight yields
remained constant and mail yields increased 1%.&nbsp; Other operating revenues
increased $152 million (19%) primarily due to increased fuel sales to third
parties and additional revenues from operating agreements with Galileo
International, Inc. ("Galileo"), offset by the decrease in other revenues
related to the change in accounting for Mileage Plus sale of miles to third
parties (see Note 1i "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Mileage
Plus Awards" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>).
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating Expenses.</i></b>&nbsp;
Operating expenses increased $2.1 billion (12%) and United' s cost per
available seat mile increased 13% from 9.41 to 10.63 cents.&nbsp; Salaries
and related costs increased $1.1 billion (19%) due to a new salary program
implemented for non-contract employees, the impact of the new ALPA contract,
and the estimated costs of IAM contracts which became amendable in July
2000 and are currently under negotiation.&nbsp; ESOP compensation expense
decreased $609 million (81%) as the Company discontinued recording ESOP
compensation expense once the final ESOP shares were committed to be released
in April 2000.&nbsp; Aircraft fuel increased $735 million (41%) due to
a 40% increase in the cost of fuel to 81.0 cents per gallon.&nbsp; Commissions
decreased $114 million (10%) due to a change in the commission structure
implemented in the fourth quarter of 1999.&nbsp; Purchased services increased
$136 million (9%) due to increases in computer reservations fees and credit
card discount fees.&nbsp; Depreciation and amortization increased $138
million (16%) due to an increase in the number of owned aircraft and losses
on disposition of aircraft and other equipment.&nbsp; Cost of sales increased
$436 million (72%) primarily due to costs associated with fuel sales to
third parties.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Other Income and Expense</i>.&nbsp;
</b>Other income (expense) amounted to $223 million in expense in 2000
compared to $551 million in income in 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interest expense
increased $40 million (11%) due to increased debt issuances in 2000.&nbsp;
Interest income increased $33 million (49%) due to higher investment balances.&nbsp;
In addition, 2000 included a $109 million gain on the sale of GetThere.com
stock and a $61 million investment impairment related to warrants held
in Priceline.com, while 1999 included a $669 million gain on the sale of
Galileo stock and a $62 million gain on the sale of Equant N.V. ("Equant")
stock.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>1999 Compared with 1998 -</b>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Operating Revenues.</b></i>&nbsp;
Operating revenues increased $466 million (3%) and United' s revenue per
available seat mile (unit revenue) increased 1% to 10.17 cents.&nbsp; Passenger
revenues increased $264 million (2%) due to a 1% increase in United' s
revenue passenger miles and a 1% increase in yield to 12.48 cents.&nbsp;
Available seat miles across the system were up 2% year over year; however,
passenger load factor decreased 0.6 points to 71.0% as traffic only increased
1% system-wide.&nbsp; The following analysis by market is based on information

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cargo revenues decreased
$7 million (1%) despite increased freight ton miles of 5%, as a 4% decline
in freight yield combined with a 3% decline in mail yield.&nbsp; Other
operating revenues increased $209 million (19%) due to increases in frequent
flyer program partner related revenues and fuel sales to third parties.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Operating Expenses.</i></b>&nbsp;
Operating expenses increased $553 million (3%) and United' s cost per available
seat mile increased 2% from 9.24 to 9.41 cents.&nbsp; ESOP compensation
expense decreased $73 million (9%), reflecting the decrease in the estimated
average fair value of ESOP stock committed to be released to employees
as a result of UAL' s lower common stock price.&nbsp; Salaries and related
costs increased $329 million (6%) as a result of increased staffing in
customer-contact positions, as well as salary increases for most labor
groups which took effect July 1, 1998.&nbsp; Commissions decreased $186
million (14%) due to a change in the commission structure implemented in
the third quarter 1998 as well as a slight decrease in commissionable revenues.&nbsp;
In addition, in October 1999, the Company reduced the base commissions
for tickets purchased in the U.S. and Canada to 5%, subject to roundtrip
caps of $50 and $100 for domestic and international tickets, respectively.&nbsp;
Purchased services increased $70 million (5%) due to increases in computer
reservations fees and year 2000-related expenses.&nbsp; Depreciation and
amortization increased $74 million (9%) due to an increase in the number
of owned aircraft and losses on disposition of aircraft partially offset
by changes in depreciable lives of certain aircraft.&nbsp; In addition,
United wrote-down two non-operating B747-200 aircraft to net realizable
value.&nbsp; Cost of sales increased $128 million (27%) primarily due to
costs associated with fuel sales to third parties.&nbsp; Aircraft maintenance
increased $65 million (10%) due to an increase in heavy maintenance visits.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Other Income and Expense.</i></b>&nbsp;
Other income (expense) amounted to $551 million in income in 1999 compared
to $222 million in expense in 1998.&nbsp; Interest capitalized, primarily
on aircraft advance payments, decreased $30 million (29%).&nbsp; Interest
income increased $9 million (15%) due to higher investment balances.&nbsp;
In addition, 1999 included a $669 million gain on the sale of Galileo stock
and a $62 million gain on the sale of Equant stock.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Liquidity and Capital Resources</i></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Liquidity -</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL' s total of cash and
cash equivalents and short-term investments was $2.3 billion at December
31, 2000, compared to $689 million at December 31, 1999.&nbsp; Operating
activities during the year generated $2.5 billion.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Property additions, including
aircraft, aircraft spare parts, facilities and ground equipment, amounted
to $2.5 billion, while property dispositions resulted in proceeds of $324
million.&nbsp; In 2000, United took delivery of four A319, twelve A320,
one B747, three B767 and eight B777 aircraft.&nbsp; Twenty-six of these
aircraft were purchased and two were acquired under capital leases.&nbsp;
Five of the aircraft purchased during the year were later sold and then
leased back under capital leases.&nbsp; In addition, United retired three
DC10-10, four DC10-30F and seven B747 aircraft.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, the Company
made payments of $81 million for the repurchase of 1.3 million shares of
common stock.&nbsp; Financing activities included the issuance of $2.4
billion in equipment trust certificates, as well as principal payments
under debt and capital lease obligations of $441 million and $283 million,
respectively.&nbsp; Included in the debt payments was the retirement of
$116 million of long-term debt prior to maturity.&nbsp; Additionally, UAL
issued, and subsequently retired, $200 million in long-term debt during
the period to finance the acquisition of aircraft.&nbsp; UAL may also from
time to time repurchase on the open market, in privately negotiated purchases
or otherwise, its debt and equity securities.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Included in cash and cash
equivalents at December 31, 2000 were $39 million of securities held by
third parties under securities lending agreements, as well as collateral
in the amount of 102% of the value of the securities lent.&nbsp; United
is obligated to reacquire the securities at the end of the contract.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of December 31, 2000,
UAL had a working capital deficit of $2.0 billion as compared to $2.5 billion
at December 31, 1999.&nbsp; Historically, UAL has operated with a working
capital deficit and, as in the past, UAL expects to meet all of its obligations
as they become due.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Prior Years.</i></b>&nbsp;
Operating activities in 1999 generated cash flows of $2.4 billion and the
Company' s sale of part of its investments in Galileo and Equant provided
$828 million in cash.&nbsp; Cash was used primarily to fund net additions
to property and equipment ($2.2 billion) and to repurchase common stock
($261 million).&nbsp; Financing activities also included principal payments
under debt and capital lease obligations of $513 million and $248 million,
respectively.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating activities in 1998
generated cash flows of $3.2 billion.&nbsp; Cash was used primarily to
fund net additions to property and equipment ($2.4 billion) and to repurchase
common stock ($459 million).&nbsp; Financing activities also included repayments
of long-term debt totaling $271 million and payments under capital leases
of $322 million, as well as aircraft lease deposits of $154 million.&nbsp;
Additionally, the Company issued $928 million in debt and used part of
the proceeds to purchase $693 million in equipment certificates under Company
operating leases.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Capital Commitments -</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000, commitments
for the purchase of property and equipment, principally aircraft, approximated
$4.7 billion, after deducting advance payments.&nbsp; Of this amount, an
estimated $2.5 billion is due to be spent in 2001.&nbsp; For further details,
see Note 18 "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties" in
the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Capital Resources -</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funds necessary to finance
aircraft acquisitions are expected to be obtained from internally generated
funds, external financing arrangements or other external sources.&nbsp;
Additionally, during 2001, UAL anticipates requiring additional financing
for its planned acquisition of US Airways.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000, UAL
and United had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to offer up to $2.5 billion of securities,
including secured and unsecured debt, equipment trust and pass through
certificates or a combination thereof.&nbsp; United also has available
approximately $1.7 billion in short-term revolving credit facilities, as
well as a separate $227 million short-term borrowing facility, as described
in Note 8 "Short-Term Borrowings" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements</u>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000, United'
s senior unsecured debt was rated BB+ by Standard and Poor' s ("S&amp;P")
and Baa3 by Moody' s Investors Service Inc. ("Moody' s").&nbsp; UAL' s
Series B preferred stock and redeemable preferred securities were rated
B+ by S&amp;P and Ba3 by Moody' s.&nbsp; Immediately following UAL' s announcement
of the planned acquisition of US Airways, S&amp;P placed UAL and United
securities on CreditWatch with negative implications.

<p><b><i>Other Information</i></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">Labor Agreements -</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 12, 2000, the Company'
s contract with ALPA became amendable and in October 2000, the parties
signed a new contract.&nbsp; The agreement, which will become amendable
September 1, 2004, includes provisions for an immediate increase in wages
of 21.5% to 28.7%, retroactive to April 12, as well as additional annual
increases of 4.5% to 5.6% for the duration of the contract.&nbsp; Additionally,
the contract allows United Express carriers to increase the number of small
jets beyond the current 65-jet limit up to an additional 150 immediately
as replacements for existing turboprops, with additional increases in small
jets as United' s fleet grows.&nbsp; United may also share in profits and
losses of revenues with foreign carriers with whom United has antitrust
immunity, provided United gets its proportionate share of the flying.&nbsp;
In addition, the Company has reached agreement with ALPA to provide United
pilots with protections that are realistically representative of their
pre-merger expectations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 12, 2000, the Company'
s contracts with the IAM became amendable.&nbsp; The Company has been in
negotiations with the IAM since January 2000 for new contracts.&nbsp; Since
September 2000, the negotiations have been conducted with the assistance
of the National Mediation Board.&nbsp; Under the terms of the Railway Labor
Act, United' s current agreements with the IAM will remain in effect while
negotiations continue.&nbsp; The Company has agreed that wage increases
under the new IAM contracts will be retroactive to July 12, 2000 and the
estimated costs of those contracts have been included in the Company' s
results for 2000.&nbsp; The Company and the IAM had also initialed an agreement
on December 12, 2000 that would have provided for job protection benefits
to most mechanics, including relocation protection in the case of displacement
due to the merger transaction.&nbsp; The IAM has recently notified the
Company that they consider that agreement to be rescinded.&nbsp; Talks
are ongoing and United hopes to reach agreement with the IAM on these issues.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company' s contract with
the AFA, which becomes amendable in 2006, provides for a mid-term wage
conference in the first quarter of 2001.&nbsp; However, in September 2000,
United and the AFA began wage discussions unrelated to the contract that
would have avoided the need for this wage conference.&nbsp; The parties
also began addressing integration issues related to United' s acquisition
of US Airways at this time.&nbsp; The Company and the AFA have not reached
agreement on these issues to date and the Company began wage conference
negotiations per the contract in February 2001.&nbsp; The Company is continuing
to seek to resolve all outstanding issues with the AFA, although arbitration
may be required per the collective bargaining agreement, if an agreement
cannot be reached on wages.&nbsp; It is the Company' s desire through these
discussions to avoid any AFA operational action that would significantly
inconvenience its customers or disrupt schedules.&nbsp; However, should
such action occur, the Company will take appropriate steps to minimize
the impact to the Company and its customers.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>E-Commerce -</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October 2000, UAL announced
the formation of United NewVentures, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary which
will create businesses to provide innovative solutions for its customers,
strengthen United' s airline business and create incremental value for
UAL' s stockholders.&nbsp; The subsidiary employs about 100 people, primarily
from the Company' s former e-commerce organization and consists of two
divisions, United NetWorks and United NetVentures.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United NetWorks focuses on
expanding United-branded e-commerce and wireless activities, including
the recently redesigned united.com web site, as well as assuming responsibility
for marketing the sale of Mileage Plus miles to third parties.&nbsp; Gross
air bookings on united.com in 2000 grew more than 101% over last year.&nbsp;
Total passenger revenue from sales over the Internet reached $755 million
for the year compared to $400 million for 1999, an 89% increase.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United NetVentures will manage
United' s investments in other Internet ventures, including two new multi-airline
travel-oriented web sites, Orbitz and Hotwire, and identify new business
opportunities in e-commerce.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Foreign Operations -</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United generates revenues
and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies.&nbsp; These expenses
include aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel expense, advertising
and distribution costs, customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance.&nbsp;
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact operating income through
changes in foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses.&nbsp;
Despite the adverse (favorable) effects a strengthening (weakening) foreign
currency may have on U.S. originating traffic, a strengthening (weakening)
of foreign currencies tends to increase (decrease) reported revenue and
operating income because United' s foreign currency-denominated operating
revenue generally exceeds its foreign currency-denominated operating expense
for each currency.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a worldwide network
and significant sales and marketing efforts in the U.S. as well as every
major economic region in the world, United is able to mitigate its exposure
to fluctuations in any single foreign currency.&nbsp; The Company' s biggest
net exposures are typically for Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollars, Australian
dollars, British pounds and the euro.&nbsp; During 2000, yen-denominated
operating revenue net of yen-denominated operating expense was approximately
21 billion yen (approximately $195 million), Hong Kong dollar-denominated
operating revenue net of Hong Kong dollar-denominated operating expense
was approximately 1,397 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately $179 million),
British pound-denominated operating revenue net of British pound-denominated
operating expense was approximately 97 million British pounds (approximately
$142 million), Australian dollar-denominated operating revenue net of Australian
dollar-denominated operating expense was approximately 154 million Australian
dollars (approximately $90 million), and euro-denominated operating revenue
net of euro-denominated operating expense was approximately 34 million
euro (approximately $33 million).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce the impact of exchange
rate fluctuations on United' s financial results, the Company hedged some
of the risk of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future foreign
currency revenues by purchasing put options (consisting of Japanese yen,
euro, Australian dollars and British pounds) and selling Hong Kong dollar
forwards.&nbsp; To reduce hedging costs, the Company sells a correlation
option in the first four currencies referred to above.&nbsp; United also
attempts to reduce its exposure to transaction gains and losses by converting
excess local currencies generated to U.S. dollars on a timely basis and
by entering into currency forward or exchange contracts.&nbsp; The total
notional amount of outstanding currency options and forward exchange contracts,
and their respective fair market values as of December 31, 2000, are summarized
in <u>Item 7A.&nbsp; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk</u>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United' s foreign operations
involve insignificant amounts of physical assets; however, the Company
does have sizable intangible assets related to acquisitions of Atlantic
and Latin America route authorities.&nbsp; Operating authorities in international
markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the United
States and foreign countries.&nbsp; Changes in U.S. or foreign government
aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing
air service agreements that could adversely impact the value of United'
s international route authority.&nbsp; Significant changes in such policies
could also have a material impact on UAL' s operating revenues and results
of operations.&nbsp; In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") has issued an Exposure Draft, "Business Combinations and Intangible
Assets - Accounting for Goodwill," which could impact the Company' s accounting
for these assets.&nbsp; For further details, see "New Accounting Pronouncements"
below.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Airport Rents and Landing Fees -</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United is charged facility
rental and landing fees at virtually every airport at which it operates.&nbsp;
In recent years, many airports have increased or sought to increase rates
charged to airlines as a means of compensating for increasing demands upon
airport revenues.&nbsp; Airlines have challenged certain of these increases
through litigation and in some cases have not been successful.&nbsp; The
FAA and the DOT have instituted an administrative hearing process to judge
whether rate increases are legal and valid.&nbsp; However, to the extent
the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines
to challenge such charges is restricted, the rates charged by airports
may increase substantially.&nbsp; Management cannot predict either the
likelihood or the magnitude of any such increase.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Environmental and Legal Contingencies -</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has been named as
a Potentially Responsible Party at certain Environmental Protection Agency
("EPA") cleanup sites which have been designated as Superfund Sites.&nbsp;
United' s alleged proportionate contributions at the sites are minimal;
however, at sites where the EPA has commenced litigation, potential liability
is joint and several.&nbsp; Additionally, United has participated and is
participating in remediation actions at certain other sites, primarily
airports.&nbsp; The estimated cost of these actions is accrued when it
is determined that it is probable that United is liable.&nbsp; Environmental
regulations and remediation processes are subject to future change, and
determining the actual cost of remediation will require further investigation
and remediation experience.&nbsp; Therefore, the ultimate cost cannot be
determined at this time.&nbsp; However, while such cost may vary from United'
s current estimate, United believes the difference between its accrued
reserve and the ultimate liability will not be material.*
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL has certain other contingencies
resulting from this and other litigation and claims incident to the ordinary
course of business.&nbsp; Management believes, after considering a number
of factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal counsel,
the nature of such contingencies and prior experience, that the ultimate
disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially affect UAL'
s financial condition, operating results or liquidity.*
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Common Stock Dividends -</b>
<p><font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During 2000, UAL instituted an annual dividend of $1.25 per share on UAL
common stock.&nbsp; Accordingly, UAL paid $36 million ($0.3125 per share)
in common dividends in each of the second, third and fourth quarters of
2000.&nbsp; In addition, on December 14, UAL' s Board of Directors declared
a dividend of $0.3125 per share payable on February 1, 2001 to stockholders
of record January 16, 2001.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">New Accounting Pronouncements
- -</font></b>
<p><font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"
("SFAS No. 133"), which establishes accounting and reporting standards
requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet
as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.&nbsp; SFAS
No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative' s fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.&nbsp;
Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative' s gains and
losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement,
and requires that a company must formally document, designate and assess
the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The effective date of SFAS No. 133 was delayed one year, to fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000.&nbsp; The Company plans to adopt SFAS No.
133, which was subsequently amended by SFAS No. 138, in the first quarter
of 2001.&nbsp; United has reviewed its various contracts to determine which
contracts meet the requirements of SFAS No. 133, as amended, and need to
be reflected as derivatives under the standard and accounted for at fair
value.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Company will recognize a charge for the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle of $8 million, net of tax, in
the first quarter 2001.&nbsp; In addition, the Company believes the adoption
of SFAS 133 will increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive
income.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On February 14, 2001, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft "Business Combinations
and Intangible Assets - Accounting for Goodwill."&nbsp; The Exposure Draft
requires the use of a non-amortization approach to account for purchased
goodwill and for separately recognized (non-goodwill) intangible assets
that have an indefinite useful economic life.&nbsp; Under this approach,
goodwill and certain intangibles would not be amortized, but would be written
down and expensed against earnings only in periods in which the recorded
value is more than the fair value.&nbsp; The Company has not yet quantified
the impacts of adopting the new Exposure Draft, but it could result in
significant changes to the classification and recording of intangibles
and amortization expense currently on the books, as well as the accounting
for the planned acquisition of US Airways.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font face="Tms Rmn,Times New Roman">Outlook for 2001*-</font></u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The softening of the U.S.
economy has had an industry-wide effect on business travel; as a result,
the Company has experienced a decrease in high-yield near-term bookings.&nbsp;
In addition, passenger revenue performance is expected to be negatively
impacted by the reduced capacity level put in place to improve operational
reliability.&nbsp; Given these weaker-than-anticipated revenues, combined
with higher labor costs and fuel prices, the Company expects first-quarter
results to be substantially below the current First Call consensus of $2.82
loss per share.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company had previously
provided full-year guidance, including the possible effects of its planned
acquisition of US Airways, based on business plans prepared before the
onset of the revenue deterioration.&nbsp; With the weakening of the U.S.
economic situation, the Company has taken steps to reduce planned 2001
spending by $200 million.&nbsp; However, based on expectations that revenue
weakness will continue, the Company now expects performance to be below
plan levels for the full year.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The uncertainty surrounding
key factors affecting the Company' s financial performance, such as the
breadth and length of the U.S. economic slowdown, the outcome of the planned
United and US Airways merger and the outcome of labor negotiations and
the cost of fuel, among other factors, precludes the Company from providing
any specific estimates on results at this time.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information included in the

and involves risks and uncertainties that could result in actual results
differing materially from expected results.&nbsp; Forward-looking statements
represent the Company' s expectations and beliefs concerning future events,
based on information available to the Company as of the date of this filing.&nbsp;
Some factors that could significantly impact revenues, expenses, unit costs,
and the results and benefits of the pending merger between United and US
Airways include, without limitation, the airline pricing environment; industry
capacity decisions; competitors'&nbsp; route decisions; obtaining regulatory
approvals for the United and US Airways merger; successfully integrating
the businesses of United and US Airways; costs related to the United and
US Airways merger; achieving cost-cutting synergies resulting from the
United and US Airways merger; labor integration issues; the ultimate outcome
of existing litigation; the success of the Company' s cost-control efforts;
the cost of crude oil and jet fuel; the results of union contract negotiations
and their impact on labor costs; operational disruptions as a result of
bad weather, air traffic control-related difficulties and labor issues;
the growth of e-commerce and off-tariff distribution channels; the effective
deployment of customer service tools and resources; actions of the U.S.,
foreign and local governments; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
the economic environment of the airline industry and the economic environment
in general.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Item 7A.&nbsp; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Interest Rate Risk -</b>
United' s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates
relates primarily to its debt obligations and short-term investments.&nbsp;
United does not use derivative financial instruments in its investments
portfolio.&nbsp; United' s policy is to manage interest rate risk through
a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements,
depending upon market conditions.&nbsp; A portion of the borrowings are
denominated in foreign currencies which exposes the Company to risks associated
with changes in foreign exchange rates.&nbsp; To hedge against some of
this risk, the Company has placed foreign currency deposits (primarily
for Japanese yen, French francs, German marks and euros) to meet foreign
currency lease obligations designated in the respective currencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on the foreign currency
deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations,
the Company reduces its overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
volatility.&nbsp; The fair value of these deposits is determined based
on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate.&nbsp;
The fair value of long-term debt is based on the quoted market prices for
the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows using
a U.S. Treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument,
adjusted by a credit spread.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Foreign Currency Risk
- -</b> United has established a foreign currency hedging program using currency
forwards and options (purchasing put options and selling correlation options)
to hedge exposure to the Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar, British pound,
Australian dollar and the euro.&nbsp; The goal of the hedging program is
to effectively manage risk associated with fluctuations in the value of
the foreign currency, thereby making financial results more stable and
predictable.&nbsp; United does not use currency forwards or currency options
for trading purposes.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of December 31, 1999,
United had $144 million of Japanese yen purchased forwards outstanding
with a fair value of $(1) million, $62 million yen sold forwards with a
fair value of $0 and $402 million yen put options with a fair value of
$7 million.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Price Risk (Aircraft Fuel)
- -</b> When market conditions indicate risk reduction is achievable, United
enters into fuel option contracts to reduce its price risk exposure to
jet fuel.&nbsp; The option contracts are designed to provide protection
against sharp increases in the price of aircraft fuel.&nbsp; Based on current
market conditions, United does not believe risk reduction is achievable
and is no longer entering into new option contracts.&nbsp; As market conditions
change, so may United' s hedging program.&nbsp; In addition, to a limited
extent, United trades short-term heating oil futures and option contracts,
which are immaterial.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 1999, United
had $1.1 billion in purchased call option contracts for crude oil with
an estimated fair value of $120 million.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=-1>*Estimated fair values represent the amount United would
pay/receive on December 31, 2000 to terminate the contracts.</font>

<p><u>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</u></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>To the Stockholders and
<p>Board of Directors, UAL Corporation:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We have audited the accompanying statements of consolidated financial
position of UAL Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiary companies
as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related statements of consolidated
operations, consolidated cash flows and consolidated stockholders'&nbsp;
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000.&nbsp;
These financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility
of the Company' s management.&nbsp; Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States.&nbsp; Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.&nbsp; An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.&nbsp; An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.&nbsp;
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UAL
Corporation and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>As explained in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed certain of its accounting
principles for revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.&nbsp; The schedule referenced in
Item 14(a) 2 herein is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission' s rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements.&nbsp; This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be
set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole.

<p><br>
<br>
<p><b><u>(1)&nbsp; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(a)&nbsp; Basis of
Presentation</i> -</b> UAL Corporation ("UAL") is a holding company whose
principal subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc. ("United").&nbsp; The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of UAL and all of its majority-owned
affiliates (collectively "the Company").&nbsp; All significant intercompany
transactions are eliminated. Certain prior-year financial statement items
have been reclassified to conform to the current year' s presentation.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(b)&nbsp; Use of Estimates</i>
- -</b> The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.&nbsp; Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(c)&nbsp; Airline Revenues</i>
- -</b> Passenger fares and cargo revenues are recorded as operating revenues
when the transportation is furnished.&nbsp; The value of unused passenger
tickets is included in current liabilities.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; Cash and
Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments</i> -</b> Cash in excess of
operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing
investments.&nbsp; Investments with a maturity of three months or less
on their acquisition date are classified as cash and cash equivalents.&nbsp;
Other investments are classified as short-term investments.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, United
lends certain of its securities classified as cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments to third parties.&nbsp; United requires collateral
in an amount exceeding the value of the securities and is obligated to
reacquire the securities at the end of the contract.&nbsp; United accounts
for these transactions as secured borrowings rather than sales and does
not remove the securities from the balance sheet.&nbsp; At December 31,
2000, United was obligated to repurchase $39 million of securities lent
to third parties.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000 and
1999, $598 million and $406 million, respectively, of investments in debt
securities included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
were classified as available-for-sale, and $1.7 billion and $177 million,
respectively, were classified as held-to-maturity.&nbsp; Investments in
debt securities classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair value
based on the quoted market prices for the securities, which does not differ
significantly from their cost basis.&nbsp; Investments classified as held-to-maturity
are stated at cost which approximates market due to their short-term maturities.&nbsp;
The gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale securities are included
in interest income for each respective year.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp; Derivative
Financial Instruments</i> -</b>
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign Currency</i>
- - </b>From time to time, United enters into Japanese yen forward exchange
contracts to minimize gains and losses on the revaluation of short-term
yen-denominated liabilities.&nbsp; The yen forwards typically have short-term
maturities and are marked to fair value at the end of each accounting period.&nbsp;
The unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on the yen forwards generally
offset the losses and gains recorded on the yen liabilities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has also entered
into forwards and swaps to reduce exposure to currency fluctuations on
Japanese yen-, euro- and French franc-denominated capital lease obligations.&nbsp;
The cash flows of the forwards and swaps mirror those of the capital leases.&nbsp;
The premiums on the forwards and swaps, as measured at inception, are being
amortized over their respective lives as components of interest expense.&nbsp;
Any gains or losses realized upon early termination of these forwards and
swaps are deferred and recognized in income over the remaining life of
the underlying exposure.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company hedges
some of the risks of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future
Japanese yen, euro, Australian dollar and British pound revenues by purchasing
put options with little or no intrinsic value and on Hong Kong dollar revenues
by entering into forward contracts.&nbsp; The amount and duration of these
options are synchronized with the expected revenues, and thus, the put
options have been designated as a hedge.&nbsp; The premiums on purchased
option contracts are amortized over the lives of the contracts.&nbsp; Unrealized
gains on purchased put option contracts are deferred until contract expiration
and then recognized as a component of passenger revenue.&nbsp; To reduce
hedging costs, the Company sells a correlation option in the first four
currencies referred to above.&nbsp; The unrealized mark-to-market gains
and losses on the correlation options are included in Miscellaneous, net,
net of premiums received.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Interest Rates</i>
- -</b> United may from time to time, enter into swaps to reduce exposure
to interest rate fluctuations in connection with certain debt, capital
leases and operating leases.&nbsp; The cash flows of the swaps mirror those
of the underlying exposures.&nbsp; The premiums on the swaps, as measured
at inception, are amortized over their respective lives as components of
interest expense.&nbsp; Any gains or losses realized upon the early termination
of these swaps are deferred and recognized in income over the remaining
life of the underlying exposure.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Aircraft Fuel</i>
- -</b> Under favorable market conditions, United uses purchased call options
to hedge a portion of its price risk related to aircraft fuel purchases.&nbsp;
The purchased call options have been designated as a hedge.&nbsp; Gains
or losses on hedge positions, net of premiums paid, are recognized upon
contract expiration as a component of aircraft fuel inventory.&nbsp; In
addition, to a limited extent, United trades short-term heating oil futures
contracts.&nbsp; Unrealized losses on these contracts are recorded currently
in income while unrealized gains are deferred until contract expiration.&nbsp;
Both gains and losses are recorded as a component of aircraft fuel expense.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(f)&nbsp; Aircraft
Fuel, Spare Parts and Supplies</i> -</b> Aircraft fuel and maintenance
and operating supplies are stated at average cost.&nbsp; Flight equipment
spare parts are stated at average cost less an obsolescence allowance.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(g)&nbsp; Operating
Property and Equipment</i> -</b> Owned operating property and equipment
is stated at cost.&nbsp; Property under capital leases, and the related
obligation for future lease payments, are initially recorded at an amount
equal to the then present value of those lease payments.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depreciation and amortization
of owned depreciable assets is based on the straight-line method over their
estimated service lives.&nbsp; Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the remaining period of the lease or the estimated service life of the
related asset, whichever is less.&nbsp; Aircraft are depreciated to estimated
salvage values, generally over lives of 4 to 30 years; buildings are depreciated
over lives of 25 to 45 years; and other property and equipment are depreciated
over lives of 3 to 15 years.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Properties under capital
leases are amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease,
or in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated service lives.&nbsp;
Lease terms are 10 to 30 years for aircraft and flight simulators and 25
years for buildings.&nbsp; Amortization of capital leases is included in
depreciation and amortization expense.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of minor replacements, are charged to maintenance expense
accounts.&nbsp; Costs of additions to and renewals of units of property
are charged to property and equipment accounts.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(h)&nbsp; Intangibles</i>
- -</b> Intangibles consist primarily of route acquisition costs and intangible
pension assets (see Note 16 "Retirement and Postretirement Plans").&nbsp;
Route acquisition costs are amortized over 40 years.&nbsp; During 2001,
the FASB issued an Exposure Draft "Business Combinations and Intangible
Assets - Accounting for Goodwill" which could impact the Company' s accounting
for intangible assets.&nbsp; See <i>Other Information, </i>"New Accounting
Pronouncements" in <u>Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations</u>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(i)&nbsp; Mileage
Plus Awards</i> -</b> United accrues the estimated incremental cost of
providing free travel awards earned under its Mileage Plus frequent flyer
program when such award levels are reached.&nbsp; United, through its wholly
owned subsidiary, Mileage Plus Holdings, Inc., sells mileage credits to
participating partners in the Mileage Plus program.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective January 1,
2000, the Company changed its method of accounting for the sale of mileage
to participating partners in its Mileage Plus program, in accordance with
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."&nbsp;
Under the new accounting method, a portion of revenue from the sale of
mileage (previously recognized in other revenue) is deferred and recognized
as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided.&nbsp; Accordingly,
UAL has recorded a charge of $209 million, net of tax, for the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the application of
the accounting method to prior years.&nbsp; This change resulted in a reduction
to revenues of approximately $38 million for 2000 and would have reduced
1999 revenues by $45 million.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pro forma effect
of the accounting change on net income and earnings per share as previously
reported for 1999 and prior years is as follows:

<p><b><u>(2)&nbsp; Employee Stock Ownership Plans and Recapitalization</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 12, 1994, the
stockholders of UAL approved a plan of recapitalization to provide an approximately
55% equity interest in UAL to certain employees of United in exchange for
wage concessions and work-rule changes.&nbsp; The employees'&nbsp; equity
interest was allocated to individual employees through the year 2000 under
Employee Stock Ownership Plans ("ESOPs") which were created as a part of
the recapitalization.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ESOPs cover employees
represented by ALPA, the IAM and U.S. management and salaried employees.&nbsp;
The ESOPs include a "Leveraged ESOP," a "Non-Leveraged ESOP" and a "Supplemental
ESOP."&nbsp; Both the Leveraged ESOP and the Non-Leveraged ESOP are tax-qualified
plans while the Supplemental ESOP is not a tax-qualified plan.&nbsp; Shares
are delivered to employees primarily through the Leveraged ESOP, then through
the Non-Leveraged ESOP, and finally, through the Supplemental ESOP.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The equity interests
were delivered to employees through two classes of preferred stock (Class
1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, collectively "ESOP Preferred Stock"),
and the voting interests were delivered through three separate classes
of preferred stocks (Class P, M and S Voting Preferred Stock, collectively,
"Voting Preferred Stock").&nbsp; The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock was delivered
to an ESOP trust in seven separate sales under the Leveraged ESOP, the
last of which occurred on January 5, 2000.&nbsp; Based on Internal Revenue
Code Limitations, shares of the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock are either
contributed to the Non-Leveraged ESOP or allocated as "book entry" shares
to the Supplemental ESOP annually through the year 2000.&nbsp; The classes
of preferred stock are described more fully in Note 13, "ESOP Preferred
Stock."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Leveraged ESOP
and Non-Leveraged ESOP are being accounted for under AICPA Statement of
Position 93-6, "Employers'&nbsp; Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership
Plans."&nbsp; For the Leveraged ESOP, as shares of Class 1 ESOP Preferred
Stock are sold to an ESOP trust, the Company reports the issuance as a
credit to additional capital invested and records a corresponding charge
to unearned ESOP preferred stock.&nbsp; ESOP compensation expense is recorded
for the average fair value of the shares committed to be released during
the period with a corresponding credit to unearned ESOP preferred stock
for the cost of the shares.&nbsp; Any difference between the fair value
of the shares and the cost of the shares is charged or credited to additional
capital invested.&nbsp; For the Non-Leveraged ESOP, the Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock is recorded as additional capital invested as the shares are committed
to be contributed, with the offsetting charge to ESOP compensation expense.&nbsp;
The ESOP compensation expense is based on the average fair value of the
shares committed to be contributed.&nbsp; The Supplemental ESOP is being
accounted for under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock are legally released or allocated to employee accounts as of year-end.&nbsp;
Dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock are also paid at the end of the year.&nbsp;
Dividends on unallocated shares are used by the ESOP to pay down the loan
from UAL and are not considered dividends for financial reporting purposes.&nbsp;
Dividends on allocated shares are satisfied by releasing shares from the
ESOP' s suspense account to the employee accounts and are charged to equity.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, 2,390,931
shares of Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock, 434,465 shares of Class 2 ESOP
Preferred Stock and 2,819,479 shares of Voting Preferred Stock were allocated
to employee accounts, and another 248,572 shares of Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock were allocated in the form of "book entry" shares, effective December
31, 1999.&nbsp; Another 198,629 shares of Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock
previously allocated in book entry form were issued and either contributed
to the qualified plan or converted and sold on behalf of terminating employees.&nbsp;
At December 31, 2000, the year-end allocation of Class 1 ESOP Preferred
Stock to employee accounts had not yet been completed; however, there were
669,820 shares of Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock committed to be released.&nbsp;
For the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, 187,276 shares were committed to
be contributed to employees at December 31, 2000.&nbsp; The fair value
of the unearned ESOP shares recorded on the balance sheet at December 31,
1999 was $41 million.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Class 2 ESOP
Preferred Stock committed to be contributed to employees under the Supplemental
ESOP, employees can elect to receive their "book entry" shares in cash
upon termination of employment.&nbsp; The estimated fair value of such
shares at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $304 million and $954 million,
respectively.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000, stock
options to purchase 5,646,557 shares of common stock were outstanding,
but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share,
because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average
market price of the common shares.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>(6)&nbsp; Investments</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, UAL invested
approximately $24 million in Orbitz, an entity which is developing an Internet
travel web site.&nbsp; UAL owns approximately 25% of Orbitz and accounts
for this investment using the equity method of accounting.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 1998 and 1999, United
invested approximately $51 million in GetThere.com (a leading provider
of Internet-based travel planning products tailored to individual, corporate,
travel supplier and travel agency customers) resulting in a 28% minority
interest consisting of common stock, warrants and options.&nbsp; United
accounted for its investment in GetThere.com using the equity method of
accounting.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On October 6, 2000, Sabre
Holdings Corporation acquired all of the outstanding common stock of GetThere.com
for $17.75 per share.&nbsp; Accordingly, after converting its options and
warrants, United tendered all of its shares for net proceeds of $147 million,
resulting in a gain of approximately $69 million, net of tax.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, United recorded
an impairment loss of $38 million, net of tax, related to its warrants
held in Priceline.com.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 1999, United sold
17,500,000 common shares of Galileo in a secondary offering for $766 million,
resulting in a gain of approximately $428 million, net of tax.&nbsp; This
sale reduced United' s holdings in Galileo from 32 percent to approximately
15 percent, requiring United to discontinue the equity method of accounting
for its investment in Galileo.&nbsp; United has classified its remaining
15,940,000 shares of Galileo common stock as available-for-sale.&nbsp;
The market value of these shares at December 31, 2000 ($319 million) is
reflected in investments on the balance sheet and the market value in excess
of United' s investment is classified net-of-tax ($144 million) in accumulated
other comprehensive income.&nbsp; The market value of United' s investment
in Galileo at December 31, 1999 was $477 million.&nbsp; Included in the
Company' s retained earnings is approximately $248 million of undistributed
earnings of Galileo and its predecessor companies.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United owns 1,391,791
depositary certificates in Equant, a provider of international data network
services to multinational businesses and a single source for global desktop
communications.&nbsp; Each depositary certificate represents a beneficial
interest in an Equant common share and the investment is classified as
available-for-sale.&nbsp; The market value in excess of United' s investment
is classified net-of-tax ($24 million) in accumulated other comprehensive
income.&nbsp; In December 1999, United sold 709,000 shares of common stock
in Equant in a secondary offering by Equant for $62 million.&nbsp; At December
31, 2000 and 1999, the estimated fair value of United' s remaining investment
in Equant was approximately $36 million and $156 million, respectively.
<p><b><u>(7)&nbsp; Income Taxes</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2000, UAL incurred
both a regular and an alternative minimum tax ("AMT") loss.&nbsp; The carryback
of the regular tax loss to 1999 and 1998 and the carryback loss of the
AMT loss to 1998 will produce both federal and state refunds and generate
additional AMT credits.&nbsp; The primary differences between UAL' s regular
tax loss and AMT loss are the depreciation adjustments and preferences.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provision for income
taxes is summarized as follows:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has an agreement
with a syndicate of banks for a $750 million revolving credit facility
expiring in 2002.&nbsp; Interest on drawn amounts under the facility is
calculated at floating rates based on the London interbank offered rate
("LIBOR") plus a margin which is subject to adjustment based on certain
changes in the credit ratings of United' s long-term senior unsecured debt.&nbsp;
Among other restrictions, the credit facility contains a covenant that
restricts United' s ability to grant liens on or otherwise encumber certain
identified assets with a market value of approximately $1.1 billion.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, United
has available $900 million in short-term secured aircraft financing facilities.&nbsp;
Interest on drawn amounts under the facilities is calculated at floating
rates based on LIBOR plus a margin.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 1999,
United had outstanding $61 million under a separate short-term borrowing
facility, bearing an average interest rate of 5.72%.&nbsp; Receivables
amounting to $233 million were pledged by United to secure repayment of
such outstanding borrowings.&nbsp; The maximum available borrowing amount
under this arrangement is $227 million.&nbsp; There were no borrowings
outstanding under this arrangement at December 31, 2000.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to scheduled
principal payments, in 2000 and 1999 the Company repaid $116 million and
$23 million, respectively, in principal amount of debentures prior to maturity.&nbsp;
The debentures were scheduled to mature at various times through 2021.&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company, through
a special-purpose financing entity that is consolidated, has issued commercial
paper to refinance certain lease commitments.&nbsp; Although the issued
commercial paper has short maturities, the Company expects to continually
rollover this obligation throughout the 5-year life of its supporting liquidity
facility or bank standby facility.&nbsp; As such, the commercial paper
is classified as a long-term obligation in the Company' s statement of
financial position.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

after refinancing the operating leases was $622 million.&nbsp; In December
2000, the Company issued an additional $1.5 billion in enhanced equipment
trust certificates to refinance certain owned aircraft.

United had recorded $255 million in special facilities revenue bonds to
finance the acquisition and construction of certain facilities at Los Angeles,
San Francisco and Miami.&nbsp; United guarantees the payment of these bonds
under various payment and loan agreements.&nbsp; The bond proceeds are
restricted to expenditures on the facilities and unspent amounts are classified
as other assets in the balance sheet.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February 2001, United
recorded an additional $200 million in special facility bonds to finance
the acquisition and construction of certain facilities at Chicago.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000,
United had outstanding a total of $1.4 billion of long-term debt bearing
interest rates at 22.5 to 60.0 basis points over LIBOR.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maturities of long-term
debt for each of the four years after 2001 are:&nbsp; 2002 - $655 million;
2003 - $741 million; 2004 - $350 million; and 2005 - $264 million.&nbsp;
Various assets, principally aircraft, having an aggregate book value of
$4.1 billion at December 31, 2000, were pledged as security under various
loan agreements.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amounts charged to rent expense,
net of minor amounts of sublease rentals, were $1.5 billion in 2000, $1.4
billion in 1999 and $1.4 billion in 1998.&nbsp; Included in 2000 rental
expense was $21 million in contingent rentals, resulting from changes in
interest rates for operating leases under which the rent payments are based
on variable interest rates.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>(11)&nbsp; Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred
Securities of a</u></b>
<p><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsidiary Trust</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December 1996, UAL Corporation
Capital Trust I (the "Trust") issued $75 million of its 13 1/4% Trust Originated
Preferred Securities (the "Preferred Securities") in exchange for 2,999,304
depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of one share of Series B 12
1/4% preferred stock (see Note 12 "Serial Preferred Stock").&nbsp; Concurrent
with the issuance of the Preferred Securities and the related purchase
by UAL of the Trust' s common securities, the Company issued to the Trust
$77 million aggregate principal amount of its 13 1/4% Junior Subordinated
Debentures (the "Debentures") due 2026.&nbsp; The Debentures are and will
be the sole assets of the Trust.&nbsp; The interest and other payment dates
on the Debentures correspond to the distribution and other payment dates
on the Preferred Securities.&nbsp; Upon maturity or redemption of the Debentures,
the Preferred Securities will be mandatorily redeemed.&nbsp; The Debentures
are redeemable at UAL' s option, in whole or in part, on or after July
12, 2004, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to
be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.&nbsp;
Upon the repayment of the Debentures, the proceeds thereof will be applied
to redeem the Preferred Securities.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a full and unconditional
guarantee by UAL of the Trust' s obligations under the securities issued
by the Trust.&nbsp; However, the Company' s obligations are subordinate
and junior in right of payment to certain other of its indebtedness.&nbsp;
UAL has the right to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by extending
the interest payment period, at any time, for up to 20 consecutive quarters.&nbsp;
If interest payments on the Debentures are so deferred, distributions on
the Preferred Securities will also be deferred.&nbsp; During any deferral,
distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon.&nbsp; In addition,
during any such deferral, UAL may not declare or pay any dividend or other
distribution on, or redeem or purchase, any of its capital stock.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fair value of the Preferred
Securities at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $85 million and $83 million,
respectively.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>(12)&nbsp; Serial Preferred Stock</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000, UAL
had outstanding 3,203,177 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of
one share of Series B 12 1/4% preferred stock, with a liquidation preference
of $25 per depositary share ($25,000 per Series B preferred share) and
a stated capital of $0.01 per Series B preferred share.&nbsp; Under its
terms, any portion of the Series B preferred stock or the depositary shares
is redeemable for cash after July 11, 2004, at UAL' s option, at the equivalent
of $25 per depositary share, plus accrued dividends.&nbsp; The Series B
preferred stock is not convertible into any other securities, has no stated
maturity and is not subject to mandatory redemption.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Series B preferred stock
ranks senior to all other preferred and common stock, except the Preferred
Securities, as to receipt of dividends and amounts distributed upon liquidation.&nbsp;
The Series B preferred stock has voting rights only to the extent required
by law and with respect to charter amendments that adversely affect the
preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any security ranking senior
to the preferred stock.&nbsp; Additionally, if dividends are not paid for
six cumulative quarters, the Series B preferred stockholders are entitled
to elect two additional members to the UAL Board of Directors until all
dividends are paid in full.&nbsp; Pursuant to UAL' s restated certificate
of incorporation, UAL is authorized to issue a total of 50,000 shares of
Series B preferred stock.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 1998, UAL repurchased
64,300 depositary shares, at an aggregate cost of $3 million, to be held
in treasury.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL is authorized to issue
up to 15,986,584 additional shares of serial preferred stock.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, 1999 and
1998, the Company repurchased 1,258,263, 3,754,802 and 7,061,109 shares
of common stock, respectively, at a total purchase price of $81 million,
$261 million and $459 million, respectively.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>(15) Stock Options and Awards</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has granted
options to purchase common stock to various officers and employees.&nbsp;
The option price for all stock options is at least 100% of the fair market
value of UAL common stock at the date of grant.&nbsp; Options generally
vest and become exercisable in four equal, annual installments beginning
one year after the date of grant, and generally expire in ten years.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the
1994 recapitalization, all outstanding options became fully vested at the
time of the transaction and those options are exercisable for shares of
old common stock, each of which is in turn converted into two shares of
new common stock and $84.81 in cash upon exercise.&nbsp; Subsequent to
the recapitalization, the Company granted stock options which are exercisable
for shares of new common stock.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has also
awarded shares of restricted stock to officers and key employees.&nbsp;
These shares generally vest over a five-year period and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances
prior to vesting.&nbsp; Unearned compensation, representing the fair market
value of the stock at the measurement date for the award, is amortized
to salaries and related costs over the vesting period.&nbsp; During 2000
and 1999, respectively, 23,000 and 75,000 shares of restricted stock were
issued from treasury.&nbsp; No shares were issued in 1998.&nbsp; As of
December 31, 2000, 98,000 shares were restricted and still nonvested.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, 265,952 shares were reserved for future awards under the
plan.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No.
123") establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock options.&nbsp;
The Company has elected to continue using the intrinsic value method of
accounting prescribed in APB 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123.&nbsp; Had
compensation cost for awards been determined based on the fair value at
the grant dates consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123, the Company'
s net income and earnings per share would have instead been reported as
the pro forma amounts indicated below:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.&nbsp;
In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including expected stock price volatility.&nbsp; Because the
Company' s stock options have characteristics significantly different from
those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management' s opinion,
the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure
of the fair value of its stock options.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes in interest rates
or rates of inflation may impact the assumptions used in the valuation
of pension obligations and postretirement obligations including discount
rates and rates of increase in compensation, resulting in increases or
decreases in United' s pension and postretirement liabilities and pension
and postretirement costs.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>(17)&nbsp; Financial Instruments and Risk Management</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See <u>Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</u> ("Item 7A") for a discussion
of the Company' s foreign currency and fuel price risk management activities,
and the fair value of all significant financial instruments.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Credit Exposures of Derivatives</i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company' s theoretical
risk in the derivative financial instruments described in Item 7A is the
cost of replacing the contracts at current market rates in the event of
default by any of the counterparties.&nbsp; However, the Company does not
anticipate such default as counterparties are selected based on credit
ratings and the relative market positions with each counterparty are monitored.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Financial Guarantees</i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special facility revenue
bonds have been issued by certain municipalities to build or improve airport
and maintenance facilities leased by United.&nbsp; Under the lease agreements,
United is required to make rental payments in amounts sufficient to pay
the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds.&nbsp; At December
31, 2000, $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds was outstanding.&nbsp;
As of December 31, 2000, UAL and United had jointly guaranteed $35 million
of such bonds and United had guaranteed $1.2 billion of such bonds, including
accrued interest.&nbsp; The payments required to satisfy these obligations
are included in the future minimum lease payments disclosed in Note 10,
"Lease Obligations."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Concentrations of Credit Risk</i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company does not believe
it is subject to any significant concentration of credit risk.&nbsp; Most
of the Company' s receivables result from sales of tickets to individuals
through geographically dispersed travel agents, company outlets or other
airlines, often through the use of major credit cards.&nbsp; These receivables
are short term, generally being settled shortly after the sale.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>(18)&nbsp; Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has certain contingencies
resulting from litigation and claims (including environmental issues) incident
to the ordinary course of business.&nbsp; Management believes, after considering
a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal
counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and
its prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies
is not expected to materially affect UAL' s consolidated financial position
or results of operations.&nbsp; UAL records liabilities for legal and environmental
claims against it in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.&nbsp;
These amounts are recorded based on the Company' s assessments of the likelihood
of their eventual settlements.&nbsp; The amounts of these liabilities could
increase or decrease in the near term, based on revisions to estimates
relating to the various claims.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000, commitments
for the purchase of property and equipment, principally aircraft, approximated
$4.7 billion, after deducting advance payments.&nbsp; An estimated $2.5
billion will be spent in 2001, $1.7 billion in 2002 and $0.5 in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The major commitments are for the purchase of A319, A320, B767, and B777
aircraft, which are scheduled to be delivered through 2003.&nbsp; The above
numbers include a recent conversion of 15 option aircraft to firm orders
to be delivered in 2003.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the construction
of the Indianapolis Maintenance Center, United agreed to spend an aggregate
$800 million on capital investments by the year 2001 and employ at least
7,500 individuals by the year 2004.&nbsp; In the event such targets are
not reached, United may be required to make certain payments to the city
of Indianapolis and state of Indiana.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 80% of United'
s employees are represented by various labor organizations.&nbsp; The labor
contracts with the IAM became amendable in July 2000.&nbsp; The Company
is currently in the process of negotiating these contracts.&nbsp; The contracts
with ALPA and the AFA become amendable in 2004 and 2006, respectively.&nbsp;
See <i>Other Information</i>, "Labor Agreements" in <u>Management' s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</u> for details.
<p><b><u>(19)&nbsp; Segment Information</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has a global route
network designed to transport passengers and cargo between destinations
in North America, the Pacific, the Atlantic and Latin America.&nbsp; These
regions constitute United' s four reportable segments.&nbsp; The accounting
policies for each of these segments are the same as those described in
Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," except that segment
financial information has been prepared using a management approach which
is consistent with how the Company' s management internally disaggregates
financial information for the purpose of making internal operating decisions.&nbsp;
UAL evaluates performance based on United' s earnings before income taxes
and gains on sales.&nbsp; Revenues are attributed to each reportable segment
based on the allocation guidelines provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation,
which classifies flights between the U.S. and foreign designations as part
of each respective region.&nbsp; A reconciliation of the total amounts
reported by reportable segments to the applicable amounts in the financial
statements follows:

<p>FORM OF RECEIPTS, DEPOSIT OF STOCK, EXECUTION AND DELIVERY, TRANSFER,
SURRENDER AND REDEMPTION OF RECEIPTS
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Form and Transfer
of Receipts. Definitive Receipts shall be engraved or printed or lithographed
on steel-engraved borders, with appropriate insertions, modifications and
omissions as hereinafter provided, if required by any securities exchange
on which the Receipts are listed. Pending the preparation of definitive
Receipts or if definitive Receipts are not required by any securities exchange
on which the Receipts are listed, the Depositary, upon the written order
of the Company or any holder of Stock, as the case may be, delivered in
compliance with Section 2.2, shall execute and deliver temporary Receipts
that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise
substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which
they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions
and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine,
as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts. If temporary Receipts
are issued, the Company and the Depositary shall cause definitive Receipts
to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive
Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts
upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary's Office or
at such other place or places as the Depositary shall determine, without
charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more
temporary Receipts, the Depositary shall execute and deliver in exchange
therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary
Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts.
Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge
to the holder therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall
in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement,
and with respect to the Stock, as definitive Receipts.
<p>Receipts shall be executed by the Depositary by the manual signature
of a duly authorized officer of the Depositary; provided that such signature
may be a facsimile if a Registrar for the Receipts (other than the Depositary)
shall have been appointed and such Receipts are countersigned by a manual
signature of a duly authorized officer of the Registrar. No Receipt shall
be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or
obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed manually
by a duly authorized officer of the Depositary or, if a Registrar for the
Receipts (other than the Depositary) shall have been appointed, by manual
or facsimile signature of a duly authorized officer of the Depositary and
countersigned manually by a duly authorized officer of such Registrar.
The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt so signed and delivered
as hereinafter provided.
<p>Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary
Shares. The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such
quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary
to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
<p>Receipts may be endorsed with or have incorporated in the text thereof
such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions
of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by the Depositary or required
to comply with any applicable law or any regulation thereunder or with
the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which the Stock,
the Depositary Shares or the Receipts may be listed or to conform with
any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations
or restrictions to which any particular Receipts are subject.
<p>Title to Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt, which is properly
endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer,
shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of
a negotiable instrument; provided that until transfer of a Receipt shall
be registered on the books of the Depositary as provided in Section 2.3,
the Depositary may, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, treat the
record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the
purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends
or other distributions or to any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement
and for all other purposes.
<p>On each date on which the Stock is initially issued by the Company,
the Depositary, upon receipt of written instructions from the Company and
a certificate or certificates for the Stock to be deposited under this
Deposit Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1,
shall execute and deliver a Receipt or Receipts for the number of Depositary
Shares representing such deposited Stock to the person or persons stated
in such instructions as provided in Section 2.2.
<p>If required by the Depositary, Stock presented for deposit at any time,
whether or not the register of stockholders of the Company is closed, shall
also be accompanied by an agreement or assignment, or other instrument
satisfactory to the Depositary, that shall provide for the prompt transfer
to the Depositary or its assigns of any dividend or right to subscribe
for additional Stock or to receive other property that any person in whose
name the Stock is or has been registered may thereafter receive upon or
in respect of such deposited Stock or, in lieu thereof, such agreement
of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deposit of Stock;
Execution and Delivery of Receipts in Respect Thereof. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Company or any holder of
Stock may from time to time deposit shares of the Stock under this Deposit
Agreement by delivering to the Depositary a certificate or certificates
for the Stock to be deposited, properly endorsed or accompanied, if required
by the Depositary, by a duly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement,
in form satisfactory to the Depositary, together with all such certifications
as may be required by the Depositary in accordance with the provisions
of this Deposit Agreement, and together with a written order of the Company
or such holder, as the case may be, directing the Depositary to execute
and deliver to, or upon the written order of, the person or persons stated
in such order a Receipt or Receipts for the number of Depositary Shares
representing such deposited Stock.
<p>Deposited Stock shall be held by the Depositary at the Depositary's
Office or at such other place or places as the Depositary shall determine.
<p>Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for
Stock deposited in accordance with the provisions of this Section, together
with the other documents required as above specified, and upon recordation
of the Stock on the books of the Company in the name of the Depositary
or its nominee, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver, to or upon the order
of the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary
referred to in the first paragraph of this Section, a Receipt or Receipts
for the whole number of Depositary Shares representing the Stock so deposited
and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person
or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts
at the Depositary's Office or such other offices, if any, as the Depositary
may designate. Delivery at other offices shall be at the risk and expense
of the person requesting such delivery. In each case, delivery shall be
made only upon payment as provided in Section 5.7 to the Depositary of
all taxes and other governmental charges and any fees payable in connection
with such deposit and transfer of the Stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration
of Transfer of Receipts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit
Agreement, the Depositary shall register on its books from time to time
transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person
or by duly authorized attorney, properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly
executed instrument of transfer or endorsement together with evidence of
the payment of any transfer taxes as may be required by law. Thereupon,
the Depositary shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing the same
aggregate number of Depositary Shares as those evidenced by the Receipt
or Receipts surrendered and deliver such new Receipt or Receipts to or
upon the order of the person entitled thereto.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Split-ups and
Combinations of Receipts; Surrender of Receipts and Withdrawal of Stock.
Upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary's Office or at
such other offices as it may designate for the purpose of effecting a split-up
or combination of such Receipt or Receipts, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall execute and
deliver a new Receipt or Receipts in the authorized denomination or denominations
requested, evidencing the aggregate number of Depositary Shares evidenced
by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered, provided that the Depositary shall
not issue any Receipt evidencing a fractional Depositary Share.
<p>Any holder of a Receipt or Receipts representing any number of whole
shares of Stock may (unless the related Depositary Shares have previously
been called for redemption) withdraw the Stock and all money and other
property, if any, represented thereby by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts,
at the Depositary's Office or at such other offices as the Depositary may
designate for such withdrawals. Thereafter, without unreasonable delay,
the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, or to the person or persons
designated by such holder as hereinafter provided, the number of whole
shares of Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented by
the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered for withdrawal, but holders of such
whole shares of Stock shall not thereafter be entitled to deposit such
Stock hereunder or to receive Depositary Shares therefor. If a Receipt
delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal
shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of
Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of Stock to be
so withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such
number of whole shares of Stock and such money and other property, if any,
to be so withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or upon his order, a new Receipt
evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares, provided that the Depositary
shall not issue any Receipt evidencing a fractional Depositary Share. Delivery
of the Stock and money and other property being withdrawn may be made by
the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments
as the Depositary may deem appropriate, which, if required by the Depositary,
shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer.
<p>If the Stock and the money and other property being withdrawn are to
be delivered to a person or persons other than the record holder of the
Receipt or Receipts being surrendered for withdrawal of Stock, such holders
shall execute and deliver to the Depositary a written order so directing
the Depositary and the Depositary may require that the Receipt or Receipts
surrendered by such holder for withdrawal of such shares of Stock be properly
endorsed in blank or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer
in blank.
<p>Delivery of the Stock and the money and other property, if any, represented
by Receipts surrendered for withdrawal shall be made by the Depositary
at the Depositary's Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense
of the holder surrendering such Receipt or Receipts and for the account
of the holder thereof, such delivery may be made at such other place as
may be designated by such holder.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitations on
Execution and Delivery, Transfer, Surrender and Exchange of Receipts. As
a condition precedent to the execution and delivery, registration of transfer,
split-up, combination, surrender or exchange of any Receipt, the Depositary,
the Registrar, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Company may require
payment to it of a sum sufficient for the payment (or, if the Depositary
or the Company shall have made such payment, the reimbursement to it) of
any charges or expenses payable by the holder of a Receipt pursuant to
Sections 3.2 and 5.7, may require the production of evidence satisfactory
to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature and may also
require compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depositary or
the Company may establish consistent with the provisions of this Deposit
Agreement.
<p>The deposit of Stock may be refused, the delivery of Receipts against
Stock may be suspended, the registration of transfer of Receipts may be
refused and the registration of transfer, surrender or exchange of outstanding
Receipts may be suspended (i) during any period when the register of stockholders
of the Company is closed, (ii) if any such action is deemed necessary or
advisable by the Depositary, the Registrar, any of the Depositary's Agents
or the Company at any time or from time to time because of any requirement
of law or of any government or governmental body or commission or under
any provision of this Deposit Agreement or (iii) with the approval of the
Company, for any other reason.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost Receipts,
etc. If any receipt shall be mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, the
Depositary in its discretion may execute and deliver a Receipt of like
form and tenor in exchange and substitution for such mutilated Receipt,
or in lieu of and in substitution for such destroyed, lost or stolen Receipt,
upon (i) the filing by the holder thereof with the Depositary of evidence
satisfactory to the Depositary of such destruction or loss or theft of
such Receipt, of the authenticity thereof and of his or her ownership thereof,
(ii) the furnishing of the Depositary with reasonable indemnification satisfactory
to it and (iii) the payment of any expense (including fees, charges and
expenses of the Depositary) in connection with such execution and delivery.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancellation
and Destruction of Surrendered Receipts. All Receipts surrendered to the
Depositary or any Depositary's Agent shall be cancelled by the Depositary
and returned to the Company. Except as prohibited by applicable law or
regulation, the Company is authorized to destroy all Receipts so cancelled.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Redemption of
Stock. Whenever the Company shall be permitted and shall elect to redeem
shares of Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate, it
shall (unless otherwise agreed to in writing with the Depositary) give
or cause notice to be given to the Depositary not less than 30 days, but
not more than 60 days, prior to the date of such proposed redemption of
Stock and of the number of such shares held by the Depositary to be so
redeemed and the applicable redemption price, as set forth in the Certificate,
which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Company stating
that such redemption of Stock is in accordance with the provisions of the
Certificate. On the date of such redemption, if the Company shall then
have paid or caused to be paid in full to the Depositary the redemption
price of the Stock to be redeemed, plus an amount equal to any accrued
and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, in accordance
with the provisions of the Certificate, the Depositary shall redeem the
number of Depositary Shares representing such Stock. The Depositary shall
mail notice of the Company's redemption of Stock and the proposed simultaneous
redemption of the number of Depositary Shares representing the Stock to
be redeemed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 20 days,
but not more than 50 days, prior to the date fixed for redemption of such
Stock and Depositary Shares (the "Redemption Date") to the record holders
of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at
the address of such holders as they appear on the records of the Depositary;
but neither failure to mail any such notice of redemption of Depositary
Shares to one or more such holders nor any defect in any notice of redemption
of Depositary Shares to one or more such holders shall affect the sufficiency
of the proceedings for redemption as to the other holders. The Company
shall provide the Depositary with the information necessary for the Depositary
to prepare such notice and each such notice shall state: (i) the Redemption
Date, (ii) the number of Depositary Shares to be redeemed and, if less
than all the Depositary Shares held by any such holder are to be redeemed,
the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed,
(iii) the redemption price, (iv) the place or places where Receipts evidencing
Depositary Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price,
and (v) that dividends in respect of the Stock represented by the Depositary
Shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on such Redemption Date. If
less than all the outstanding Depositary Shares are to be redeemed, the
Depositary Shares to be so redeemed shall be selected by the Depositary
by lot or pro rata (as nearly as may be) or by any other method, in each
case, as determined by the Depositary in its sole discretion to be equitable.
<p>Notice having been mailed by the Depositary as aforesaid, from and after
the Redemption Date (unless the Company shall have failed to provide the
funds necessary to redeem the Stock evidenced by the Depositary Shares
called for redemption) (i) dividends on the shares of Stock so called for
redemption shall cease to accrue from and after such date, (ii) the Depositary
Shares being redeemed from such proceeds shall be deemed no longer to be
outstanding, (iii) all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such
Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall,
to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate, and (iv)
upon surrender in accordance with such redemption notice of the Receipts
evidencing any such Depositary Shares called for redemption (properly endorsed
or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary or applicable law shall so
require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed by the Depositary at
a redemption price per Depositary Share equal to one one-thousandth (1/1,000)
of the redemption price per share paid with respect to the shares of Stock
plus all money and other property, if any, represented by such Depositary
Shares, including all amounts paid by the Company in respect of dividends
that on the Redemption Date have accumulated on the shares of Stock to
be so redeemed and have not theretofore been paid.
<p>If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are
called for redemption, the Depositary shall deliver to the holder of such
Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with the redemption
payment, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such
prior Receipt and not called for redemption. The Depositary shall not be
required (a) to issue, transfer or exchange any Receipts for a period beginning
at the opening of business ten days next preceding any selection of Depositary
Shares and Stock to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on
the day of the mailing of notice of redemption of Depositary Shares or
(b) to transfer or exchange for another Receipt any Receipt evidencing
Depositary Shares called or being called for redemption in whole or in
part, except as provided in the preceding paragraph of this Section 2.8.

<p>ARTICLE III
<p>CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF HOLDERS OF RECEIPTS AND THE COMPANY</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filing Proofs,
Certificates and Other Information. Any holder of a Receipt may be required
from time to time to file such proof of residence, or other matters or
other information, to execute such certificates and to make such representations
and warranties as the Depositary or the Company may reasonably deem necessary
or proper. The Depositary or the Company may withhold the delivery, or
delay the registration of transfer, redemption or exchange, of any Receipt
or the withdrawal or conversion of the Stock represented by the Depositary
Shares evidenced by any Receipt or the distribution of any dividend or
other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof
until such proof or other information is filed or such certificates are
executed or such representations and warranties are made.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment of Taxes
or Other Governmental Charges. If any tax or other governmental charge
shall become payable by or on behalf of the Depositary with respect to
any Receipt, the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts, the Stock
(or any beneficial interest therein) or any transaction referred to in
Section 4.6, such taxes or charges shall be payable by the holder of the
Receipts. Holders of Receipts shall also be obligated to make payments
to the Depositary of certain charges and expenses, as provided in Section
5.7. Registration of transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of Stock
and all money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary
Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused until any such payment
due is made, and any dividends or other distributions may be withheld or
any part of or all the Stock or other property represented by the Depositary
Shares evidenced by such Receipt and not theretofore sold may be sold for
the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means
to notify such holder prior to such sale), and such dividends or other
distributions or the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment
of such charges or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable
for any deficiency.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warranty as to
Stock. The Company hereby represents and warrants and each person so depositing
Stock under this Deposit Agreement shall be deemed thereby to represent
and warrant that the Stock and each certificate therefor, when issued,
shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Stock
and the issuance of Receipts.
<center>
<p>ARTICLE IV
<p>THE DEPOSITED SECURITIES; NOTICES</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cash Distributions.
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution
on Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.1 and 3.2, distribute
to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section
4.4 such amounts of such dividend or distribution as are, as nearly as
practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares
evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; provided that, if the Company
or the Depositary shall be required to withhold and shall withhold from
any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Stock an
amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation
or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed
in respect of Depositary Shares shall be reduced accordingly. If the calculation
of any such cash dividend or other cash distribution to be paid to any
record holder on the aggregate number of Receipts held by such holder results
in an amount that is a fraction of a cent, the amount the Depositary shall
distribute to such record holder shall be rounded to the next highest whole
cent, and upon request of the Depositary, the Company shall pay the additional
amount to the Depositary for distribution.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distributions
Other than Cash, Rights, Preferences or Privileges. Whenever the Depositary
shall receive any distribution other than cash, rights, preferences or
privileges upon the Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.1
and 3.2, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed
pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of the securities or property received
by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective
numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders,
in any manner that the Depositary may deem equitable and practicable for
accomplishing such distribution. If in the opinion of the Depositary such
distribution cannot be made proportionately among such record holders,
or if for any other reason (including any requirement that the Company
or the Depositary withhold an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise
required by law, regulation or court process) the Depositary deems such
distribution not to be feasible, the Depositary may adopt such method as
it deems equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution,
including the sale (at public or private sale) of the securities or property
thus received, or any part thereof, at such place or places and upon such
terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject
to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed or made available for distribution,
as the case may be, by the Depositary to record holders of Receipts as
provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subscription
Rights, Preferences or Privileges. If the Company shall at any time offer
or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names Stock is recorded
on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe
for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges
of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each
such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders
of Receipts in such manner as the Depositary may determine, either by the
issuance to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences
or privileges or by such other method as may be approved by the Depositary
in its discretion with the approval of the Company; provided that, (i)
if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges
the Depositary determines that it is not lawful or (after consultation
with the Company) not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges
available to holders of Receipts by the issue of warrants or otherwise
or (ii) if and to the extent so instructed by holders of Receipts who do
not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, then the
Depositary, in its discretion (with approval of the Company, if the Depositary
has determined that it is not feasible to make such rights, preferences
or privileges available), may, if applicable laws or the terms of such
rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences
or privileges at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon
such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall,
subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed by the Depositary to the
record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.1
in the case of a distribution received in cash.
<p>If the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate
must be registered under the Securities Act in order to be offered or sold
to holders of Receipts, the Company shall file a registration statement
under the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges
and securities promptly and shall use its best efforts and take all steps
available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective
sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or
privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences
or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders
of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase
any securities unless and until it has received written notice from the
Company that such registration statement has become effective or that the
offer and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration
under the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary
an opinion of counsel to such effect. If any other action under the laws
of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization,
consent or permit is required to permit such rights, preferences or privileges
to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization,
consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights,
preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights,
preferences or privileges.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice of Dividends,
etc.; Fixing Record Date for Holders of Receipts. Whenever any cash dividend
or other cash distribution shall become payable or any distribution other
than cash shall be made, or if rights, preferences or privileges shall
at any time be offered, with respect to the Stock, or whenever the Depositary
shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of Stock are entitled
to vote or of which holders of Stock are entitled to notice, or whenever
the Depositary and the Company shall decide that it is appropriate, the
Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be
the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to or
otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Stock) for determining which
holders of Receipts shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution,
rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof,
or to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting,
or shall be entitled to notice of such meeting or for any other appropriate
reasons.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voting Rights.
Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of Stock are
entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter,
mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice which shall be provided
by the Company that shall contain (i) such information as is contained
in such notice of meeting and (ii) a statement that the holders may, subject
to any applicable restrictions, instruct the Depositary as to the exercise
of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Stock represented by their
respective Depositary Shares (including an express indication that instructions
may be given to the Depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person
designated by the Company) and a brief statement as to the manner in which
such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the holders
of Receipts on the relevant record date, the Depositary shall endeavor
insofar as practicable to cast or cause to be cast, in accordance with
the instructions set forth in such requests, the number of votes in respect
of the Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts
as to which voting instructions are received. The Company hereby agrees
to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary
to enable the Depositary to cast such votes or cause such votes to be cast.
In the absence of instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary
shall not cast any vote (but, at its discretion, may appear at any meeting
with respect to such Stock unless directed to the contrary by the holders
of all the Receipts) in respect of the Stock represented by the Depositary
Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes Affecting
Deposited Securities and Reclassifications, Recapitalizations, etc. Upon
any change in par or stated value or liquidation preference, split-up,
combination or any other reclassification of the Stock, or upon any recapitalization,
reorganization, merger or consolidation affecting the Company or to which
it is a party, the Depositary may in its discretion with the approval of,
and shall upon the instructions of, the Company, and (in either case) in
such manner as the Depositary may deem equitable, (i) make such adjustments
as are certified by the Company in the fraction of an interest represented
by one Depositary Share in one share of Stock as may be necessary fully
to reflect the effects of such change in par or stated value or liquidation
preference, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Stock,
or of such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation, and
(ii) treat any securities that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange
for or upon conversion of or in respect of the Stock as new deposited securities
so received in exchange for or upon conversion or in respect of such Stock.
In any such case the Depositary may in its discretion, with the approval
of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts or may call for
the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts
specifically describing such new deposited securities. Anything to the
contrary herein notwithstanding, holders of Receipts shall have the right
from and after the effective date of any such change in par or stated value
or liquidation preference, split-up, combination or other reclassification
of the Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation
to surrender such Receipts to the Depositary with instructions to convert,
exchange or surrender the Stock represented thereby only into or for, as
the case may be, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities
and property and cash into which the Stock represented by such Receipts
might have been converted or for which such Stock might have been exchanged
or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 4.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delivery of Reports.
The Depositary shall, at the expense of the Company, furnish to holders
of Receipts any reports and communications received from the Company that
are received by the Depositary as the holder of Stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 4.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List of Receipt
Holders. Promptly upon request from time to time by, and at the expense
of, the Company, the Depositary shall furnish to it a list, as of the most
recent practicable date, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary
Shares of all record holders of Receipts. The Company shall be entitled
to receive such list twice annually without charge.

<p>ARTICLE V
<p>THE DEPOSITARY, THE DEPOSITARY'S AGENTS, THE REGISTRAR AND THE COMPANY</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintenance of
Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary; Registrar. Upon
execution of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall maintain at the
Depositary's Office, facilities for the execution and delivery, registration
and registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, and at
the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery,
registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, all in accordance
with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
<p>The Depositary shall keep books at the Depositary's Office for the registration
and registration of transfer of Receipts, which books during normal business
hours shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts, provided
that any such holder requesting to exercise such right shall certify to
the Depositary that such inspection shall be for a proper purpose reasonably
related to such person's interest as an owner of Depositary Shares evidenced
by the Receipts.
<p>The Depositary may close such books, at any time or from time to time,
when deemed necessary or appropriate by it in connection with the performance
of its duties hereunder.
<p>The Depositary may, with the approval of the Company, appoint a Registrar
for registration of the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby.
If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Stock
represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on one or more national
stock exchanges, the Depositary shall appoint a Registrar (acceptable to
the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in
accordance with any requirements of such exchange. Such Registrar (which
may be the Depositary if so permitted by the requirements of any such exchange)
may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Depositary upon
the request or with the approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such
Depositary Shares or such Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges,
the Depositary shall, at the request and at the expense of the Company,
arrange such facilities for the delivery, registration, registration of
transfer, surrender and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares
or such Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulation.
<p>The Depositary may from time to time appoint Depositary's Agents to
act in any respect for the Depositary for the purposes of this Deposit
Agreement and may at any time appoint additional Depositary's Agents and
vary or terminate the appointment of such Depositary's Agents. The Depositary
shall notify the Company of any such action.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prevention of
or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the
Registrar or the Company. Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent
nor the Registrar nor the Company shall incur any liability to any holder
of any Receipt if by reason of any provision of any present or future law,
or regulation thereunder, of the United States of America or of any other
governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's
Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any provision, present or future,
of the Certificate or by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance
beyond the reasonable control of the relevant party, the Depositary, the
Depositary's Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented, delayed
or forbidden from, or subjected to any penalty on account of, doing or
performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide
shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's
Agent, the Registrar or the Company incur liability to any holder of a
Receipt (i) by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid,
in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement
shall provide shall or may be done or performed or (ii) by reason of any
exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this
Deposit Agreement except, in the case of any such exercise or failure to
exercise discretion not caused as aforesaid, if caused by the gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith of the party charged with such exercise
or failure to exercise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obligation of
the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor the Registrar nor
the Company assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability
under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other
than for its gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith in performing
such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement.
<p>Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor the Registrar
nor the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or
defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of the Stock, the
Depositary Shares or the Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in
expense or liability unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense
and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
<p>Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor the Registrar
nor the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by
it in reliance upon the written advice of legal counsel or accountants,
or information from any person presenting Stock for deposit, any holder
of a Receipt or any other person believed by it in good faith to be competent
to give such information. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Registrar
and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon
any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it
to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party
or parties.
<p>The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out
any instruction to vote any of the shares of Stock or for the manner or
effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action
is in good faith. The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar shall be
required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations
shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar.
The Depositary shall indemnify the Company and hold it harmless from any
loss, liability or expense (including the reasonable costs and expenses
of defending itself) actually incurred or suffered arising from acts performed
or omitted by the Depositary, including when such Depositary acts as Registrar,
or the Depositary's Agents in connection with this Agreement directly related
to its or their negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The indemnification
obligations of the Depositary set forth in this Section 5.3 shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and any succession of any Depositary.
<p>The Depositary, its parent, affiliates and subsidiaries, the Depositary's
Agents, and the Registrar may own, buy, sell and deal in any class of securities
of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares
or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company
or its affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to or
otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depositary, its
parent, affiliate or subsidiary or the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar
hereunder. The Depositary may also act as trustee, transfer agent or registrar
of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates.
<p>It is intended that none of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent or
the Registrar, acting as the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the
Registrar, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the
securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities
laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary, any
Depositary's Agent and the Registrar are acting only in a ministerial capacity
as Depositary or Registrar for the Stock.
<p>Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees or agents)
nor any Depositary's Agent nor the Registrar makes any representation or
has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statements
pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities
Act, the Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts (except for its counter-signatures
thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein or as to the
correctness of any statement made therein or herein. The Depositary assumes
no responsibility for the correctness of the description that appears in
the Receipts, which can be taken as a statement of the Company summarizing
certain provisions of this Deposit Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein or in the Receipts, the Depositary makes no warranties
or representations as to the validity, genuineness or sufficiency of any
Stock at any time deposited with the Depositary hereunder or of the Depositary
Shares, as to the validity or sufficiency of this Deposit Agreement, as
to the value of the Depositary Shares or as to any right, title or interest
of the record holders of Receipts in and to the Depositary Shares. The
Depositary shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company
of the Depositary Shares or the Receipts or the proceeds thereof.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resignation and
Removal of the Depositary; Appointment of Successor Depositary. The Depositary
may at any time resign as Depositary hereunder by delivering notice of
its election to do so to the Company, such resignation to take effect upon
the appointment of a successor Depositary and acceptance of such appointment
by such successor as hereinafter provided.
<p>The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by notice of
such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon
the appointment of a successor Depositary and acceptance of such appointment
by such successor as hereinafter provided. If at any time the Depositary
acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Company shall, within
60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as
the case may be, appoint a successor Depositary, which shall be a bank
or trust company having its principal office in the United States of America
and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If no
successor Depositary shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment
within 60 days after delivery of such notice, the resigning or removed
Depositary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
of a successor Depositary. Every successor Depositary shall execute and
deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing
accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Depositary,
without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the
rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes
shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor,
upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company,
shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor
all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign,
transfer and deliver all right, title and interest in the Stock and any
moneys or property held hereunder to such successor and shall deliver to
such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts
and such records, books and other information in its possession relating
thereto. Any successor Depositary shall promptly mail notice of its appointment
to the record holders of Receipts.
<p>Any corporation into or with which the Depositary may be merged, consolidated
or converted shall be the successor of such Depositary without the execution
or filing of any document or any further act, and notice thereof shall
not be required hereunder. Such successor Depositary may authenticate the
Receipts in the name of the predecessor Depositary or in the name of the
successor Depositary.
<p>SECTION 5.5 Corporate Notices and Reports. The Company agrees that it
shall deliver to the Depositary, and the Depositary shall, promptly after
receipt thereof transmit to the record holders of Receipts, in each case
at the addresses recorded in the Depositary's books, copies of all notices
and reports (including without limitation financial statements) required
by law or by the rules of any national securities exchange upon which the
Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts are listed, to be furnished
to the record holders of Receipts or that the Company otherwise determines
to furnish. Such transmission shall be at the Company's expense and the
Company shall provide the Depositary with such number of copies of such
documents as the Depositary may reasonably request.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indemnification
by the Company. The Company shall indemnify the Depositary, any Depositary's
Agent and the Registrar against, and hold each of them harmless from, any
loss, liability or expense (including the reasonable costs and expenses
of defending itself) that may arise out of acts performed or omitted in
connection with this Agreement and the Receipts by the Depositary, any
Registrar or any of their respective agents (including any Depositary's
Agent), except for any liability arising out of negligence, willful misconduct
or bad faith on the respective parts of any such person or persons. The
obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.6 shall survive
termination of this Agreement and any succession of any Depositary or Depositary's
Agent.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charges and Expenses.
The Company shall pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges
arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements provided
for herein. The Company shall pay all charges of the Depositary in connection
with the initial deposit of the Stock and the initial issuance of the Depositary
Shares, all withdrawals of shares of the Stock by owners of Depositary
Shares, and any redemption or exchange of the Stock. All other transfer
and other taxes and governmental charges shall be at the expense of holders
of Depositary Shares. If, at the request of a holder of Receipts, the Depositary
incurs charges or expenses for which it is not otherwise liable hereunder,
such holder shall be liable for such charges and expenses. All other charges
and expenses of the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent hereunder (including,
in each case, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incident to the
performance of their respective obligations hereunder shall be paid upon
prior consultation and agreement between the Depositary and the Company
as to the amount and nature of such charges and expenses. The Depositary
shall present its statement for charges and expenses to the Company at
such intervals as the Company and the Depositary may agree.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 5.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deposit of Stock
by the Company. The Company agrees with the Depositary that neither the
Company nor any company controlled by the Company shall at any time deposit
any Stock if such Stock is required to be registered under the provisions
of the Securities Act and no registration statement is at such time in
effect as to such Stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 5.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tax Compliance.
The Depositary, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Company shall comply
with all applicable certification, information reporting and withholding
(including "backup" withholding) requirements imposed by applicable tax
laws, regulations or administrative practice with respect to (i) any payments
made with respect to the Depositary Shares or (ii) the issuance, delivery,
holding, transfer, redemption or exercise of rights under the Receipts
or the Depositary Shares. Such compliance shall include, without limitation,
the preparation and timely filing of required returns and the timely payment
of all amounts required to be withheld to the appropriate taxing authority
or its designated agent. The Company shall fully cooperate with the Depositary
in fulfilling any and all duties set forth in this Section 5.9.
<p>The Depositary shall comply with directions received from the Company
with respect to the application of such requirements to particular payments
or holders or in other particular circumstances and may for purposes of
this Agreement rely on any such direction in accordance with the provisions
of Section 5.3 hereof.
<p>The Depositary shall maintain all appropriate records documenting compliance
with such requirements and shall make such records available on request
to the Company or to its authorized representatives.

<p>ARTICLE VI
<p>AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendment. The
form of the Receipts and any provisions of this Deposit Agreement may at
any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the Company
and the Depositary in any respect that they may deem necessary or desirable,
provided that no such amendment (other than any change in the fees of any
Depositary or Registrar, which shall not go into effect sooner than 30
days after notice thereof to the holders of the Receipts) that materially
and adversely alters the rights of the holders of Receipts shall become
effective unless such amendment is approved by the holders of at least
a majority of the Depositary Shares then outstanding. Every holder of an
outstanding Receipt at the time any such amendment becomes effective shall
be deemed, by continuing to hold such Receipt, to consent and agree to
such amendment and to be bound by the Deposit Agreement as amended thereby.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termination.
This Agreement may be terminated by the Company or the Depositary only

SECTION 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Recapitalization.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Pursuant
to Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
("Delaware Law"), as soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions set forth in Article
VIII, the Company will file an amended and restated certificate of incorporation
in form and substance as set forth on Schedule 1.1 (the "Restated Certificate")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the "Recapitalization") shall become effective at such time as the Restated
Certificate is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
or at such later time as may be mutually agreed upon by the Company and
each of the Unions and as is specified in the Restated Certificate (the
"Effective Time").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>SECTION 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Reclassification of Old Shares.</i></dir>
(a) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 1.5(f), each share of common
stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including each share of vested
and unvested restricted stock issued pursuant to the UAL 1988 Restricted
Stock Plan, together with each share of Common Stock held by the Company
as treasury stock or owned by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
which is not cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to Section 1.2(b) (each of the foregoing being referred to herein as an
"Old Share"), shall, without any further action on the part of the holder
thereof, be reclassified (the "Reclassification") as, and converted into:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>(i) 0.5 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the "New Shares") having the rights, powers and privileges
described in the Restated Certificate; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(ii) one one-thousandth of a share of Series D Redeemable Preferred
Stock of the Company, without par value (the "Redeemable Preferred Stock"),
having the rights, powers and privileges described in the Restated Certificate.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
If the Underwriting Alternative (as defined in Section 1.11 hereof) has
been elected and consummated with respect to the Depositary Shares (as
defined), the Series A Debentures (as defined) and/or the Series B Debentures
(as defined), the terms of the Redeemable Preferred Stock will be modified
as provided in the Restated Certificate.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) Each Old Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by
any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Treasury Shares"), up to a maximum of 1,000,000 Treasury Shares
(the "Retained Treasury Shares"), shall be reclassified and converted in
accordance with Section 1.2(a), with all Treasury Shares in excess of 1,000,000
being surrendered for cancellation immediately prior to the Effective Time
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Immediately following
the Effective Time, the Company and each of its wholly owned Subsidiaries
(as defined in Section 3.6) shall surrender for cancellation the Redeemable
Preferred Stock received upon Reclassification of the Retained Treasury
Shares and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Following the
Effective Time, all outstanding shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock shall,
to the extent of funds legally available therefor and subject to the provisions
of the Restated Certificate, be redeemed immediately after issuance according
to the terms thereof (the "Redemption"). Pursuant to the Redemption, the
holders of Redeemable Preferred Stock, if any, shall be entitled to receive,
in respect of each one one-thousandth of a share of Redeemable Preferred
Stock, subject to the terms thereof and Section 1.5(f):
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(i) $25.80 in cash;</dir>
(ii) either (a) depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares") representing
interests in $31.10 liquidation preference of Series B Preferred Stock
of the Company, without par value (the "Public Preferred Stock"), or (b)
if the Underwriting Alternative with respect to the Depositary Shares is
consummated, a cash payment equal to the Depositary Share Proceeds Amount
(as defined);
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(iii) either (a) $15.55 principal amount of Series A Senior Unsecured
Debentures due 2004 of United issued as provided below (the "Series A Debentures")

Amount (as defined); and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(iv) either (a) $15.55 principal amount of Series B Senior Unsecured
Debentures due 2014 of United issued as provided below (the "Series B Debentures"
and, together with the Series A Debentures, collectively, the "Debentures")
or (b) if the Underwriting Alternative with respect to the Series B Debentures
is consummated, a cash payment equal to the Series B Debenture Proceeds
Amount (as defined).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
The Depositary Shares shall be issued pursuant to a Deposit Agreement substantially
in the form set forth on Schedule 1.3(a) (the "Deposit Agreement"). The
Depositary Shares shall be issued only in denominations of $25.00 of liquidation
preference and integral multiples thereof. The Public Preferred Stock shall
have the rights, powers and privileges described in the Restated Certificate,
which shall include a per share liquidation preference of $25,000. The
Debentures shall be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of July
1, 1991, between United arid the Bank of New York, and the Officers' Certificate
(the "Officers' Certificate") in form and substance as set forth on Schedule
1.3(b) (collectively, the "Indenture"). Such Indenture shall be qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "TIA"). The Debentures shall be issued only in denominations
of $100 and integral multiples thereof or, if the Underwriting Alternative
with respect to either series of Debentures is consummated at or prior
to the Effective Time and the Company so elects, denominations of $1,000
and integral multiple thereof, in which case conforming changes shall be
made to this Agreement and the attachments hereto to take into account
such greater denominations with respect to such series.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>SECTION 1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Pricing of Specified Securities.</i></dir>
(a) The parties have agreed that the respective interest and dividend rates
that would be required to be applied to the Debentures and the Public Preferred
Stock, respectively, in order for the Debentures and the Depositary Shares
to trade at 100% of aggregate principal amount (in the case of the Debentures)
or at 100% of aggregate liquidation preference (in the case of the Depositary
Shares) (collectively "par")<b> </b>as of the close of business, New York
time, on the Trading Day (as defined below) immediately preceding<b> </b>the
date hereof (assuming for such purpose that the Debentures and the Depositary
Shares were fully distributed on such date) would be as follows (the "Initial
Pricing"): Series A Dentures--9.00%, Series B Debentures,--9.70% and Public
Preferred Stock-10.25%. Each of the Series A Debentures, the Series B Debentures
and the Public Preferred Stock is referred to herein as a "Specified Security"
and, collectively, as the "Specified Securities."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) On the Trading Day immediately preceding the Announcement Date,
CS First Boston Corporation ("First Boston") (in consultation with Lazard
Freres &amp; Co. ("hazard")) on behalf of the Company and Keilin &amp;
Bloom (or such other investment banking firm as may be reasonably selected
by the Unions) on behalf of the Unions (the "Primary Banking Firms") shall
seek to mutually determine the interest or dividend rates, as applicable
(the "Applicable Rate"), that each of the Specified Securities should bear
in order for such Specified Security (in the case of the Debentures) or
the Depositary Shares (in the case of the Public Preferred Stock) to trade
at par as of the close of business, New York time, on the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Announcement Date, assuming both that an Underwriting Alternative
with respect thereto had and had not been elected and further assuming
in each such case that such Specified Security or Depositary Shares, as
the case may be, were fully distributed on such Trading Day. If the Primary
Banking Firms agree on the Applicable Rate with respect to a Specified
Security, such Specified Security shall bear such rate and such rate shall
be the Applicable Rate with respect to such Specified Security. If the
Primary Banking Firms are unable to agree on the Applicable Rate with respect
to a Specified Security, then (i) Salomon Brothers Inc, or such other firm
as agreed in writing by the Primary Banking Firms (the "Deadlock Firm"),
shall render its opinion, on the Trading Day immediately preceding the
Announcement Date, as to the Applicable Rate with respect to such Specified
Security or Securities, and (ii) the Applicable Rate with respect to such
Specified Security or Securities shall be the average of the two closest
rates specified in the opinions of the Primary Banking Firms and the Deadlock
Firm, rounded to the nearest one one-hundredth of a percent in the case
of the interest rate for the Debentures and to the nearest one one-hundredth
of a percent in the case of the dividend rate for the Public Preferred
Stock; provided however, that, in no event shall the Applicable Rate with
respect to the Specified Securities exceed (x) in the case of the Series
A Debentures, 10.125%; (y) in the case of the Series B Debentures, 10.825%;
and (z) in the case of the Public Preferred Stock, 11.375% (the "Maximum
Pricing").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) On the Announcement Date, the Company shall issue a press release
setting forth the Applicable Rate for each of the Specified Securities,
which press release shall be distributed to major wire services and news
agencies, and shall confirm that the Company Stockholder Meeting (as defined
in Section 5.2) will be held as scheduled, and shall contain such other
information as may be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Unions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(d) "Announcement Date" shall mean a Trading Day which shall be not
fewer than five calendar days nor greater than ten calendar days preceding
the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, such date to be disclosed
to the Unions not fewer than ten calendar days prior thereto. "Trading
Day" shall mean a day on which the New York Stock Exchange. Inc. ("NYSE")
is open for the transaction of business.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(e) The parties agree that the Initial Pricing of the Debentures (and
the Maximum Pricing for the Debentures) was based on, and the Applicable
Rates will be based on, the assumption that the Debentures will not be
callable prior to their respective stated maturities. The parties further
agree that the Unions may request, not less than seven days prior to the
Announcement Date, that, in the event that the Underwriting Alternative
is not consummated with respect to either or both series of Debentures,
either or both of the series of Debentures shall be callable prior to stated
maturity. If so requested, immediately following the establishment of the
Applicable Rates and prior to the Announcement Date, an additional procedure
(based on the procedure set forth in Section 1.4(b)) shall be implemented
whereby the Primary Banking Firms shall establish the incremental increase
in pricing resulting from the addition of the call feature on either or
both of the series of Debentures, as the case may be, above the Applicable
Rate, with any disagreement to be resolved in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 1.4(b) involving the Deadlock Firm; provided however,
that the Unions may withdraw the request for a call feature at any time
up to the issuance of the press release in accordance with subsection 1.4(c).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the Schedules
or Exhibits hereto to the contrary, if the Underwriting Alternative with
respect to the Depositary Shares or either series of Debentures is consummated,
(i) with respect to the securities that are subject to the Underwriting
Alternative, the Company and United, in consultation with the underwriters,
may set the record dates and payment dates (quarterly and semiannually,
respectively) for the Public Preferred Stock (to which the Depositary Shares
relate) and the Debentures, may select a regular interest payment date
in the year 2004 as the maturity date for the Series A Debentures and may
set a regular interest payment date in the year 2014 as the maturity date
for the Series B Debentures and (ii) the following provisions of this subsection
1.4(f), with respect to the securities that are subject to the Underwriting
Alternative, shall be null and void. If the Company causes a regular quarterly
dividend to be paid on both the Public Preferred Stock and the Prior Preferred
Stock (as defined below) in respect of any regular quarterly dividend payment
date, then the Company shall cause the quarterly record date (and corresponding
dividend payment date) for the payment of such dividend on the Public Preferred
Stock to be the same as the quarterly record date (and corresponding dividend
payment date) for the payment of such dividend on the Series A 6.25% Convertible
Preferred Stock of the Company (the "Prior Preferred Stock"). With respect
to a regular quarterly dividend payment date for the Public Preferred Stock
and the Prior Preferred Stock that coincides with a regular semi-annual
interest payment date for the Debentures, if the Company causes (i) a regular
quarterly dividend to be paid on the Public Preferred Stock or the Prior
Preferred Stock, or both, in respect of any such quarterly dividend payment
date and (ii) a regular semi-annual installment of interest to be paid
on the Debentures in respect of such regular semi-annual interest payment
date, then the Company shall cause the semi-annual record date (and corresponding
interest payment date) for such payment of interest on the Debentures to
be the same as the quarterly record date (and corresponding dividend payment
date) for the payment of such dividend on the Public Preferred Stock or
the Prior Preferred Stock or both, as the case may be.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>SECTION 1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Surrender and Exchange.</i></dir>
(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall enter into an agreement
(the "Exchange Agent Agreement") with First Chicago Trust Company of New
York, as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the purpose of exchanging
certificates representing Old Shares for the Recapitalization Consideration
(defined below). The Company will make available to the Exchange Agent,
as needed, in trust for the benefit of holders of Old Shares, the Recapitalization
Consideration (as defined herein) to be distributed in respect of the Old
Shares (without regard to Section 1.5(f)). The cash portion of the Recapitalization
Consideration shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by the
Company (so long as such directions do not impair the rights of holders
of Old Shares), in direct obligations of the United States, obligations
for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest, commercial paper rated
of the highest quality by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard
&amp; Poor's Corporation or certificates of deposit issued by a commercial
bank having at least $10,000,000,000 in assets (collectively, "Permitted
Securities"), and any net earnings with respect thereto shall be paid to
the Company. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
make the distributions referred to in Section 1.5(b) and the Recapitalization
Consideration held by the Exchange Agent shall not be used for any other
purpose. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Company will
send, or cause the Exchange Agent to send and otherwise make available,
to each holder of Old Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal,
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Unions and the Company, for use
in such exchange. Such letter of transmittal shall advise such holder of
the effectiveness of the Recapitalization, whether or not any portion of
the Underwriting Alternative has been consummated and, if consummated,
the expected amount of the Proceeds Amount, and the procedures for surrendering
to the Exchange Agent certificates representing Old Shares for exchange
into Recapitalization Consideration and shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and the risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the certificates representing Old Shares to the Exchange
Agent.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) Each holder of Old Shares that have been converted into New Shares
and Redeemable Preferred Stock, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
an Old Certificate or Certificates, together with a properly completed
letter of transmittal covering such Old Shares, will be entitled to receive
in respect of such Old Shares, subject to Section 1.5(f):
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>(i) a certificate or certificates representing 0.5 of a New Share
for each Old Share formerly represented by such Old Certificate or Certificates
in accordance with Section 1.2;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(ii) either (a) a depositary receipt or receipts representing Depositary
Shares representing interests in $31.10 liquidation preference of Public
Preferred Stock for each Old Share formerly represented by such Old Certificate
or Certificates in respect of the Redemption or (b) if the Underwriting
Alternative with respect to the Depositary Shares is consummated, a cash
payment equal to the Depositary Share Proceeds Amount in respect of the
Redemption;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(iii) either (a) $15.55 principal amount of Series A Debentures for
each Old Share formerly represented by such Old Certificate or Certificates
in respect of the Redemption or (b) if the Underwriting Alternative with
respect to the Series A Debentures is consummated, a cash payment equal
to the Series A Debenture Proceeds Amount in respect of the Redemption;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(iv) either (a) $15.55 principal amount of Series B Debentures for each
Old Share formerly represented by such Old Certificate or Certificates
in respect of the Redemption or (b) if the Underwriting Alternative with
respect to the Series B Debentures is consummated, a cash payment equal
to the Series B Debenture Proceeds Amount in respect of the Redemption;
and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(v) a cash payment of $25.80 for each Old Share formerly represented
by such Old Certificate or Certificates in respect of the Redemption (the
cash and/or securities distributed pursuant to clauses (i) through (v),
collectively, the "Recapitalization Consideration").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
Until so surrendered, each Old Certificate or Certificates formerly representing
Old Shares shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive such Recapitalization Consideration.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) If any portion of the Recapitalization Consideration is to be paid
to a person other than the registered holder of the Old Shares formerly
represented by the Old Certificate or Certificates so surrendered in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Old Certificate
or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be iii proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as
a result of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of
such Old Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(d) In the event any Old Certificate or Certificates shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit to that fact
by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Company will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate or Certificates the Recapitalization Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof in accordance with this Article I. When authorizing
such issue of the Recapitalization Consideration in exchange therefor,
the Company may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance there, require the person claiming ownership of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Old Certificate or Certificates to give the Company a bond
in such sum as it may direct, or otherwise indemnify the Company in a manner
satisfactory to it, against any claim that may be made against the Company
with respect to the Old Certificate or Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Old Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificate
or Certificates are presented to the Company or its transfer agent, such
Old Certificate or Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Recapitalization Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article I. All Recapitalization Consideration
to be distributed pursuant to this Section 1.5, if unclaimed on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, shall be released and paid by the Exchange
Agent to the Company, after which time persons entitled thereto may look,
subject to applicable escheat and other similar laws, only to the Company
for payment thereof.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>(i) No certificates, debentures or scrip representing fractional New
Shares, depositary receipts representing fractional Depositary Shares (based
upon each whole Depositary Share representing interests in $25 liquidation
preference of Public Preferred Stock) or fractional Debentures shall be
issued as part of the Recapitalization, and such fractional interests will
not entitle the beneficial or record owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder
or creditor of the Company.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the number of whole New Shares
into which all of the Old Shares will be reclassified and converted pursuant
to Section 1.2 over (y) the aggregate number of whole New Shares to be
distributed to holders of Old Shares pursuant to Section 1.5 (such excess
being referred to herein as the "Excess New Shares"); and if the Underwriting
Alternative has not been elected with respect to the Depositary Shares,
the Series A Debentures and/or the Series B Debentures, as the case may
be, or, if elected has not been consummated for any reason at or prior
to the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall also determine, as appropriate,
(I) the excess of (a) the number of whole Depositary Shares representing
interests in shares of Public Preferred Stock issuable upon Redemption
in accordance with Article FOURTH, Part I.D, Section 6 of the Restated
Certificate with respect to the Redeemable Preferred Stock into which the
Old Shares will be reclassified and converted pursuant to Section 1.2(a)
over (b) the aggregate number of whole Depositary Shares representing interests
in shares of Public Preferred Stock to be distributed to holders of Old
Shares pursuant to Section 1.5 (such excess being referred to herein as
the "Excess Depositary Shares"); (II) the excess of (a) the number of whole
Series A Debentures issuable upon Redemption in accordance with Article
FOURTH, Part I.D, Section 6 of the Restated Certificate with respect to
the Redeemable Preferred Stock into which the Old Shares will be reclassified
and converted pursuant to Section 1.2(a) over (b) the aggregate number
of whole Series A Debentures to be distributed to holders of Old Shares
pursuant to Section 1.5 (such excess being referred to herein as the "Excess
Series A Debentures"); and/or (III) the excess of (a) the number of whole
Series B Debentures issuable upon Redemption in accordance with Article
FOURTH, Part I.D, Section 6 of the Restated Certificate with respect to
the Redeemable Preferred Stock into which the Old Shares will be reclassified
and converted pursuant to Section 1.2(a) over (b) the aggregate number
of whole Series B Debentures to be distributed to holders of Old Shares
pursuant to Section 1.5 (such excess being referred to herein as the "Excess
Series B Debentures" and, together with the Excess New Shares, the Excess
Depositary Shares and/or the Excess Series A Debentures, as applicable,
collectively, the "Excess Securities"). As soon after the Effective Time
as practicable taking into account market conditions based on consultations
with the Company, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Old Shares,
shall sell the Excess Securities at then prevailing prices on the principal
national securities exchange, automated quotation system or other trading
market (the "Applicable Exchange") on which the relevant Excess Securities
are listed or admitted for trading (which shall be the NYSE in the case
of the New Shares), all in the manner provided in paragraph (iii) of this
Section.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(iii) The sale of the Excess Securities by the Exchange Agent shall
be executed on an Applicable Exchange through one or more member firms
of such Applicable Exchange and shall be executed in round lots to the
extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Old Shares, the Exchange Agent will hold
such proceeds in trust for the holders of Old Shares (the "Excess Securities
Trust"). Until distributed as provided below, the Excess Securities Trust
shall be invested, as directed by the Company, in Permitted Securities
and any net earnings with respect thereto shall be paid to the Company.
The Company shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange
Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Securities.
The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Excess Securities
Trust to which each holder of Old Shares shall be entitled, if any, by
(w) multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the
Excess Securities Trust attributable to the sale of Excess New Shares by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional New
Share interest to which such holder of Old Shares would be entitled but
for the application of Section 1.5(f)(i) and the denominator of which is
the aggregate amount of fractional New Share interests to which all holders
of Old Shares would be entitled but for the application of Section 1.5(f)(i);
and if the Underwriting Alternative has not been elected with respect to
the Depositary Shares, the Series A Debentures and/or the Series B Debentures,
as the case may be, or, if elected has not been consummated for any reason
at or prior to the Effective Time, as appropriate, by (x) multiplying the
amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Excess Securities Trust
attributable to the sale of Excess Depositary Shares by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional Depositary Share interest
to which such holder of Old Shares would be entitled but for the application
of Section 1.5(t)(i) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount
of fractional Depositary Share interests to which all holders of Old Shares
would be entitled but for the application of Section 1.5(f)(i); (y) multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Excess Securities
Trust attributable to the sale of Excess Series A Debentures by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional Series A Debenture
interest to which such holder of Old Shares would be entitled but for the
application of Section 1.5(f)(i) and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of fractional Series A Debenture interests to which all holders
of Old Shares would be entitled but for the application of Section 1.5(f)(i);
and (z) multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising
the Excess Securities Trust attributable to the sale of Excess Series B
Debentures by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
Series B Debenture interest to which such holder of Old Shares would be
entitled but for the application of Section 1.5(f)(i) and the denominator
of which is the aggregate amount of fractional Series B Debenture interests
to which all holders of Old Shares would be entitled but for the application
of Section 1.5(f)(i).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the total amount
of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Old Shares in lieu of any fractional
New Share and, if applicable, Depositary Share interests, Series A Debenture
interests and/or Series B Debenture interests, the Exchange Agent shall
make available such amounts to such holders of Old Shares; provided, however,
that such amounts shall be paid to each holder of Old Shares only upon
surrender of such holder's Old Certificate or Certificates together with
a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and any other
required documents. All cash in lieu of fractional interests to be paid
pursuant to this Section 1.5(f), if unclaimed on the first anniversary
of the Effective Time, shall be released and paid by the Exchange Agent
to the Company, after which time persons entitled thereto may look, subject
to applicable escheat and other similar laws, only to the Company for payment
thereof.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
(g) No interest shall be paid or accrued on any portion of the Recapitalization
Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect
to New Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate or Certificates with
respect to the New Shares such holder is entitled to receive until the
holder of such Old Certificate or Certificates shall surrender the same
in accordance with this Section 1.5 and unless such holder is a record
holder of such New Shares on such record date.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>Section 1.6<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Issuances.</i></dir>
In conjunction with the consummation of the Recapitalization, the Company
shall issue the shares described in this Section 1.6.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) During the 69 months following the Effective Time, the "Final Number"
(as defined in subsection (b)) of shares of convertible preferred stock
described below (the "ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock") shall be (i) issued
to State Street Bank and Trust Company, a Massachusetts business trust,
as trustee (the "ESQP Trustee") under a trust to be created pursuant to
the Employee Stock Ownership Trust Agreement between the Company and the
ESOP Trustee in form and substance as set forth on Schedule 1.6(a) (i)
(the "ESOP Trust") and to be established for the benefit of certain employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries participating in the UAL Corporation
Employee Stock Ownership Plan in form and substance as set forth on Schedule
1.6(a) (ii) (the "ESOP") and, to the extent not so issued, (ii) credited
as book entry credits to the accounts of certain employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries participating in the UAL Corporation Supplemental
ESOP in form and substance as set forth on Schedule 1.6(a) (iii) (the "Supplemental
ESOP" and together with the ESOP, collectively, the "ESOPs") and in certain
circumstances issued to the ESOP Trustee under a trust (the "Supplemental
ESOP Trust" and together with the ESOP Trust, collectively, the "ESOP Trusts")
to be created pursuant to the Supplemental ESOP Trust Agreement between
the Company and the ESOP Trustee in form and substance as set forth on
Schedule 1.6(a)(iv).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) The number of shares of ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock to be so
issued and credited as contemplated by subsection (a) shall initially be
17,675,345, which is equal to the product of (i) 0.5, (ii) 55/45ths, (iii)
the "Fully Diluted Old Shares" immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (iv) 0.9999. The "Fully Diluted Old Shares" immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall equal 28,926,185. The total number of shares of ESOP
Convertible Preferred Stock to be so issued and credited is subject to
increase (in accordance with Section 1.10) up to an amount equal to the
sum of (i) 17,675,345 plus (ii) the Additional Shares (as defined in Section
1.10). Such total number of shares, including to the extent, if any, so
increased, is referred to as the "Final Number."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) The ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock shall consist of (i) Class
1 ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company,
with a fixed dollar dividend in a dollar amount (the "Dollar Amount") that
is equal to 7.00%, or such lesser percentage that may be agreed to by the
Company and the ESOP Trustee prior to the Effective Time, of the per share
price at which the Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock is issued to the ESOP Trustee
at the Effective Time (the "Initial Price"), and having the rights, powers
and privileges set forth in the Restated Certificate (the "ESOP Preferred"),
and (ii) Class 2 ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company having the rights, powers and privileges set forth
in the Restated Certificate (the "Supplemental ESOP Preferred").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(d) At the Effective Time, the Company shall issue to the ESOP Trustee
in accordance with a stock purchase agreement and amendment in form and
substance as.set forth on Schedule 1.6(d) (as so amended, the "ESOP Stock
Purchase Agreement"), a number of shares of ESOP Preferred (the "Initial
Shares") equal to the Year 1 Release Shares (as defined), divided by the
Year 1 Decimal (as defined).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(i) The term "Year 1 Release Shares" shall mean the product of
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>(x) 17,675,345,</dir>
(y) a fraction (the "First Year Fraction") having a numerator equal to
the number of days from the Effective Time to December 31, 1994 and a denominator
equal to 2,099 (which approximates the number of days in the 69 months
after the Effective Time), and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(z) 0.7815 (the "Class 1 Decimal").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(ii) The term "Year 1 Decimal" shall mean one minus the product of
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>(xx) the Dollar Amount as a percentage (expressed as a decimal) of
the Initial Price and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(yy) 5.25.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
The Year 1 Release Shares shall be released from the ESOP suspense account
and allocated to the accounts of ESOP participants as of December 31, 1994.
The balance of the Initial Shares (the "Year 1 Remaining Shares") shall
be released from the ESOP suspense account and allocated to the accounts
of ESOP participants in level installments for each full plan year (and
prorated for the quarter ending March 31, 2000) in the period from January
1, 1995 through March 31, 2000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>As of December 31, 1994, there shall be credited to the accounts of
Supplemental ESOP participants a number of shares of Supplemental ESOP
Preferred equal to the product of
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(aa) 17,675,345,
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(bb) the First Year Fraction, and
<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
(e) At or about the 365th day following the Effective Time (the "Measuring
Date") and at or about the next four following anniversaries of the Measuring
Date (each a "Measuring Date Anniversary"), the Company shall negotiate
in good faith with the ESOP Trustee to reach an agreement under which the
Company shall issue to the ESOP Trustee shares of ESOP Preferred at an
agreed-upon price per share (for each applicable plan year, the "Purchase
Price"). If such agreement is reached within 30 days of the Measuring Date
or within 30 days of any Measuring Date Anniversary, then, within five
days thereafter, the Company shall sell to the ESOP Trustee, and the ESOP
Trustee shall purchase from the Company, pursuant to an agreement substantially
in the form of Exhibit B to the ESOP Stock Purchase Agreement, a number
of shares of ESOP Preferred (with respect to each such year, the "Subsequent
Shares"), which number of shares shall equal, for each such plan year,
the Subsequent Year Release Shares (as defined) divided by the Subsequent
Year Decimal (as defined).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(i) The term "Subsequent Year Release Shares" shall mean, for each
such plan year, the excess of
<br>&nbsp;

</dir>
(yy) the number of Year I Remaining Shares and Subsequent Year Remaining
Shares (as defined below) (collectively, "Tail Shares") scheduled to be
released in such plan year.</dir>
(ii) The term "Subsequent Year Decimal" shall be calculated separately
for each such plan year and shall mean one minus the product of
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;
<p>(zz) the number of years and fractional years from the end of the plan
year for which such shares are being issued to March 31, 2000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
The Subsequent Year Release Shares for each such plan year shall be released
from the ESOP suspense account and allocated to the accounts of ESOP participants
as of the end of such plan year. The balance of the Subsequent Shares for
such plan year (the "Subsequent Year Remaining Shares") shall be released
from the ESOP suspense account and allocated to the accounts of ESOP participants
in level installments for each full plan year (and prorated for the quarter
ending March 31, 2000) remaining in the period from the January 1 immediately
following such plan year through March 31, 2000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>For each of the second through sixth plan years of the Supplemental
ESOP, there shall be credited to the accounts of Supplemental ESOP participants
shares of Supplemental ESOP Preferred equal to the product of (aa) tz/69ths
of the Final Number and (bb) the decimal equal to one minus the Class 1

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(f) Commencing not later than December 1, 1999, the Company shall negotiate
in good faith with the ESOP Trustee to reach an agreement under which the
Company shall issue to the ESOP Trustee shares of ESOP Preferred at an
agreed.upon price (the "Purchase Price" for such year). If such agreement
is reached, then on the first business day in the year 2000, the Company
shall sell to the ESOP Trustee, and the ESOP Trustee shall purchase from
the Company, pursuant to an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit
B to the ESOP Stock Purchase Agreement, a number of shares of ESOP Preferred
("Final Year Shares"), which number shall equal the excess of
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(A) the product of
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(xx) the Final Number,</dir>
</dir>
(yy) a fraction (the "Final Fraction") equal to one minus the sum of 20/23rds
and the First Year Fraction, and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(zz) the Class 1 Decimal, over</dir>
</dir>
(B) the number of Tail Shares scheduled to be released in such plan year.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For the seventh plan year of the Supplemental ESOP, there shall be credited
to the accounts of Supplemental ESOP participants shares of Supplemental
ESOP Preferred equal; to the product of (aa) the Final Number, (bb) the
Final Fraction and (cc) a decimal equal to one minus the Class 1 Decimal.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(g) The Company may, with the consent of the Unions, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, make all or any part of the sales of ESOP Preferred
to the ESOP Trustee described above at any earlier date or dates, provided
that the timing and amount of the release of such shares to the accounts
of employees in the ESOPs contemplated by subsections (d), (e) and (f)
above shall not be altered by the different date or dates of the sales.
If any sale of Subsequent Shares or Final Year Shares is not consummated
in accordance with subsection (e) or (f) above (if not earlier consummated
pursuant to this subsection (g)), a number of shares of Supplemental ESOP
Preferred as is equal to the number of shares of ESOP Preferred not so
sold shall be contributed to the ESOP (Part B) or credited to the accounts
of participants in the Supplemental ESOP, as applicable. Such contribution
or crediting shall be at such time or times such that the release (or crediting)
of shares to the accounts of employees contemplated by subsections (d),
(e) and (f) above shall not be altered. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein (other than the provisions of this subsection (g) relating
to "catch-up" dividends), the aggregate number of shares of ESOP Convertible
Preferred Stock issued, credited, or contributed under this Section 1.6
and Section 1.10 shall not exceed, or be less than, the Final Shares. In
the event that fixed dividends on the ESOP Preferred attributable to a
particular acquisition loan are not paid when initially due because the
Company lacks sufficient earnings and profits, and such earnings and profits
later become available, it is possible that such dividends (the "skipped
dividends") may then be paid on a catch-up basis, to the ESOP Trustee at
a time when such catch-up dividends (when added to other fixed dividends
payable on shares attributable to such loan) exceed the principal and interest
then payable on the loan to which such dividends relate. In that event,
compliance with the rules applicable to the ESOP may require a portion
of such catch-up dividends to be used to purchase New Shares rather than
pay principal or interest on such acquisition loan. If such purchase causes
the New Shares and ESOP Preferred allocated to participants in that year
to exceed the number of shares that would have been allocable absent payment
of the catch-up dividend, then, notwithstanding the provisions of Section
1.6, the parties agree that they shall negotiate in good faith to determine
whether there is a manner in which the ESOP and the Supplemental ESOP can
be amended so that, in subsequent years, allocations to participants can
be reduced in a manner that results in participants achieving the same
economic position that would have resulted if no such skipped dividends
had occurred; and if the result described in the preceding clause of this
sentence can be achieved without material detriment to any participant
(in relation to the econonuc position such participant would have enjoyed
had the skipped dividend not occurred) and without interference with the
general objectives of the ESOP program, then the Company may, with the
consent of the Unions as to the satisfaction of the standards set forth
in this sentence, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, adopt appropriate
amendments to this Agreement, the ESOP and Supplemental ESOP to effectuate
the intent of this sentence. Achievement of the goal described in the preceding
sentence may require issuance of fewer shares of ESOP Convertible Preferred
Stock in future periods than would have otherwise been the case (because
of the ESOP's unexpected early acquisition of New Shares). All disputes
concerning whether the Unions reasonably withheld a consent in accordance
with the provisions of this subsection (g) shall be resolved in accordance
with the arbitration procedures described in Section 11.2(b)(ii)(G)-(J)
of the ESOP.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(h) In consideration of each issuance by the Company of the shares of
ESOP Preferred to the ESOP Trust, the ESOP Trustee, on behalf of the ESOP
Trust, shall (y) pay to the Company an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
par value of the shares of ESOP Preferred so issued and (z) execute and
deliver a promissory note, in the aggregate principal amount equal to the
aggregate ,.purchase price for the ESOP Preferred so issued less the amount
paid pursuant to clause (y), in substantially the form set forth on Exhibit
A to the ESOP Stock Purchase Agreement (each, an "ESOP Note").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>(i) In addition, the Company shall also issue and contribute to the
ESOP Trust at the Effective Time:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>(q) If, due to limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code
or due to the issuance of Additional Shares, the respective Employee Groups
(as defined in the ESOP) are prevented from reasonably achieving the contemplated
allocations among and within their respective Employee Groups, the parties
agree to cooperate to modify the Class 1 Decimal with respect to sales
contemplated by Section 1.6(e) and Section 1.6(t) and to make appropriate

the Effective Time, shall (i) if provided by the terms thereof (or if accelerated
in accordance with the relevant plan) become fully vested and exercisable

in exchange for the aggregate exercise price for such Option, without interest,
the Recapitalization Consideration with respect to each Old Share that
such holder would have been entitled to receive had such holder exercised
such Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Recapitalization
Consideration issuable upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the

<p>SECTION 1.11 <i>Underwriting Alternative. </i>Prior to the date that

seven days prior to the Announcement Date, the Company may elect to pursue
the underwriting of (a) the Depositary Shares, (b) the Series A Debentures,
(c) the Series B Debentures, or (d) any combination of the foregoing (referred
to collectively herein as the "Underwriting Alternative"), provided that
consummating an underwriting with respect to the Depositary Shares and/or
either or both series of Debentures, as the case may be, shall be in lieu
of issuing Depositary Shares or either or both such series of Debentures
to holders ef Old Shares pursuant to Section 1.5 hereof, to holders of
Options pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof and to holders of Convertible Company
Securities pursuant to Section 1.8 hereof. If the Company elects the Underwriting
Alternative, it may offer pursuant thereto approximately the amounts of
Depositary Shares and/or Debentures which if the Underwriting Alternative
were not elected would be issuable upon the exchange of all outstanding
Old Shares in the Reclassification and upon exercise of Options and conversion
of the Convertible Company Securities reasonably expected to be exchanged
or converted in accordance with Sections 1.7 and 1.8 hereof (at the rate
of $31.10 liquidation preference of Public Preferred Stock as represented
by Depositary Shares, $15.55 principal amount of Series A Debentures and
$15.55 principal amount of Series B Debentures per Old Share), which amounts
shall be rounded up to produce aggregate amounts of Depositary Shares and
Debentures of each series that are consistent with customary aggregate
underwriting denominations. If it so elects to pursue the Underwriting
Alternative, the Company shall use its best efforts to accomplish such
underwritings, including selecting a managing underwriter or underwriters,
filing registration statements with the SEC, and entering into a firm commitment
underwriting agreement or agreements, <i>provided, however, </i>that the
Company may elect to terminate the Underwriting Alternative at any time
prior to the Effective Time. The Unions will cooperate and use their best
efforts to facilitate the underwritings. The Underwriting Alternative will
be effected in accordance with customary underwriting agreements which
may reflect that, if the Company is advised by the managing underwriter
or managing underwriters that the Public Preferred Stock (represented by
Depositary Shares), Series A Debentures or Series B Debentures would be
priced in excess of the Maximum Price applicable to such security (so that
such security, if priced at the applicable Maximum Pricing, could only
be sold at less than par), and is further advised that consistent with
industry practice the Underwriting Alternative would be facilitated by
the sale of such securities at or closer to par, the Company may reduce
the amount of such securities to be sold and increase the dividend or interest
rate above the applicable Maximum Pricing so that such securities may be
sold at or closer to par, <i>provided </i>that the aggregate amount of
dividends payable annually in respect of the Public Preferred Stock (represented
by the Depositary Shares) to be sold, and the aggregate amount of interest
payable annually in respect of either series of Debentures to be sold,
that are priced above the applicable Maximum Pricing may not exceed the
aggregate amount of dividends or interest payable annually in respect of
such security at the applicable Maximum Pricing with respect to the amount
of such securities as originally proposed to be offered. If the Underwriting
Alternative with respect to the Depositary Shares and both series of Debentures
is consummated, the amount of cash payable in respect of each Old Share
shall equal the sum of (i) $25.80 per share and (ii) the gross proceeds
(price to public without deducting any underwriting discount or other costs)
received by the Company for each $31.10 liquidation preference of the Public
Preferred Stock as represented by Depositary Shares in the appropriate
underwriting (the "Depositary Share Proceeds Amount"), (iii) the gross
proceeds (price to public without deducting any underwriting discount or
other costs) received by United for each $15.55 principal amount of Series
A Debentures in the appropriate underwriting (the "Series A Debenture Proceeds
Amount") and (iv) the gross proceeds (price to public without deducting
any underwriting discount or other costs) received by United for each $15.55
principal amount of Series B Debentures in the appropriate underwriting
(the "Series B Debenture Proceeds Amount").

advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial

request and will instruct the Company's officers, employees, counsel and
financial advisors to cooperate reasonably with each Union and each Union's
counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other designated representatives
in their investigation of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries
and to take such steps as may be reasonably requested by each Union and
such counsel, advisors, auditors and other representatives to assist them
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided

warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company to each Union under
this Agreement. Each Union, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other designated representatives shall conduct themselves under this Section
5.3 so as not to interfere with the day-to-day operations of the Company.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Other Potential Transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations with, or provide

or exchange offer for, shares of capital stock or similar transaction,
involving a change of control of the Company or all or substantially all

The Company may, directly or indirectly, furnish information and access,
in each case in response to an unsolicited request therefor, to the same
extent permitted by Section 5.3 hereof, to any corporation, partnership,
person or other entity or group pursuant to appropriate confidentiality
agreements, and may participate in discussions and negotiate with such
entity or group concerning any such transaction, if the entire Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") (and, to the extent a director is
a participant in an alternative Acquisition, the disinterested members
of the Board) determine in their good faith judgment, upon advice of independent
legal and financial advisors (who may be the Company's regularly engaged
independent legal and financial advisors), that such action is required
by their fiduciary duties. In addition, the Company's officers and other
appropriate personnel may take such steps as are necessary or appropriate
to provide the Board with sufficient information to make an informed decision
concerning the matters described in the previous sentence and, if the Board
so determines that such actions are required by their fiduciary duties,
the Company may direct its officers and other appropriate personnel to
cooperate with and be reasonably available to consult with any such entity
or group which were the subject of such determination. Nothing herein shall
prevent the Board from taking, and disclosing to the Company's shareholders,
a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the

fiduciary duty imposed thereby.

so as to require the distribution of the consideration received upon redemption
of the Redeemable Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 1.3 to be
received by such plans in the Reclassification, or the cash proceeds from
the sale thereof, to participants, subject to applicable law. Consistent
with existing Company policy with respect to purchases of Old Shares, the

contractual, legal or fiduciary duty. The term "person" shall be broadly
interpreted to include, without limitation, any individual, corporation,
company, unincorporated association, partnership, group or other entity.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) Each Union shall limit access to the Confidential Information to
its officials and Representatives who in the reasonable judgment of such
Union need to know the Confidential Information for purposes of participating
in making decisions concerning, or advising it with respect to, the Confidential
Information ("informed officials and Representatives"). Disclosure of Confidential
Information may be made only to officers, directors, employees, accountants,
counsel, consultants, advisors and agents of one of the Unions who executes
a Confidentiality Statement (a "Representative"), in the form attached
either to this Agreement as Schedule 6.1 or as an attachment to a confidentiality
agreement between the Company and such Union entered into prior to the
date hereof (a "Confidentiality Statement"). An executed original of each
such Confidentiality Statement shall be provided to the Company by the
Union obtaining it. Each Union and its Representatives tray discuss with
the informed officials and Representatives of each other Union the Confidential
Information which such Union has been provided pursuant to this Agreement
or any prior confidentiality agreement between the Company afar such Union
relating to the Confidential Information provided that such Confidential
Information shall continue to be subject to this Agreement and any other
applicable confidentiality agreement. In all events, each Union shall be
responsible for any actions by its Representatives which are not in accordance
with the provisions hereof and of any Confidentiality Statement executed
by a Representative but shall not be responsible for such actions of any
informed official or Representative of the other Union. ..
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) In the event that a Union, its Representatives or anyone to whom
a Union or its Representatives supply Confidential Information are requested
or required through legal process (by oral questions, interrogatories,
requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand,
any informal or formal investigation by any government or governmental
agency or authority or otherwise) to disclose any Confidential Information,
the Union will, upon learning of such request or requirement, (i) immediately
notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding
such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking
legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) if disclosure
of such information is required, furnish only that portion of the Confidential
Information which, in the opinion of the Union's legal counsel, it is legally
compelled to disclose and cooperate with any action by the Company to obtain
an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(d) Except in respect of any Confidential Information that is in this
Agreement (or may in the future be) the subject of an express representation
by the Company, (i) neither the Company nor its employees, agents, affiliates
or representatives (collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Company
Representatives") makes any express or implied representation as to the
accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information and (ii) each
Union and its Representatives agree that neither the Company nor any Company
Representative shall have any liability to such Union or its Representatives
resulting from the use by such Union or its Representatives of Confidential
Information. So long as neither Union is in material breach of its obligations
under this Section 6.1, nothing in this Section 6.1(d) is intended to limit
Section 5.3.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(e) Each Union hereby acknowledges that it is aware, and that it will
advise its Representatives who are informed in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, as to the matters which are the subject of this Agreement,
that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received
from an issuer material, non-public information concerning the matters
which are the subject of this Agreement from purchasing or selling securities
of such issuer due to the receipt of Confidential Information or from communicating
such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is
reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such
securities due to the receipt of Confidential Information.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(f) Each Union expressly acknowledges that (i) the preservation of the
confidentiality of the Confidential Information has highly important commercial
significance for the Company and (ii) its unauthorized disclosure could
have serious and irreparable adverse commercial, financial and legal consequences
for the Company. It accordingly agrees that the Company shall be entitled
to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Section, in addition to any other
remedy to which the Company may be entitled, at law or in equity or pursuant
to this Agreement.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(g) Each Union and its Representatives hereby acknowledge that the Confidential
Information is being furnished to them solely in connection with a review
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
analysis of the Company's business and financial condition and none of
such Unions or their Representatives shall use the Confidential Information
other than in connection with such review and analysis and potential responses
thereto made directly to the Company (which may be discussed among and
be made by the Unions). No right or license, express or implied, under
any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary right
in the Confidential Information is granted hereunder by United to a Union
or its Representatives.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(h) Each Union will keep a record of the location of the Confidential
Information. If the Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time,
each Union agrees for itself and for its Representatives who reviewed the
Confidential Information, to return to the Company or destroy all documents
reflecting the Confidential Information and to certify in writing to the
Company that such documents have been so returned or destroyed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Labor Agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Such
Union shall execute and deliver, at the Effective Time, the relevant Labor
Agreement.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>No Public Director Nominations.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</i>Such Union shall not, directly or indirectly, nominate or cause to
be nominated any individual for election as an Outside- Public Director
(as defined in Article FIFTH, Section 2.3 of the Restated Certificate)
of the Company; provided, <i>however, </i>that any such nomination by an
employee of the Company or United, acting in his or her individual capacity
as a shareholder of the Company, shall not be deemed to violate this Section
6.3 so long as such nomination was not made with the advice, support, or
assistance of any officer of such Union.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Independent Director Vacancies.&nbsp;
</i>The Unions agree to use their best efforts to cause any Independent
Director vacancy resulting after the Effective Time promptly to be filled
in accordance with Article FIFTH, Section 4.1.6 of the Restated Certificate.

its obligations under Section 5.1 of this Agreement; provided that the
Company's right to so terminate its obligations under Section 5.1 shall

the preceding sentence, either of the Unions may terminate this Agreement.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Effect of Termination.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</i>Except as provided in the next sentence, if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1 or 9.2, this Agreement shall become void and of
no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto, except that
the agreements contained in Sections 6.1, 9.3 and 10.4 shall survive the
termination hereof. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the failure
of the Effective Time to occur on or prior to the Outside Termination Date
results directly from either (i) a material breach of a specific material
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement by one of the parties
hereto under circumstances where the breaching party had actual knowledge
at the date of this Agreement that such representation or warranty was
materially false or misleading or (ii) a material breach of a specific
material covenant (a breach described in clause (i) or (ii), as modified
by proviso (A) hereto, being called a "Willful Breach"), and one of the
other parties hereto has established, as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction, that such Willful Breach has occurred, the breaching party
shall be liable to the other parties hereto for proximate and provable
damages resulting from such Willful Breach (which shall include the reasonable
fees and expenses of such non-breaching parties, including reasonable attorney's
fees and expenses, incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby other than in connection with any litigation or other dispute between
or among parties hereto); provided (A) to the extent that the material
breach of a specific material covenant is not determinable solely by an
objective fact (e.g. any best efforts obligation or requirement of reasonableness)
such breach shall be actionable hereunder only if the breaching party knew
(or demonstrated reckless disregard for whether) its action or failure
to act was in violation of such covenant; and (B) such calculation of damages
shall not include consequential or punitive damages and shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the non-breaching parties in the event of a Willful
Breach. With respect to a Willful Breach, "knowledge" (or any corollary
thereof) or "reckless disregard" shall mean the knowledge or reckless disregard
of the senior executives or officials of the Company and United or the
Unions, as the case may be, each of whom shall conclusively be deemed to
have read this Agreement.

<p>SECTION 10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Survival.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate
or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective
Time. The agreements of the parties contained herein and in any certificate
or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective
Time unless expressly provided in such agreement (it being understood that,
without limiting the survival of any other agreements contained herein
the survival of which is expressly provided for in such agreement, the
following agreements shall survive the Effective Time: Sections 1.2, 1.3,
1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 2.3, 2.4, clause (iii) of the last sentence
of Section 5.1, 5.7, 5.8(b), 5.10, 5.11, 6.3, 6.4, 10.2 and 10.4) (all
such surviving agreements being referred to herein as the "Express Agreements").
Except with respect to any Collective Bargaining Agreement (as defined
in the Restated Certificate) and the Express Agreements, from and after
the consummation of each of the transactions contemplated to take place
at or about the Effective Time, each of the parties hereto (in their capacities
as such) fully releases, discharges, waives, and renounces (collectively
"Releases") any and all claims, controversies, demands, rights, disputes
and causes of action it may have had at or prior to the Effective Time
against, and agrees not to initiate any suit, action or other proceeding
involving, each of the other parties hereto, its officials, officers, directors,
employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents and,
if applicable, security holders relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (including, but not limited to,
matters contemplated under Section 5.11 and matters involving claims, controversies,
demands, rights, disputes or cause of action based on securities laws,
ERISA, common law tort theory or any other similar bodies of law); provided
that the foregoing Releases shall not apply to any claims, controversies,
demands, rights, disputes and causes of action arising from and after the
Effective Time (and based on facts and circumstances arising from and after
the Effective Time) under any of the documents, instruments or transactions
entered into, filed or effected in connection with the Recapitalization
(other than this Agreement, to the extent provided in this Section 10.2).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>SECTION 10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Amendments; No Waivers.</i></dir>
(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, an amendment to this Agreement
to extend the Outside Termination Time) if, and only if, such amendment
or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the
Company and each Union or in the case of a waiver, by the party against
whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that no amendment to or waiver
of an Express Agreement shall be effective against a person entitled to
enforce such Express Agreement pursuant to Section 10.8 unless agreed to
in writing by such person; and provided, <i>further, </i>that after the
adoption of the Shareholder Vote Matters by the stockholders of the Company,
no such amendment or waiver shall, without the further approval of such
stockholders if and to the extent such approval is required by Delaware
Law, alter or change (i) the amount or kind of consideration to be received
in connection with the Recapitalization, (ii) any term of the Restated
Certificate or (iii) any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement if
such alteration or change would materially adversely affect the holders
of any shares of capital stock of the Company.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights
and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by law.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Fees and Expenses; Indemnification.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) Except as provided in the fee letter agreement, dated the date hereof,
among the Company and the Unions (the "Fee Letter"), or hereafter agreed
by the parties in writing or as set forth in this Section, all fees, costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such fee, cost or expense. The parties agree that the
fees, costs and expenses of the Deadlock Firm and the Solvency Firm shall
be paid by the Company. The Company represents and agrees that the fees
of its principal financial and legal advisors to be incurred by the Company
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other
than fees in connection with the underwriting described in Section 1.11
hereof shall not exceed $25 million.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) Upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event (as defined below), the
Company shall promptly pay to or at the direction of the Unions any amounts
the Company would otherwise have been required to pay pursuant to the Fee
Letter had the Effective Time occurred at the time of the occurrence of
such Triggering Event. Such amounts shall be exclusive of any amounts paid
or payable pursuant to indemnification or contribution arrangements. For
purposes of this paragraph (b), "Triggering Event" shall mean the occurrence
of each of the following: (i)(A) following the public announcement of a
proposal for an Acquisition, either the stockholders of the Company shall
not have approved the Shareholder Vote Matters at the Company Stockholder
Meeting or (B) the Board shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner materially
adverse to the Unions its approval or recommendation of the Recapitalization
or the Shareholder Vote Matters or shall have recommended, or failed to
recommend against, another Acquisition; (ii) subsequent to the stockholder
or Board action referred to in clause (i) above, this Agreement shall have
been terminated by the Company pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(i) or 9.1(d)(ii)
or by either Union pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(i) or 9.1(c)(i); and (iii)
within 12 months of the termination of the Agreement in accordance with
clause (ii) above, an Acquisition shall have been consummated.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) All amounts payable by the Company to either Union under this Section
10.4 shall be paid directly to such Union or directly to persons designated
in writing by such Union as such Union may specify.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(d) To the extent that the Company shall make payments to, or on behalf
of, either Union under this Section 10.4 and such Union is reimbursed by
another source (or otherwise receives a refund of the amount paid), such
Union shall return such amounts to the Company to the extent of such reimbursement
(or refund).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(e) The Company (the "Indemnitor") shall indemnify the Unions, their
controlling persons, and their respective directors, trustees, officers,
partners, affiliates, agents, representatives, advisors and employees (a
"Union Indemnified Person") against and hold each Union Indemnified Person
harmless from any and all liabilities, losses, claims, damages, actions,
proceedings, investigations or threats thereof (all of the foregoing, and
including expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements
and other charges) incurred in connection with the defense thereof, except
as set forth below, being referred to as "Liabilities") based upon, relating
to or arising out of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation,
the underwriting described in Section 1.11 hereof); <i>provided, however,
</i>that
the Indemnitor shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any such Liability arises out of any inaccurate information supplied by
any such Union Indemnified Person specifically for inclusion in the proxy
materials related to such transactions or any other filings made by the
Company or any Union Indemnified Person with any federal or state governmental
agency in connection therewith (including without limitation the prospectuses
relating to the underwriting described in Section 1.11 hereof) or if any
such Liability is finally judicially determined, not subject to further
appeal, to have resulted from bad faith, willful misconduct or negligence
on such Union Indemnified Person's part. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, "Liabilities" shall not include any losses,
claims, damages or expenses (including attorneys' fees, disbursements and
other charges) based upon, relating to or arising out of any action, claim,
proceeding, investigation or threat thereof (i) brought by a Union against
the other Union, (ii) brought by any employee of the Company or a subsidiary
of the Company, as such, represented by a Union or any member of a Union
(whether or not an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company),
in his or her capacity as such, if, and only if, the underlying action,
claim, proceeding or threat is made against (1) his or her Union or (2)
against the other Union, (iii) brought by any Union or any Union Indemnified
Person against the Company or any controlling persons, directors, officers,
partners, agents, representatives, advisors or employees of the Company
(a "Company Related Person") or by the Company or any Company Related Person
against any Union or Union Indemnified Person or (iv) which arise primarily
as a result of acts by a Union Indemnified Person following the Effective
Time.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(f) In connection with the Indemnitor's obligation to indemnify for
expenses as set forth above in subsection (e) of this Section, the Indemnitor
further agrees to reimburse each Union Indemnified Person for all such
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements and other
charges) as they are incurred by such Union Indemnified Person, provided,
however, that if a Union Indemnified Person is reimbursed hereunder for
any such expenses, such reimbursement of expenses shall be refunded to
the extent it is finally judicially determined, not subject to further
appeal, that the Union Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification
by reason of the proviso clause in the first sentence or the last sentence
of subsection (e) of this Section. The Company shall not be required to
reimburse any Union Indemnified Person<b> </b>for the reasonable attorney's
fees, disbursements or other charges of more than one counsel (plus local
counsel, if appropriate), or of more than one counsel (plus local counsel,
if appropriate) for any one Union (together with Union Indemnified Persons
who are controlling persons, directors, officers, partners, affiliates,
agents, representatives, advisors and employees of such Union) who can
be represented by common counsel so long as no conflict of interest or
different or additional colorable defenses are reasonably believed by such
Indemnified Persons to exist between or among them relative to the claims
asserted.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(g) Promptly after receipt by a Union Indemnified Person of notice of
any claim or the commencement of any action, proceeding or investigation
in respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought as provided
in this Section, such Union Indemnified Person will notify the Indemnitor
in writing of the receipt or commencement thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation or liability
which it may have pursuant to this Section or otherwise except to the extent
that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced thereby. In case any such
action, proceeding or investigation is brought or threatened against a
Union Indemnified Person, the Indemnitor will be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof,
with counsel selected by the Indemnitor and approved by the Union Indemnified
Person (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). After notice from
the Indemnitor to such Union Indemnified Person of its election to assume
the defense thereof, the Indemnitor will not be liable to such Union Indemnified
Person for any legal expense subsequently incurred for services rendered
by any other counsel retained by such Union Indemnified Person in connection
with the defense unless such Union Indemnified Person, in the opinion of
its counsel, has colorable defenses which are different from or in addition
to defenses available to the Indemnitor or the Indemnitor has an interest
which conflicts with the interests of such Union Indemnified Person and
which makes separate representation advisable, in which event all legal
expenses of such Union Indemnified Person (subject to the last sentence
of subsection (f) above) shall continue to be paid by the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding.
Section 10.4(f), the indemnification provided for in this Section 10.4
shall include reimbursement for all expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees, disbursements and other charges) incurred by Union Indemnified Persons
to enforce their rights under this Section 10.4. The Indemnitor shall not
settle any action, claim, proceeding or investigation which is the subject
of this Section 10.4 without the prior written approval of the Union Indemnified
Person (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), unless such settlement
involves solely the payment of money and the Indemnitor is not contesting
any right of a Union Indemnified Person to receive. indemnification hereunder.
References to Union Indemnified Persons shall in all cases include the
controlling persons, directors, officers, affiliates, agents, representatives,
advisors and employees of each Union Indemnified Person.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(h) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10.4 is finally
judicially determined, not subject to further appeal, to be unavailable
to a Union Indemnified Person, then the Indemnitor shall, in lieu of indemnifying
such Union Indemnified Person, contribute to the amount paid or payable
in respect of any Liability by such Union Indemnified Person in such proportion
as shall be fair and equitable after taking into account the relative benefits
received by the parties, the relative fault of the parties and such other
equitable considerations as any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the benefits received by a Union
Indemnified Person that is an advisor shall not be deemed to exceed the
amount of fees payable to such Union Indemnified Person. The rights accorded
to the Indemnified Persons under this Section 10.4 shall be in addition
to any rights that any Union Indemnified Person may have at common law,
by separate agreement or otherwise.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(i) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of the present or
former directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Indemnified Persons")
as provided in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or
other agreements or arrangements, or articles of incorporation or by-laws
(or similar documents) or other agreements or arrangements of any Subsidiary
as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time and shall
continue in full force and effect. In addition, the Company shall provide,
for a period of not less than six years following the Effective Time, for
directors' and officers' liability insurance for the benefit of directors
and officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time with
respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time by electing,
in its sole discretion, one of the two alternatives set forth below (which
election shall be reported to the Unions prior to the Effective Time):
(i) maintain for a period of not less than six years following the Effective
Time, the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, provided
that in satisfying its obligation under this clause (i), the Company shall
not be obligated to pay premiums in excess of 150% of the amount per annum
the Company paid for the policy year ending during calendar year 1994,
which amount has been disclosed to the Unions or (ii) purchase, prior to
the Effective Time, run-off coverage for the benefit of directors and officers
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time for matters occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, which coverage shall provide for a separate
insurance pool for such directors and officers of at least $75 million
in coverage, provided, that in satisfying the obligations under this clause
(ii), the Company shall not pay in excess of an amount set forth in a letter
previously delivered by the Company to counsel to the Unions. The Company
shall also maintain for a period of not less than six years following the
Effective Time, the current fiduciaries' liability insurance with respect
to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION <i>10.5&nbsp;&nbsp; Successors and Assigns.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided

transferees or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties or assets to any transferee or (iii) engages in any
similar transaction with any person, then, as a condition to the consummation
of such transaction, proper provision shall be made so the successor, transferee
or assignee of the Company pursuant to such transaction assumes the obligations
of the Company set forth in each of the Express Agreements.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 10.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Governing Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This
Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law
of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles
thereof. The parties agree that this Agreement (including the Schedules
and other attachments hereto), other than Schedules 1.6(a)(i), 1.6(a)(ii),
1.6(a)(iii), 1.6(a)(iv), <i>5.8(i) </i>and <i>5.8(ii) </i>(to the extent
such Schedules relate to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
represented by the Unions), shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of
any System Board of Adjustment under the Railway Labor Act.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 10.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Counterparts; Efectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</i>This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective
when each party hereto shall have received counterparts hereof signed by
all of the other parties hereto.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 10.8<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Parties in Interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely, other than the provisions
of Section 10.4, to the-benefit of the parties hereto, and, except for
the Express Agreements, nothing in the Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other person any rights, benefits or remedies.
With respect to the Express Agreements, the agreements set forth in the
following Sections are for the benefit of, and may be enforced by, the
following parties: Sections 1.2, 1.3, <i>1.5, </i>6.3 and 6.4: the holders
of New Shares; Section 1.7: holders of Options; Section 1.8: holders of

<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 10.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific <i>Performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</i>Prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, the
parties agree that in the event a Willful Breach is established by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the other parties hereto shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof which were the subject of such
Willful Breach; <i>provided, however, in </i>no event shall such remedy
of specific performance in any way extend or modify the Outside Termination
Date. The parties acknowledge that in the event of a Willful Breach, irreparable
damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would
be difficult to determine. No other remedy shall be available prior to
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement except that the
remedy of damages shall be available if such remedy (including the amount
of damages) would be available after termination pursuant to the terms
of Section 9.3 hereof.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SECTION 10.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Entire Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Except
as otherwise explicitly set forth in this Agreement, or in other writings

under the Trust Indenture Act<i> </i>of 1939, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "TIA"). The Debentures shall be issued only
in denominations of $100 and integral multiples thereof or, if the Underwriting
Alternative with respect to either series of Debentures is consummated
at or prior to the Effective Time and the Company so elects, denominations
of $1,000 and integral multiple thereof, in which case conforming changes

<br>&nbsp;
<div align=right>EXHIBIT C</div>

<p><br>&nbsp;<u>Section 1.11 Underwriting Alternative</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Company has elected to pursue the underwriting of (a) a number of
Depositary Shares calculated as provided in the next sentence, (b) $382.5
million principal amount of Series A Debentures, subject to reduction as
described below, and (c) $382.5 principal amount of Series B Debentures,
subject to reduction as described below (referred to collectively herein
as the "Underwriting Alternative"), and the consummation of the underwritings
with respect to the Depositary Shares and the Debentures shall be in lieu
of issuing Depositary Shares and Debentures to holders of Old Shares pursuant
to Section 1.5 hereof, to holders of Options pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof
and to holders of Convertible Company Securities pursuant to Section 1.8
hereof. The number of Depositary Shares that shall be subject to the Underwriting
Alternative (which may be rounded up to produce an aggregate amount of
Depositary Shares that is consistent with customary aggregate underwriting
denominations)<i> </i>shall equal one twenty-fifth of the excess of (I)
the product of $765 million and a fraction (such fraction, which shall
in no event be greater than one, is referred to herein as the "Liquidation
Preference Fraction"), the numerator of which is 11.375%, and the denominator
of which is the Applicable Rate with respect to the Depositary Shares assuming
that the Underwriting Alternative<i> </i>with respect to the Depositary
Shares is consummated, over (II) $300 million. The Company shall use its
best efforts to accomplish such underwritings, including entering into
a firm commitment underwriting agreement or agreements, provided, however,
that the Company may elect to terminate the Underwriting Alternative at
any time prior to the Effective Time. The Unions will cooperate and use
their respective best efforts to facilitate the underwritings. The Underwriting
Alternative will be effected in accordance with customary underwriting
agreements which may reflect that, if the Company is advised by the managing
underwriter or managing underwriters that the Series A Debentures or Series
B Debentures would be priced in excess of the maximum price applicable
to such security (so that such security, if priced at the applicable Maximum
Pricing, could only be sold at less than par), and is further advised that
consistent with industry practice the Underwriting Alternative will be
facilitated by the sale of such securities at or closer to par, the Company
may reduce the amount of such securities to be sold and increase the interest
rate above the applicable Maximum Pricing so that such securities may be
sold at or closer to par, provided that (1)<i> </i>the yield to maturity
of the reduced par amount of Debentures will not exceed the yield to maturity
that would result if the unreduced par amount of such Debentures were priced
at a discount to par using the Maximum Pricing for the respective Debenture
and (2) the proceeds from the issuance of the reduced par amount of Debentures
will equal the proceeds that would result if the unreduced par amount of
such Debentures were priced at a discount to par using the Maximum Pricing
for the respective Debenture. If the Underwriting Alternative is consummated,
the amount of cash payable in respect of each Old Share shall equal the
sum of (i) $25.80<i> </i>per share, (ii) the sum of $12.20<i> </i>and the
gross proceeds (price to the public without deducting any underwriting
discount or other cost) received by the Company from the sale of the "Underwriting
Liquidation Preference" of Public Preferred Stock as represented by Depositary
Shares in the Underwriting Alternative (collectively, the "Depositary Share
Proceeds Amount"), (iii) the gross proceeds (price to the public without
deducting any underwriting discount or other costs) received by United
from the sale of each $15.55 principal amount of Series A Debentures in
the Underwriting Alternative (subject to adjustment as described in the
immediately preceding sentence, the "Series A Debenture Proceeds Amount")
and (iv) the gross proceeds (price to the public without deducting any
underwriting discount or other costs) received by United from the sale
of each $15.55 principal amount of Series B Debentures in the Underwriting
Alternative (subject to adjustment as described in the immediately preceding
sentence, the "Series B Debenture Proceeds Amount"). The "Underwriting
Liquidation Preference" shall equal the excess of (I) the product of $31.10
and the Liquidation Preference Fraction over (III) $12.20.

<p>UAL CORPORATION
<p>EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
<p>(Effective as of July 12, 1994)
<p>PREAMBLE</center>

<p>Nature of Plan
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Plan has been established to enable Eligible
Employees of the Company and certain of its Affiliates to acquire stock
ownership interests in the Company. The Plan is designed to invest exclusively
in Company Stock (except for de minimis investments of cash pending investment
in Company Stock or pending distribution to Participants) and, to the extent
it is an employee stock ownership plan, primarily in "qualifying employer
securities" (as defined in Code section 4975(e)(8)).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to Section 13, the Plan is intended to be
permanent and to benefit Eligible Employees of the Company and its participating
Affiliates on the Effective Date, as well as the Eligible Employees entering
employment thereafter.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Plan consists of an employee stock ownership
plan and a stock bonus plan. The employee stock ownership plan ("Part A"
hereof) forms a part of the stock bonus plan, includes a money purchase
pension plan and is intended to be qualified under Code sections 401(a)
and 4975(e)(7). With respect to the portion of this Plan that is an employee
stock ownership plan, as a single employee stock ownership plan: (i) the
Initial Acquisition Loan and the Additional Acquisition Loans shall be
a joint obligation of the component plans, (ii) the Plan shall not maintain
separate Loan Suspense Accounts for the stock bonus and money purchase
pension components, (111) dividends paid on Company Stock in either such
component plan shall be used to repay the Initial Acquisition Loan and
the Additional Acquisition Loans to the extent provided in the Plan, and
(iv) separate Accounts shall not be maintained for Participants with respect
to such component plans. The Trust holding the assets of the Trust Fund
is intended to be exempt from taxation under Code section 501(a).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Plan consists of two portions, a "leveraged"
portion (Part A) that is intended to be an employee stock ownership plan
and an "unleveraged" portion (Part B). Part A consists of both a stock
bonus plan component and a money purchase pension plan component and Part
B consists solely of a stock bonus plan component. Unless the context otherwise
requires or unless specifically provided, all provisions of this Plan document
shall apply to both Part A and Part B.
<p>Transaction
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Plan is part of an overall program (which includes
the Supplemental Plan) resulting in the acquisition by Eligible Employees
of a majority ownership stake in the Company as contemplated by the Agreement
and Plan of Recapitalization, among UAL Corporation and Air Line Pilots
Association, International and International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers, as amended (the "Recapitalization Agreement"). Specifically,
on the Effective Date, Eligible Employees will become entitled to receive
55% of the equity and voting power of the Company through the Trust and
the Supplemental Trust. The overall program will be accomplished by the
allocation to individual Participant accounts over the Wage Investment
Period of shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock, Class 2 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock and Voting Preferred Stock under the Trust and Supplemental
Trust (or equivalent fictional book-entry shares under the Supplemental
Plan), which shares shall, in the aggregate, be convertible into shares
of Common Stock in an amount that represents 55% of the Company's equity
and voting power measured as of the Effective Date. In addition, as described
under the paragraph entitled "Additional Shares" below, depending on the
market price per share of the Common Stock during the one-year period commencing
on the Effective Date, up to an additional 8% of the Company's equity and
voting power may be allocated to Participants' accounts under the Plan
and the Supplemental Plan, bringing the total up to 63% of the equity and
voting power of the Company.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the overall Employee stake, 46.23% of the underlying
shares, including the Additional Shares, if any, will be reserved for allocation
to the ALPA Employee Group, 37.13% of the underlying shares will be reserved
for allocation to the IAM Employee Group and 16.64 % of the underlying
shares will be reserved for allocation to the Management and Salaried Employee
Group.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there were no Code limitations on compensation
and allocations, all shares to be acquired under the overall program would
be delivered solely under Part A and such shares would be allocated to
Participants of the respective Employee Groups over the Wage Investment
Period in accordance with the percentages set forth in the preceding paragraph.
Because such Code limitations will, in fact, operate to limit the annual
benefits available under Part A, only a portion (expected to be approximately
78.15% of the underlying shares of Preferred Stock) will be acquired by
the Trust from time to time on and after the Effective Date and allocated
to Participants under Part A. To maximize certain employee stock ownership
plan-related tax benefits, the Employee Groups may receive less than their
overall equity ownership interest under Part A, with the balance to be
received under Part B and the Supplemental Plan. Most of the shares allocable
under Part B and the Supplemental Plan will be allocable to the ALPA Employee
Group. (The preceding does not refer to Voting Preferred Stock; it will
be contributed and allocated for all Employee Groups as described below
under the paragraph entitled "Part B: Voting Preferred Stock.")
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shares not acquired under Part A will be allocated
to appropriate Participant Accounts under Part B, subject to Code limitations,
including Code sections 401(a)(4), 401(a)(17) and 415. To the extent that
shares cannot be allocated under Part B by reason of those Code limitations,
such shares will be allocated to accounts of appropriate Participants in
accordance with the provisions of the Supplemental Plan.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The combined effect of the allocations under the
overall program (Part A, Part B and the Supplemental Plan) will be to put
each Participant, to the extent possible, in the position such Participant
would have been had all shares, including the Additional Shares, if any,
been delivered to and allocated under Part A.
<p>Part A
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to Part A, it is intended that, on the
Effective Date and from time to time thereafter, the Trustee will enter
into the Initial Acquisition Loan and Additional Acquisition Loans on behalf
of the Trust and use the proceeds thereof to purchase shares of Preferred
Stock, representing approximately 42.9825% of the equity of the Company
(subject to increase due to any Additional Shares issued). The Preferred
Stock purchased will be Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock. The shares
of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock will be allocated ratably, over the
Wage Investment Period, to the Employee Groups in accordance with the following
percentages:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ALPA Employee Group - 31.759437%
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
IAM Employee Group - 47.511196%
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Management and Salaried Employee Group - 20.729367%
<p>Part B: Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to Part B, it is intended that the Company
will contribute (or will cause the trustee of the Supplemental Trust to
transfer), during the Wage Investment Period, shares of Class 2 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock (including Additional Shares, if any) to the Plan. Subject
to certain Code limitations, Such shares will be allocated to Participants
who receive less than their full entitlement under the overall program
under Part A. In general, the formula for determining the amount of allocations
under Part B to make up for the shortfall of Company Stock delivered under
Part A is set forth in Section 5.4(c).
<p>Part B: Voting Preferred Stock
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to Part B, it is also intended that
the Company will contribute, during the Wage Investment Period, shares
of Voting Preferred Stock to the Plan. The Voting Preferred Stock contributed
will be comprised of three classes. A separate class of Voting Preferred
Stock, representing 25.4265% of the voting power of the Company, will be
reserved for allocation to Participants who are members of the ALPA Employee
Group ("Class P"); a separate class of Voting Preferred Stock, representing
20.4215% of the voting power of the Company, will be reserved for allocation
to Participants who are members of the IAM Employee Group ("Class M");
and a separate class of Voting Preferred Stock, representing 9.152% of
the voting power of the Company, will be reserved for allocation to Participants
who are members of the Management and Salaried Employee Group ("Class S").
(The shares reserved above include shares reserved for allocation to the
respective Employee Groups under the Supplemental Plan and Supplemental
Trust.) Such percentages shall be appropriately adjusted in the event the
initial Employee ownership percentage is increased (up to 63% in the aggregate)
as provided below. It is intended that the number of shares of Voting Preferred
Stock to be allocated to each Participant's Account on each Valuation Date
will equal the number of shares of Preferred Stock allocated to that Participant
under Part A and Part B on such Valuation Date (taking into account the
special Effective Date contribution and allocation described below). The
terms of each class of Voting Preferred Stock provide that the shares outstanding
at any particular time (in combination with any shares of Common Stock
held by the Trustee or trustee under the Supplemental Trust allocable or
allocated to the relevant Employee Group) will command the aggregate voting
power reserved for such Employee Group. Thus, for example, if there are
100 shares of Class P outstanding, each such share will command 1% of the
voting power reserved for the ALPA Employee Group (25.4265%, assuming 55%
ownership by Employees). As additional shares of Class P are issued. the
per share voting power will decrease proportionately.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a special Employer Contribution, one share of
each of Class P, Class M and Class S will be contributed by the Company
to Part B on the Effective Date. These three shares will be allocated,
per capita, to the Accounts of the appropriate Participants under Part
B on the Effective Date.
<p>Supplemental Plan and Supplemental Trust
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the extent that, in any Plan Year during the Wage
Investment Period. shares of Company Stock cannot be allocated to a Participant's
Account by reason of any Code limitations, including Code section 401(a)(17),
Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(4), appropriate credits will be
made to the accounts of the affected Participants under the Supplemental
Plan (attached hereto as Exhibit A) in accordance with the terms thereof
and shares of Voting Preferred Stock (and in certain circumstances, Class
2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock) used to satisfy the relevant credits will
be held in the Supplemental Trust (attached hereto as Exhibit B) in accordance
with the terms thereof for the benefit of the affected Participants.
<p>Part B: Flowback
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During and after the Wage Investment Period, to the
extent that the allocation of shares of Company Stock under the Plan for
any Participant was limited in a prior Plan Year by reason of the limitations
of Code section 401(a)(17), Code section 415 or Code section 401(a)(4)
(with the result that the Participant received corresponding credits under
the Supplemental Plan), it is intended that the Company will contribute
(or the Company will cause the trustee of the Supplemental Trust to transfer)
to such Participant's Account shares of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock
and shares of Voting Preferred Stock, as the case may be, in a subsequent
Plan Year, and that such shares will be allocated under this Plan to the
Accounts of the affected Participants in accordance with the terms hereof,
subject to any applicable Code limitations as applied to the subsequent
Plan Year (and corresponding debits will be made under the Supplemental
Plan).
<p>Additional Shares:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the fair market value per share of the
Common Stock during the one-year period commencing on the Effective Date,
a number of additional shares determined in accordance with Section 1.6
and Section 1.10 of the Recapitalization Agreement will be allocated to
Participants' Accounts under the Plan and participants' accounts under
the Supplemental Plan over the remainder of the Wage Investment Period.
Such number of shares of Company Stock will be allocated to the Employee
Groups in accordance with the percentages specified in the paragraph above
entitled "Transaction. "
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, 78.15% of the Additional Shares which
are Preferred Stock will be Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock; provided,
however, that the portion of the Additional Shares attributable to Preferred
Stock allocated as of December 31, 1994 will be Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock contributed to Part B or allocated as credits under the Supplemental
Plan as of December 31, 1994. Except as described in the foregoing proviso,
it is intended that such Additional Shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock will increase, on a pro rata basis, the number of such shares acquired
pursuant to each Additional Acquisition Loan. Unless the parties agree
otherwise, these Class 1 shares will be allocated over the remainder of
the Wage Investment Period in accordance with the percentages set forth
under Part A above.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Additional Shares not sold to the Trustee pursuant
to Part A will be contributed by the Company to Part B or credited to the
Supplemental Plan during the remainder of the Wage Investment Period. Subject
to certain Code limitations, such shares will be allocated to Participants
who receive less than their full entitlement, giving effect to the allocation
of the Additional Shares, of shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock
under Part A. To the extent possible, the formula in Section 5.4(c) will
be applied by assuming all Additional Shares (other than the shares of
Voting Preferred Stock) had been sold to the Trust under Part A on the
Effective Date and allocated ratably over the following 69 months.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participation Not Guarantee

<p>SECTION 3
<p>Contributions</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employer Contributions.
Subject to the conditions and limitations of the Plan, for each Plan Year,
the Employers shall contribute to the Trust cash equal to, or Company Stock
having an aggregate fair market value equal to, such amount, if any, as
the respective boards of directors of the Employers shall determine by
resolution; provided, however, that:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part A.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Company shall contribute to Part A an amount in cash equal to the amount
required to enable the Trustee (together with dividends used to repay the
Initial Acquisition Loan and the Additional Acquisition Loans in accordance
with Section 10) to pay any principal and interest on the Initial Acquisition
Loan and the Additional Acquisition Loans payable during the Plan Year.
Of the contribution amount required to enable the Trustee to discharge
the aggregate principal and interest on such indebtedness, 60% shall be
made to the money purchase pension plan component of Part A of the Plan.
The balance of the required contribution amount shall be made to the stock
bonus plan component of Part A of the Plan. The Trustee shall apply such
money purchase pension plan component contributions to repay the principal
on each of the respective Acquisition Loans in proportion to the excess
of the principal due on such Acquisition Loan for the Plan Year over the
dividends available to repay the principal on such Acquisition Loan.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may forgive an amount of indebtedness
equal to the required Employer Contribution (or any portion thereof).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the Effective Date, the Company shall contribute an amount in cash equal
to the aggregate par value of the Company Stock to be acquired under the
Initial Acquisition Loan. In addition, the Company shall contribute an
amount in cash equal to the aggregate par value of the Company Stock, if
any, to be acquired under each Additional Acquisition Loan. Such contributions
shall first be divided, pro rata, among the Employee Groups in accordance
with Section 5.4(a)(i)(A), and then shall be allocated to the ESOP Cash
Accounts of Participants as follows: (A) in the case of the ALPA Employee
Group and the Management and Salaried Employee Group, according to the
Compensation paid to such Participants in such Employee Group for the Plan
Year, and (B) in the case of the IAM Employee Group, according to Wage
Investments of such Participants for the Plan Year. Such contribution shall
be used by the Trustee as partial consideration for the purchase of shares
of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock under the applicable Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement, and the ESOP Cash Accounts of the Participants shall
be charged accordingly. Shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock equal
in value (based on the prices per share paid by the Trustee under the applicable
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement) to the amount of such contribution
shall be allocated, as of the last day of the applicable Plan Year, from
the shares purchased under the applicable Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement
to the ESOP Stock Accounts of the Participants, pro rata, according to
the allocations of such contribution above.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part B.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the Effective Date, the Company shall contribute to Part B, as a special
Employer Contribution, one share of each of Class P, Class M and Class
S.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As soon as practicable after the end of each Plan Year, the Company shall
contribute (or shall cause the trustee of the Supplemental Trust to transfer)
to Part B shares of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock and shares of Voting
Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 5.4(c)(vii); provided, however,
that any shares of Company Stock transferred by the trustee of the Supplemental
Trust in respect of such obligation shall satisfy, to the extent of such
transfer, the Company's obligation under this Section 3.1(b). Such contributions
may not be used to repay Acquisition Loan indebtedness and shall be made
to the stock bonus plan component of the Plan.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If cash dividends have been paid to the holders of Common Stock during
any Plan Year and if dividends are applied to repay the Initial Acquisition
Loan or any Additional Acquisition Loan pursuant to Section 10 during that
Plan Year, the Company shall make an additional Employer Contribution to
Part B in the amount, if any, set forth in the next sentence as soon as
practicable after the last day for that Plan Year (and for the purpose
of this clause (iii), "Plan Year" shall be defined to include only the
period from the Effective Date to 12/31/94, the five 12-month periods ending
12/31/95 through 12/31/99, and the three-month period ending 3/31/2000).
The amount of such contribution shall equal the excess of A plus B over
C; where A equals the least of:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cash dividends (excluding dividends
that constitute Participating Dividends and Extraordinary Distributions
with respect to the outstanding Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock) that
would have been received by the Plan during that Plan Year if the outstanding
Class 1 Non- Voting Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock
immediately prior to each dividend record date, which amount shall be reduced
by the excess, if any, of the amount described in clause (11) below over
the amount described in clause (III) below;
<p>(II)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Fixed Dividends that have been paid
on the Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock during that Plan Year; and
<p>(III)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the amount of the cash dividends used
to repay the Initial Acquisition Loan and the Additional Acquisition Loans
pursuant to Section 10.1(a) during such Plan Year;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
B equals the cash dividends (excluding dividends that constitute Extraordinary
Distributions with respect to the Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock) that
would have been received by the Plan during the Plan Year if the Class
1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock contemplated for future sale to this Plan
as part of the future Additional Acquisition Loans had been, immediately
prior to each dividend record date, sold to this Plan and converted into
Common Stock. The number of shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock
contemplated for future sale shall equal 13,813,282 (adjusted for the issuance
of Additional Shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock) reduced by
the number of shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock sold to this
Plan prior to the dividend record date; and
<p>C equals the amount of cash contributions previously made pursuant to
this clause (iii) with respect to such Plan Year.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For the purposes of the Plan, "Participating Dividends", "Extraordinary
Distributions" and "Fixed Dividends" shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, Article
Fourth, Part II relating to Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation on Contributions.
In no event may any Employer Contributions under Section 3.1 for any Plan
Year exceed the maximum amount deductible as an expense for federal income
tax purposes under Code section 404; provided, however, that if Employer
Contributions are so limited, appropriate arrangements will be made in
accordance with Section 1.6(1) of the Recapitalization Agreement to protect
the substantive rights of each Employee Group (hereinafter "Appropriate
Arrangements").
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timing of Contributions.
For each Plan Year, Employer Contributions shall be due no later than the
time prescribed for filing the Employer's federal income tax return for
that Plan Year, including any extensions of time; provided, however, that
Employer Contributions shall be made at such times as to enable the Trustee
to meet its repayment obligations under the documents governing the Initial
Acquisition Loan, the Additional Acquisition Loans or as otherwise required
by the terms of the Plan.

Participants. All Employer Contributions, Company Stock acquired with Employer
Contributions and with proceeds of Acquisition Loans, and dividends and
distributions thereon, shall become a part of the Trust Fund and shall
be held and disbursed by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions
of the Plan and Trust Agreement. No person shall have any Interest in or
right to assets held in the Trust Fund except as provided in the Plan and
Trust Agreement. The Trust Fund shall be held for the exclusive benefit
of the Participants and their Beneficiaries, and shall be used solely to
pay benefits to such persons. The Trust Fund shall not revert to the benefit
of the Company or any of its Affiliates, except as provided in Section
15.2.

Stock. The Trust Fund shall be invested exclusively in shares of Company
Stock, subject to the Trustee's power to hold cash pending investment in
Company Stock or pending distribution to Participants, and, accordingly,
the Trustee may invest and hold up to 100% of the Trust Fund in Company
Stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquisition Loans. In
respect of Part A, the Trustee may incur the Initial Acquisition Loan and
the Additional Acquisition Loans. In addition, the Trustee, with the consent
of the Company, may incur other Acquisition Loans from time to time to
finance the acquisition of Company Stock for the Trust or to repay a prior
Acquisition Loan. Each Acquisition Loan shall meet all applicable legal
requirements, including those set forth under Code section 4975 and ERISA
section 408. Financed Shares shall initially be credited to the Loan Suspense
Account and shall be released for allocation to the ESOP Stock Accounts
of Participants only as payments of principal and interest, or principal,
on the Acquisition Loan are made by the Trustee. The number of Financed
Shares to be released from the Loan Suspense Account (or subaccount attributable
to that Acquisition Loan) for allocation to Participants' ESOP Stock Accounts
for each Plan Yea., shall be based upon either: (x) the ratio that the
payments of principal made on the Acquisition Loan for that Plan Year bear
to the sum of principal payments during that Plan Year, plus the projected
payments of principal during the remainder of the Acquisition Loan repayment
period, provided that the special conditions set forth under Treasury Regulation
section 54.4975-7(b)(8)(ii) are satisfied, or (y) the ratio that the payments
of principal and interest on the Acquisition Loan for that Plan Year, bear
to the sum of principal and interest payments during that Plan Year, plus
the projected payments of principal and interest during the remainder of
the Acquisition Loan repayment period. A separate ratio will be calculated
for each Acquisition Loan. The applicable loan documents will specify whether
clause (x) and/or clause (y) shall apply. Shares released from the Loan
Suspense Account in connection with the Initial Acquisition Loan and the
Additional Acquisition Loans shall be released in accordance with clause
(x) above.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiduciary Concerns. With
respect to the exercise of any fiduciary responsibility with respect to
the Plan or Trust, including, without limitation, the voting, sale, exchange,
other disposition or conversion of Company Stock, the relevant fiduciary
may, to the extent permitted by law, take into consideration any relevant
economic factors affecting the interests of current and future Participants
(and Beneficiaries), including, but not limited to, the prospect for continued
Employee enfranchisement through the voting power of Company Stock held
in the Plan, the prospect for future benefits under the Plan as a result
of the prospective release and allocation of Company Stock held in the
Loan Suspense Account and the prospect for future employment with the Company
and its Affiliates.

<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, charge to each Participant's ESOP
Stock Account all distributions and payments made to him since the last
preceding Valuation Date that have not been previously charged;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, credit to each Participant's ESOP
Stock Account the shares of Company Stock, if any, that have been purchased
with amounts from his ESOP Cash Account since the last preceding Valuation
Date, and adjust such ESOP Cash Account in accordance with the provisions
of Section 5.3; and
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, allocate and credit to each Participant's
ESOP Stock Account the shares of Company Stock representing Employer Contributions
made in the form of Company Stock and the number of Financed Shares released
under Section 4.3 that are to be allocated and credited as of that date
in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.4.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocation and Crediting
of Participants' ESOP Cash Accounts. As of each Valuation Date, the ESOP
Committee shall adjust the ESOP Cash Accounts to reflect activity since
the last preceding Valuation Date as follows:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, charge to each Participant's ESOP
Cash Account all distributions and payments made to him that have not been
previously charged;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, if Company Stock is purchased with
assets from a Participant's ESOP Cash Account, such shares shall be credited
to the ESOP Stock Account of such Participant, and the Participant's ESOP
Cash Account shall be charged accordingly;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, subject to the dividend provisions
of Section 10, the ESOP Committee shall also credit to the ESOP Cash Account
of each Participant any cash dividends paid to the Trustee on shares of
Company Stock held in that Participant's ESOP Stock Account (as of the
record date for such cash dividends) and dividends paid on shares of Company
Stock held in the Loan Suspense Account that have not been used to repay
any Acquisition Loan. Cash dividends and any earnings that have not been
used to repay any Acquisition Loan and have been credited to a Participant's
ESOP Cash Account shall be applied by the Trustee to the purchase of shares
of Common Stock, which shares shall then be credited to the ESOP Stock
Account of such Participant. The Participant's ESOP Cash Account shall
then be charged by the amount of cash used to purchase such Common Stock
or used to repay any Acquisition Loan. In addition, any earnings (i) on
ESOP Cash Accounts will be allocated to Participants' ESOP Cash Accounts,
pro rata, based on such ESOP Cash Account balances and (ii) on the Loan
Suspense Account, other than dividends used to repay the Acquisition Loan,
will be allocated to Participants' Accounts, pro rata, based on their Account
balances in Part A;
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, allocate and credit the Employer Contributions
made for the purpose of repaying any Acquisition Loan in accordance with
Section 5.4. Such amount shall then be used to repay any Acquisition Loan
and such Participant's ESOP Cash Account shall be charged accordingly;
and
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, allocate and credit the Employer
Contributions (other than amounts contributed to repay an Acquisition Loan)
that are made in cash for the Plan Year to the ESOP Cash Account of each
Participant (including Participants whose employment with the Company and
its Affiliates terminated for any reason during the Plan Year) in accordance
with Section 5.4(b).</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocation and Crediting
of Employer Contributions. As of the Valuation Date for each Plan Year,
all cash contributions and shares of Company Stock transferred by each
Employer to the Trustee for that Plan Year under Section 3.1 and the number
of Financed Shares released from the Loan Suspense Account for allocation
to Participants' ESOP Stock Accounts under Section 4.3 (except as provided
under Section 10.3) during the Plan Year shall be allocated among and credited
to the Accounts of Participants (including Participants whose employment
with the Company and its Affiliates terminated for any reason during the
Plan Year) as follows:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part A. On each Valuation Date, the cash
contributions used to repay the Acquisition Loan indebtedness and the shares
of Class 1 Non- Voting Preferred Stock released for that Plan Year shall
be allocated and credited to each Participant's Account as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Employer Contributions
made in cash used to repay each Acquisition Loan (or treated as cash due
to forgiveness of such Acquisition Loan indebtedness) shall be allocated
among the Employee Groups as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The allocation percentage for the Class
1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock released for that Plan Year shall be as follows:
ALPA Employee Group--31.759437%; IAM Employee Group--47.511196%; and Management
and Salaried Employee Group--20.729367%. All such shares released for such
Plan Year shall be allocated to the Employee Groups in accordance with
such allocation percentages.
<p>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There shall be calculated for each Participant
an allocation of shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock on account
of dividends paid during the Plan Year on such Preferred Stock previously
allocated to such Participant's ESOP Stock Account and applied in accordance
with Sections 10.1(a) and 10.3. The foregoing allocations for each Participant
shall be made out of the Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock allocated to
that Participant's Employee Group under subclause (A) above.
<p>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employer Contributions to be allocated in
accordance with this clause (i)(C) shall be allocated to each Employee
Group in the proportion that (x) shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock allocated to that respective Employee Group pursuant to subclause
(A) reduced by the shares allocated to members of that Employee Group pursuant
to subclause (B), bears to (y) all shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock released for the Plan Year reduced by all shares allocated pursuant
to subclause (B).
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the allocations
of Employer Contributions under clause (i)(C) shall be reduced by all of
the interest on the Initial Acquisition Loan and the Additional Acquisition
Loans paid during that period. Such reduction shall be made in proportion
to the allocations made under clause (i)(C).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, there shall
be tentatively allocated to the Accounts of each Participant in each Employee
Group that portion of the resulting Employer Contributions which such Participant's
Compensation (or, in the case of the [AM Employee Group, such Participant's
Wage Investments) for the Plan Year bears to the aggregate Compensation
(or, in the case of the IAM Employee Group. Wage Investments) for all such
Participants for such Plan Year; provided that such Employer Contributions
shall not be allocated to any Participant's Account to such extent the
allocation would exceed the limitation of Code section 415(c). The amount,
if any, by which the allocation to any such Participant's Account shall
be reduced under the foregoing proviso shall be, subject to the Code section
415(c) limitation, tentatively allocated (and, if necessary, reallocated)
to the Accounts of all other Participants in his Employee Group (x) for
the Management and Salaried Employee Group, in proportion to their Compensation,
(y) in the case of the IAM Employee Group, Wage Investments, and (z) in
the case of the ALPA Employee Group, first in proportion to (but not more
than) the amount of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock otherwise scheduled
for contribution and allocation to each Participant's Account under Part
B for the current Plan Year (absent this clause (iii)) and otherwise in
proportion to Compensation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, if the total
Employer Contributions tentatively allocated to "highly compensated employees"
(as defined in Code section 414(q)) under clause (iii) do not exceed one-third
of the total Employer Contributions tentatively allocated to the Accounts
of all Participants under clause (iii), the tentative allocations of Employer
Contributions to Participants shall become final. The foregoing limitation
shall be applied by aggregating all Participants in all Employee Groups.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, if the one-third
limitation described in clause (iv) is exceeded, the amount of Employer
Contributions allocated to Accounts of Participants in the ALPA Employee
Group who are highly compensated employees shall be reduced, pro rata,
based on Compensation and reallocated to Participants in the ALPA Employee
Group who are not highly compensated employees, to the extent necessary
to meet the one-third limitation described in clause (iv), subject, however,
to Code section 415(c). The foregoing reallocations to each non-highly
compensated employee shall be allocated in proportion to (but not more
than) the number of shares of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock otherwise
scheduled for contribution and allocation to his Account under Part B for
the current Plan Year (absent this clause (v)). If and to the extent appropriate
arrangements are made between the Company and ALPA to protect the interests
of the ALPA Employee Group (which arrangements shall be consistent with
Section 13.1 and which the Company agrees to do upon reasonable request
and which shall not require IAM consent), contributions for the highly
compensated ALPA Employee Group members may be reduced, pro rat.T, to meet
the one- third limitation described in clause (iv).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, if, after the
reallocation of Employer Contributions described in clause (v), the one-third
limitation described in clause (iv) is still exceeded, then the computations
described in foregoing clauses (i) through (v) shall be disregarded. In
lieu thereof the allocation shall be made in accordance with clauses (i)
through (iii), but clause (ii) shall be disregarded. If such allocations
do not result in a violation of Code section 415(c) for all members of
any Employee Group, the tentative allocations shall become final.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventh, if the allocation
of Employer Contributions described in clause (vi) results in a violation
of Code section 415(c) for all members of any Employee Group (after reallocating
any excess allocations owing to members of such Employee Group), then clause
(vi) shall be disregarded. The computations described in foregoing clauses
(i) through (v) (including clause (ii)) shall be repeated, but, after applying
clause (v), the amount of Employer Contributions allocated to Accounts
of Participants who are members of the Management and Salaried Employee
Group who are highly compensated employees shall be reduced, pro rata,
based on Compensation, and reallocated to Participants in the Management
and Salaried Employee Group who are not highly compensated employees, pro
rata, based on Compensation, to the extent necessary to meet the one- third
limitation described in clause (iv), subject, however, to Code section
415(c). In making the foregoing reallocations, no non-highly compensated
employee shall be allocated more shares under this clause (vii) than the
number of shares of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock otherwise scheduled
for contribution and allocation to his Account under Part B for the current
Plan Year (absent this clause (vii)). If and to the extent appropriate
arrangements are made by the Company to protect the interests of the Management
and Salaried Employee Group (which arrangements shall be consistent with
Section 13.1 and which shall not require IAM consent, but which shall require
ALPA consent. which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), contributions
for the highly compensated Management and Salaried Employee Group members
may be reduced, pro rata, to meet the one-third limitation described in
clause (iv).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eighth, all shares
of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock released from the Loan Suspense Account
as of the Valuation Date shall be allocated first in respect of dividends
paid on previously allocated shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Stock in accordance
with Sections 10.1(a)(i) and 10.3 and then allocated in proportion to the
percentage of the Employer Contributions allocated to each Participant's
Account under clauses (i) through (vii) above.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Contributions to Part B.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The special Employer
Contribution made by the Company on the Effective Date pursuant to Section
3.1(b)(i) shall be allocated, per capita, to the appropriate Participants'
ESOP Stock Accounts under Part B on the Effective Date.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employer Contributions
made in cash for the Plan Year under Section 3.1(b)(iii) shall be allocated
under Part B and credited to the ESOP Cash Accounts of the appropriate
Participants to which those cash contributions relate, as follows: to the
extent that the calculation of the amount of such contributions refers
to shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock held in the Loan Suspense
Account or Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock contemplated for further
sale, divide such cash contributions among the Employee Groups in accordance
with Section 5.4(a)(i)(A); to the extent it refers to shares of Class 1
Non-Voting Preferred Stock allocated to the Participants' ESOP Stock Accounts,
apportion those contributions to the relevant Employee Group; then, allocate
to the appropriate Participants' Accounts, pro rata, in the case of (i)
the ALPA Employee Group and the Management and Salaried Employee Group,
according to the Compensation paid to such Participants for the Plan Year,
and (ii) the IAM Employee Group, according to Wage Investments made by
such Participants for the Plan Year; subject, however, in all cases to
Code section 415(c).
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular Contributions to Part B. Shares
of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock and Voting Preferred Stock contributed
to the Plan pursuant to Section 3.1(b) shall be allocated among and credited
to the ESOP Stock Accounts of Participants for that Plan Year as set forth
below, provided, however, that no allocations (other than allocations under
clauses (i) and (viii) below) shall be made to Accounts of Participants
who are members of the IAM Employee Group:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, subject to the
applicable Code limitations, one share of Voting Preferred Stock shall
be allocated to the Participant's Account for each share of Class 1 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock allocated to that Participant under Part A on that Valuation
Date. The shares of Voting Preferred Stock shall be allocated under Part
B and shall be of the appropriate class for each such Participant. The
special allocation under Section 5.4(b)(i) shall be credited against the
allocation required pursuant to this clause (i) on the first Valuation
Date.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, for each Participant,
a "hypothetical share number" shall be calculated for the Valuation Date.
Such number shall equal the number of shares that would have been allocated
to the Participant under Part A on such Valuation Date if (A) all the shares
of Class 1 and Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant
to the Recapitalization Agreement (including, with respect to Valuation
Dates occurring on or after December 31, 1995 and after the allocation
in subsection (viii) be low, any Additional Shares issued or to be issued)
had been (I) purchased by the Trust under a single loan on the Effective
Date and held under the Loan Suspense Account pursuant to Part A, and (II)
in the case of such Class 2 shares, considered Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock under Part A having the same fair market value as the Class 1 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock; provided, however, that such Class 2 shares shall not,
except as provided in subclause (E), bear any dividend; (B) the shares
of Class 1 and Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock were released under Part
A ratably over the 69 months starting on the Effective Date; (C) Section
5.4(a)(i)(A) were applied by allocating the Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock and the Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock among the Employee Groups
as follows: ALPA Employee Group - 46.23%; IAM Employee Group - 37.13%;
and Management and Salaried Employee Group - 16.64%; (D) allocations under
Part A were made as if: (I) the limitations of Code sections 401(a)(4),
401(a)(17) and 415 did not apply; (II) Compensation was based on "compensation"
as defined in the Supplemental Plan and (III) clauses (ii), (iv), (v),
(vi) and (vii) of Section 5.4(a) did not apply; and (E) each share of Class
2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock that was in fact allocated on a prior Valuation
Date to a Participant's account under the Supplemental Plan or under Part
B shall, after the date of such allocation, be considered Class 1 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock held by Part A (bearing the same Fixed Dividend as the
Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock that was allocated under Part A (but
not bearing any other dividend)). By way of illustration, assume a member
of the ALPA Employee Group has a total of 130 shares of Class 2 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock allocated to his account under the Supplemental Plan and
70 shares of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock allocated to his Account
under Part B. Assume further that each share of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock under Part A has a value of $100, pays an $8 Fixed Dividend, no dividends
are paid on Common Stock and that each share of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock has a $75 value. For purposes of making the allocations under this
subclause (E), such individual shall be treated as having received a dividend
of $1600 with respect to the shares of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock
allocated under the Supplemental Plan and under Part B. For purposes of
calculating the hypothetical share number, that individual shall receive
an allocation of 16 shares of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock to make
up for such dividend, notwithstanding the fact that the value of the shares
of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock is S75 per share.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, for each ESOP
Participant, the "actual share number" for a Valuation Date shall be the
actual number of shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock that are
allocated to such Participant under Part A on that Valuation Date.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, for each ESOP
Participant, the excess of the hypothetical share number over the actual
share number shall be referred to herein as the respective "tentative allocation."
If the sum of the tentative allocations (ignoring negative tentative allocations)
for all Participants in an Employee Group exceeds the number of shares
of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock released from the "phantom suspense
account" to all such Participants' accounts for that Employee Group under
Section 2.2 of the Supplemental Plan, each such tentative allocation for
Participants of that Employee Group shall be proportionately reduced.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, on each Valuation
Date, the number of shares of each of the Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock and Voting Preferred Stock, if any, to be allocated to a Participant
under Part B (excluding Voting Preferred Stock described in Section 5.4(c)(i)
and 5.4(c)(vi)) shall be the same and shall equal the least of the following
numbers: (A) the maximum number of shares of each of the Class 2 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock and the Voting Preferred Stock that can be allocated to
the Participant for the Valuation Date under Part B without violating Code
section 415 or Code section 401(a)(4) (if applicable), (B) the tentative
allocation and (C) the excess of the hypothetical share number (calculated
for this purpose only by applying the Code section 401(a)(17) limitation)
over the actual share number. The hypothetical share number described in
this subclause (C) shall be determined by recalculating the allocations
made on the current and all prior Valuation Dates by assuming the Participant's
Compensation for each Plan Year had been limited to the amount then allowed
und7er Code section 401(a)(17). Accordingly, for purposes of calculating
the hypothetical share number under this subclause (C), the Participants'
Compensation in the current Plan Year shall be limited to the amount provided
by Code section 401(a)(17) and the amount of dividends allocated to each
Participant's Account during the Plan Year shall be calculated by assuming
the allocations of shares made on earlier Valuation Dates were also based
on Compensation, as limited by Code section 401(a)(17) limitation then
in effect. The excess of the tentative allocations over the amount allocated
under clause (v) shall not be allocated under Part B, but shall be allocated
in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Plan.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, on the last Valuation
Date of each Plan Year, in addition to the shares of Class 2 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock and Voting Preferred Stock transferred to Part B under
clause (v) above, shares credited under the Supplemental Plan, in a prior
Plan Year, due to the limitations under Code section 401(a)(4), 401(a)(17)
or Code section 415, shall be allocated to Participants' Accounts under
Part B, subject to applicable Code limitations in accordance with the following
priorities:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first, by a number of shares, if any,
of Voting Preferred Stock equal to the excess of the number of shares of
Class 1 and Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock allocated to his Account
over the number of shares of Voting Preferred Stock allocated to his Account,
to the extent such number may be contributed by the Company or transferred
from the Supplemental Trust to Part B without disqualifying the Plan or
any other qualified plan; provided, however, that the number of shares
transferred may include any shares that were not previously contributed
or transferred to Part B because of the limitations of Code section 401(a)(17);
<p>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; second, by the maximum number of shares
of Class 2 NonVoting Preferred Stock and Voting Preferred Stock (such numbers
to be the same) that may be contributed by the Company (or transferred
from the Supplemental Trust) to Part B without disqualifying the Plan or
any other qualified plan; provided, however, that the number of shares
transferred may include any shares that were not previously contributed
or transferred to Part B because of the limitations of Code section 401(a)(17);
and
<p>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; third, by the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock that may be transferred from the Supplemental Trust to Part
B without disqualifying the Plan or any other qualified plan; provided,
however, that the number of shares may include any shares that were not
previously contributed or transferred to Part B because of the limitations
of Code section 401(a)(17).</dir>
</dir>
The reductions described in subclauses (A) through (C) shall not include
any Voting Preferred Stock, Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock or Common
Stock allocated during the current Plan Year.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventh, the Company
shall contribute (or, to the extent applicable, the Company shall direct
the trustee of the Supplemental Trust to transfer) a number of shares of
Voting Preferred Stock and Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock and Common
Stock equal to the sum of the number of such respective shares calculated
for each Participant under clauses (i), (v) and (vi) above to Part B. Such
shares shall be transferred as soon as practicable after the applicable
Valuation Date.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eighth, Prior to the
December 31, 1995 Valuation Date, the aggregate hypothetical share numbers
for all Participants for the 1994 Plan Year shall be retroactively increased
by an additional number equal to X multiplied by Y, where X is the total
number of shares of Preferred Stock to be issued as Additional Shares and
Y is the release fraction (as defined in the Supplemental Plan) for December
31, 1994. Such shares shall be divided among the Employee Groups (including
the IAM Employee Group) in accordance with Section 5.4(c)(ii)(C) and allocated
to Participants based upon 1994 data (that is, 1994 Compensation and Wage
Investments, as applicable.) The excess of such new hypothetical share
number (including such numbers for the IAM Employee Group) for the 1994
Plan Year over the hypothetical share number previously determined for
1994 shall be allocated hereunder or credited under the Supplemental Plan
in accordance with clause (v) above, provided that the number in (v)(A)
shall be calculated and credited as if the contributions were attributable
to 1995, rather than 1994, unless the additional shares calculated in clause
(v) to be contributed to ESOP (Part B) are in fact contributed to the ESOP
no later than September 15, 1995. The calculations required by this clause
(viii) shall be performed prior to calculating the regular allocations
for the 1995 year. The additional shares of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock credited pursuant to this clause (viii) shall, for all purposes,
including Section 5.4(c)(ii)(E), be allocated as of December 31, 1994.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose. The purpose of the foregoing contribution
and allocation provisions is to place each Participant, to the extent possible,
in the same position such Participant would have been if (i) Code sections
401(a)(4), 401(a)(17) and 415 did not apply, (ii) all of the shares of
Preferred Stock to be sold to Part A during the Wage Investment Period
had instead been sold on the Effective Date, (iii) all of the shares (excluding
shares of the Voting Preferred Stock) contributed to Part B or credited
under the Supplemental Plan during the Wage Investment Period had instead
been purchased by the Trust on the Effective Date pursuant to Part A as
Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock and (iv) the Preferred Stock and Voting
Preferred Stock had been allocated ratably (over the 69 months beginning
at the Effective Date) to Participants in their respective Employee Groups
in accordance with the overall program ownership percentages, that is,
the ALPA Employee Group - 46.23%, the IAM Employee Group - 37.13% and the
Management and Salaried Employee Group - 16.64%. To the extent any interpretative
issues arise in calculating contributions and allocations, such issues
shall be resolved, if possible, by effectuating such purpose. To the extent
that any shares of Company Stock are converted into shares of Common Stock
prior to the end of the Wage Investment Period, an appropriate number of
shares of Common Stock will be contributed (if applicable) and allocated
hereunder in lieu of the shares of the Company Stock that would have been
contributed and/or allocated hereunder and, if appropriate, the number
of Class 1 and/or Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock shares set forth in
various places in this Plan shall be revised; provided, except to the extent
the shares of Voting Preferred Stock are converted into shares of Common
Stock, the calculation of the number of shares of Voting Preferred Stock
to be contributed and allocated shall continue as if no shares of Company
Stock had been converted.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Allocation Provision. For purposes
of making allocations under Section 5.4, the period from January 1, 2000
through April 12, 2000 shall be treated as a Plan Year (for the ALPA Employee
Group and the Management and Salaried Employee Group) and the period from
January 1, 2000 through July 12, 2000 shall be treated as a Plan Year (for
the IAM Employee Group).</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation on Allocations
to Participants.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General. Subject to the provisions of
this Section 5.5, Code section 415, including the effect of any transitional
rule, shall be incorporated by reference into the terms of the Plan. No
allocation shall be made under Section 5.4 that would result in a violation
of Code section 415.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code Section 415 Compensation. For purposes
of this Section 5.5, Compensation shall be adjusted to reflect the general
rule of Treasury Regulation section 1.415-2(d).
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation Year. The "limitation year" (within
the meaning of Code section 415) shall be the calendar year.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple Defined Contribution Plans. In
any case where a Participant also participates in another defined contribution
plan of the Company or its Affiliates, the appropriate committee of such
other plan shall first reduce the after-tax contributions under any such
plan, shall then reduce any elective deferrals under any such plan subject
to Code section 401(k), shall then reduce all other contributions under
any other such plan and, if necessary, shall then reduce contributions
under this Plan (Part B to be reduced before Part A); provided, however,
in the case of any Participant who is a member of the ALPA Employee Group,
contributions (excluding after-tax contributions and elective deferrals)
under the United Air Lines, Inc. Pilots' Directed Account Retirement Income
Plan shall be reduced last.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Plan Limitations. To the extent
necessary to comply with the requirements of Code section 415(e), the appropriate
committee shall first reduce the annual benefit payable under any defined
benefit plan in which the Participant participates and, if necessary, the
ESOP Committee shall thereafter reduce the contributions under the defined
contribution plans in which such Participant participates in accordance
with Section 5.5(d).
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excess Allocations. If, after applying the
allocation provisions under Section 5.4, allocations under Section 5.4
would otherwise result in a violation of Code section 415, the ESOP Committee
shall reduce Employer Contributions for the next limitation year for the
affected Participant or shall hold excess amounts in a suspense account
for allocation in a subsequent Plan Year in accordance with Reg. section
1.415-6(b)(6)(ii). Such suspense account, if permitted, will be created
before any reallocation of contributions for the affected individual. If
the limits of Code section 415 would cause total allocations to each Participant
in an Employee Group to exceed the permitted amount, appropriate arrangements
will be made to protect the interests of that Employee Group, consistent
with the principles of Section 3.2.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valuations. All valuations
of shares of Company Stock that are not readily tradeable on an established
securities market shall be valued by an "independent appraiser" (within
the meaning of Code section 170(a)(1)).
<center>
<p>SECTION 6
<p>Vesting</center>

<p>A Participant's Account shall be fully vested (nonforfeitable) at all
times, and will be distributed to him or, in the event of his death, to
his Beneficiary, in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section
7.

<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General. Any Participant who has attained
age 55 and has 10 years of participation under the Plan ("Qualified Participant")
may elect to diversify the investment of a portion of his Account under
this Section 7.1. During the six-Plan Year period beginning with the Plan
Year in which such Qualified Participant attains age 55 and has 10 years
of participation under the Plan, such Qualified Participant shall be entitled
to request, within 90 days after the close of each Plan Year in such period
(each such period referred to as an "Election Period"), the diversification
of up to 25% of the balance of his Account, to the extent such amount exceeds
the amount to which any prior election under this Section 7.1 applies.
During the last Election Period, the preceding sentence shall be applied
by substituting "50%" for "25%".
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amount. In the case of a Qualified Participant
who has made one or more elections during the period, the extent to which
a subsequent election exceeds the amount to which any prior election applies
shall be (i) in the case of the Qualified Participant's ESOP Cash Account,
(A) 25 % or 50 %, as the case may be, of the sum of the balance of such
Account as of the Valuation Date of the Plan Year with respect to which
the subsequent election is made and the amounts diversified pursuant to
prior elections, less (B) the amounts diversified pursuant to prior elections;
and (ii) in the case of the Qualified Participant's ESOP Stock Account,
(A) 25% or 50%, as the case may be, of the sum of the number of shares
of Company Stock in the Qualified Participant's ESOP Stock Account as of
the Valuation Date of the Plan Year with respect to which the subsequent
election is made and the number of shares of Company Stock diversified
pursuant to prior elections, less (B) the number of shares of Company Stock
diversified pursuant to prior elections. For the purposes of this Section
7, fractional shares for which a Qualified Participant might be entitled
to receive shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The diversification
of a Participant's Account under this Section 7.1 shall only be effected
within 90 days following the 90-day period in which the Qualified Participant
makes his request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the fair market value
of the Company Stock allocated to the ESOP Stock Accounts of a Qualified
Participant is $500 or less as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding
the first day of an Election Period, such Qualified Participant shall not
be entitled to an election under this Section 7.1 for that Election Period.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Method. A Participant's diversification
election pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall only be effected by having
the ESOP Committee cause the Trustee to transfer the portion of the Account
to be diversified to the Company's Code section 401(k) plan applicable
to such Participant. An equal number of shares of Voting Preferred Stock
and Preferred Stock shall be diversified.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distributions on Account
of Termination of Employment. Subject to the following provisions of this
Section 7, a Participant (or, in the case of a Participant's death, his
Beneficiary) shall become eligible (but shall not be required) to receive
a distribution of the balance of his Account, as of the Valuation Date
coincident with or next following the date the Participant's employment
with the Company and its Affiliates terminates for any reason, provided,
however, that, except as provided in Section 7.4, no distributions shall
be made prior to July 13, 1995.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manner and Form of Distributions.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manner. A Participant may elect to receive
a distribution of his Account balance in either of the following methods:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By payment in a lump
sum; or
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By payment in a series
of five substantially equal annual installments (to consist of equal numbers
of Voting Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock).
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
If a Participant so desires he may direct how his benefits are to be paid
to his Beneficiary. If a deceased Participant did not file a direction
with the ESOP Committee, the Beneficiary may elect to receive a distribution
of the Account in accordance with this Section 7.3.
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Form. At the Participant's election, the
ESOP Committee shall direct the Trustee to make distribution of a Participant's
Account in (i) cash, (ii) Company Stock or (iii) in cash equal to the amount
held in such Participant's ESOP Cash Account and in shares of Company Stock
with respect to such Participant's ESOP Stock Account; provided, however,
that Company Stock (if convertible) shall only be distributed in the form
of Common Stock received in the conversion of the Preferred Stock held
in his Account and any fractional share shall be paid in cash. If a Participant
elects to receive a distribution of his ESOP Stock Account in cash, the
Trustee shall be directed to convert (if convertible) the Company Stock
in his ESOP Stock Account into Common Stock and to sell the Common Stock
and any Company Stock that is not convertible; the amount of cash so distributed
shall equal the net proceeds received from the sale of such shares of Common
Stock. If a Participant elects to receive a distribution of his ESOP Cash
Account in Common Stock, the Trustee will be directed to purchase Common
Stock in the open market and the number of shares of Common Stock so distributed
shall equal the number of whole shares purchased with such Participants'
Account balance, with any excess cash distributed to the Participant.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Distribution Rules.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Required Distributions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a Participant whose employment
with the Company and its Affiliates terminates by reason of attainment
of his Normal Retirement Date, death or Total Disability must be eligible
to receive a distribution of his Account balance no later than the end
of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which such termination occurs;
provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to the shares of
Company Stock held in the Participant's Account acquired with the proceeds
of an Acquisition Loan until the close of the Plan Year in which such Acquisition
Loan has been repaid in full;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless a Participant
otherwise elects under Section 7.4(b), a Participant whose employment with
the Company and its Affiliates terminates must commence to receive a distribution
of his Account no later than 60 days following the close of the Plan Year
in which the latest of the following occurs; (A) a Participant reaches
his Normal Retirement Date, (B) the Participant's employment with the Company
and its Affiliates terminates and (C) the 10th anniversary of the year
in which the Participant commenced participation in the Plan;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a Participant's Account
balance must commence to be distributed no later than the April 1 of the
calendar year next following the calendar year in which such Participant
attains age 70-1/2. Any amount distributed pursuant to this clause (iii)
shall, in the case of a Participant who is an Employee, be and be limited
to the minimum amount required to be distributed pursuant to Code section
401(a)(9);
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a Participant's employment
with the Company and its Affiliates terminates by reason of death, or if
a Participant dies after his employment terminates but before a distribution
commences from the Plan, then, unless the Participant's spouse is the Beneficiary,
all of the Participant's interest in the Plan must be completely distributed
within five years after the date of his death unless distributions begin
within one year after the Participant's death; and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the extent permitted
by law, Code section 40 1 (a)(9) and any related transitional rule are
incorporated by reference into the terms of the Plan.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deferred Distributions. A Participant (or
a spousal Beneficiary) may elect to defer the commencement of his distribution
to any date on or prior to the April I of the calendar year next following
the calendar year in which such Participant attains age 70-1/2.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct Rollover. To the
extent required by Code section 401(a)(31), the Participant (or a spousal
Beneficiary) shall have the right to elect to have any distribution that
constitutes an "eligible rollover distribution" (as defined in Code section
401(a)(31)(C)) paid directly to an "eligible retirement plan" (as defined
in Code section 401(a)(31)(D)) specified by such Participant (or a spousal
Beneficiary). If a Participant (or a spousal Beneficiary) fails to make
the foregoing election he shall be deemed to have not made such election.
The provisions of this Section 7.5 shall be administered in accordance
with, and subject to, such rules as the ESOP Committee may prescribe, which
rules may include any limitations permitted under Code section 401(a)(31).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facility of Payment.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General. Subject to Section 7.6(b), if,
in the opinion of the ESOP Committee, a Participant or Beneficiary is under
a legal disability or is in any way incapacitated so as to be unable to
manage his financial affairs, the ESOP Committee may (but shall not be
required to), until claim is made by a conservator or other person legally
charged with the care of his person or of his estate, direct the Trustee
to make payment to a relative or friend of such person for his benefit.
Thereafter, any benefits under the Plan to which such Participant or Beneficiary
is entitled shall be paid to such conservator or other person legally charged
with the care of his person or his estate.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minors. In the event
any amount is payable under the Plan to a minor, payment shall not be made
to the minor, but instead shall be paid (i) to that person's then living
parent(s) to act as custodian, (ii) if that person's parents are then divorced,
and one parent is the sole custodial parent, to such custodial parent,
or (iii) if no parent of that person is then living, to a custodian selected
by the ESOP Committee to hold the funds for the minor under the Uniform
Transfers or Gifts to Minors Act in effect in the jurisdiction in which
the minor resides. If no parent is living and the ESOP Committee decides
not to select another custodian to hold the funds for the minor, payment
shall be made to the duly appointed and currently acting guardian of the
estate for the minor or, if no guardian of the estate for the minor is
duly appointed and currently acting within 60 days after the date the amount
becomes payable, payment shall be deposited with the court having jurisdiction
over the estate of the minor.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discharge. Any payment
made under this Section 7.6 shall fully discharge, to such extent, the
obligation of the Trustee to pay benefits under the Plan with respect to
such Participant, Beneficiary or minor.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interests Not Transferable.
The interests of Participants and their Beneficiaries under the Plan are
not subject to the claims of their creditors and may not be voluntarily
or involuntarily assigned, alienated or encumbered, except as otherwise
provided in Section 7.11.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absence of Guaranty.
The Trustee, the ESOP Committee and the Employers in no way guarantee the
Trust Fund from loss or depreciation. Moreover, the Employers do not guarantee
any payment to any person. The liability of the Trust to make any payment
is limited to the available Trust Fund.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designation of Beneficiary.
In the event of the death of a married Participant, the Participant's Account
balance will be paid to his surviving spouse, except as otherwise provided
below. Each Participant from time to time, by signing a form furnished
by the ESOP Committee, may designate any legal or natural person or persons
(who may be designated contingently or successively) to whom his benefits
are to be paid if he dies before he receives all of his benefits; provided,
however, that if a married Participant designates a Beneficiary other than
his spouse, his spouse must consent in writing to such designation and
acknowledge in writing the effect of such designation, and such consent
and acknowledgement must be witnessed by a notary public. Any designation
by an unmarried Participant shall be rendered ineffective by any subsequent
marriage and any consent of a spouse shall be effective only as to that
spouse.
<p>A Beneficiary designation form will be effective only when the signed
form is filed with the ESOP Committee while the Participant is alive and
will cancel all Beneficiary designation forms signed earlier. If a deceased
Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above (or if the
designated Beneficiary dies before the Participant or before receiving
complete payment of the Participant's benefits), the ESOP Committee shall
direct the Trustee to pay the Participant's benefits as follows:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first, to the surviving spouse of the
Participant, if any;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; second, to the children (including any adopted
children) of the Participant, per stirpes; and
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; third, if the Participant leaves no surviving
spouse or has no descendants pursuant to paragraph (b) above, to the estate
of the last to die of the Participant or his designated Beneficiary.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
Upon the dissolution of marriage of a Participant, any designation of the
Participant's former spouse as a Beneficiary shall be treated as though
the Participant's former spouse had predeceased the Participant, unless
(i) the Participant executes another Beneficiary designation that complies
with this Section 7.9 and that clearly names such former spouse as a Beneficiary,
or (ii) a court order presented to the ESOP Committee prior to distribution
on behalf of the Participant explicitly requires the Participant to continue
to maintain the former spouse as the Beneficiary. In any case in which
the Participant's former spouse is treated under the Participant's Beneficiary
designation as having predeceased the Participant, no heirs or other beneficiaries
of the former spouse shall receive benefits from the Plan as a Beneficiary
of the Participant except as provided otherwise in the Participant's Beneficiary
designation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Missing Participants
or Beneficiaries. Each Participant and each Beneficiary must file with
the ESOP Committee from time to time in writing his post office address
and each change of post office address. Any communication, statement or
notice addressed to a Participant or Beneficiary at his last post office
address filed with the ESOP Committee, or if no address is filed with the
ESOP Committee, then, in the case of a Participant, at his last post office
address as shown on his Employer's records, will be binding on the Participant
and his Beneficiary for all purposes of the Plan. The Employers, the ESOP
Committee and the Trustee will not be required to search for or locate
a Participant or his Beneficiary. In the event that all, or any portion,
of the distribution payable to a Participant or his Beneficiary hereunder
shall, at the expiration of five years after it shall become payable, remain
unpaid solely by reason of the inability of the ESOP Committee, after sending
a communication, statement or notice to the last post office address filed
with the ESOP Committee, to ascertain the whereabouts of such Participant
or his Beneficiary, the amount so distributable shall be reallocated in
the same manner as a Company Stock contribution would be allocated under
the provisions of Section 5.4. In the event a Participant or his Beneficiary
is located subsequent to his benefit being reallocated, such benefit shall
be restored first from Trust (including the Supplemental Trust) earnings
and second from an Employer Contribution made solely for restoration purposes.
The allocation and restoration referred to above shall be effected by giving
effect to the class of Company Stock reallocated.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualified Domestic Relations
Order. In addition to payments made under Section 7 on account of a Participant's
termination of employment, payments may also be made to an Alternate Payee
(as defined below) prior to, coincident with, or after a Participant's
termination of employment if made pursuant to a "qualified domestic relations
order" (as defined in Code section 414(p)). The ESOP Committee shall establish
reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations
orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders, including,
in its sole discretion, the establishment of segregated accounts for Alternate
Payees. The term "Alternate Payee" means any spouse, former spouse, child
or other dependent of a Participant who is recognized by a Qualified Domestic
Relations Order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the
benefits payable under the Plan with respect to the Participant.

<p>SECTION 8
<p>Voting and Certain Dispositions of Company Stock</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voting.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocated Shares. Each Participant or
Beneficiary, as a named fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA section 403(a)(1),
in accordance with the procedures hereinafter set forth, may direct the
Trustee with respect to the votes of the shares of Company Stock allocated
to his ESOP Stock Account, and the Trustee shall follow the directions
of those Participants (and Beneficiaries) who provide timely instructions
to the Trustee; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee
shall vote the shares of Company Stock allocated to the Part B Accounts
of Participants who are (or were) members of the ALPA Employee Group but
are not Employees (or allocated to the Part B Accounts of their Beneficiaries).
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unallocated and Uninstructed Shares.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part A. Each active Participant
(which shall be defined for purposes of Sections 8.1 and 8.2 to mean a
Participant who is an Employee) who directed the Trustee with respect to
shares allocated to his Account under Part A in accordance with Section
8.1(a) may, again as a named fiduciary, direct the Trustee with respect
to a portion of both the number of shares of Company Stock held in the
Loan Suspense Account and the number of such shares allocated to any Participant's
Account under Part A for which no instructions were timely, received by
the Trustee. Such portion shall be determined as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such portion shall be limited to the sum
of: (I) the number of shares of Company Stock held in the Loan Suspense
Account reserved for allocation to such Participant's Employee Group, plus
(II) the number of shares of Company Stock allocated to the Accounts of
Participants in such Participant's Employee Group under Part A for which
no instructions were timely received.
<p>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of shares of Company Stock determined
under clause (i)(A) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of shares of Company Stock allocable to Part A that
such Participant directed the Trustee in accordance with Section 8.1(a)
and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares allocable
to Part A that were directed by active Participants in the same Employee
Group in accordance with Section 8.1(a).
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such Participant, as a named fiduciary, shall
be entitled to direct the Trustee with respect to the number of shares
determined under clause (i)(B).
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part B. Each active Participant who directed
the Trustee with respect to shares allocated to his Account under Part
B in accordance with Section 8.1(a) may, again as a named fiduciary, direct
the Trustee with respect to a portion of the number of such shares allocated
to any Participant's Account under Part B for which no instructions were
timely received by the Trustee. Such portion shall be determined as follows:
<dir>
<dir>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such portion shall be limited to the number
of shares of Company Stock allocated to the Accounts of Participants in
such Participant's Employee Group under Part B for which no instructions
were timely received.
<p>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of shares of Company Stock determined
under clause (ii)(A) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of shares of Company Stock allocable to Part B that
such Participant directed the Trustee in accordance with Section 8.1(a)
and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares allocable
to Part B that were directed by active Participants in the same Employee
Group in accordance with Section 8.1(a).
<p>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such Participant, as a named fiduciary,
shall be entitled to direct the Trustee, with respect to the number of
shares determined under clause (ii)(B).
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procedure. Such directions shall be provided
directly to the Trustee and shall be held in confidence and not be divulged
or released to any other person. Within a reasonable time prior to each
annual or special meeting of holders of Company Stock, the ESOP Committee
shall furnish to all Participants (and Beneficiaries) entitled to direct
the Trustee as to the voting of shares of Company Stock copies of any proxy
solicitation material provided to holders of voting Company Stock generally
together with appropriate instruction forms or cards and information concerning
the method of providing such instructions to the Trustee. To the extent
permitted by law, if the Trustee cannot follow directions of Participants
(or Beneficiaries), the ESOP Committee shall direct the Trustee.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Transaction.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General. The provisions of this Section
8.2 shall apply in the event a Control Transaction is commenced or proposed
by a person or persons. In the event a Control Transaction is commenced
or proposed, the ESOP Committee, promptly after receiving notice, shall
transfer certain of the ESOP Committee's record keeping functions under
the Plan to an independent record keeper (which if the Trustee consents
in writing, may be the Trustee). The functions so transferred shall be
those necessary to preserve the confidentiality of any directions given
by the Participants (and Beneficiaries) 'in connection with the Control
Transaction. Within a reasonable time after a Control Transaction is commenced,
the ESOP Committee shall furnish to all Participants (and Beneficiaries)
entitled, as hereinafter set forth, to direct the Trustee with respect
to the Control Transaction, copies of all offering material provided to
holders of Company Stock generally, together with appropriate instruction
forms or cards and information concerning the method of providing such
instructions to the Trustee. Except as otherwise required by ERISA, the
Trustee shall have no discretion or authority to sell, exchange, transfer,
convert or otherwise dispose of any of shares of Company Stock pursuant
to such Control Transaction except to the extent that the Trustee is timely
directed to do so in writing as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocated Shares. Each
Participant (or Beneficiary) to whose ESOP Stock Account shares of Company
Stock have been allocated may, as a named fiduciary within the meaning
of ERISA section 403(a)(1), direct the Trustee with respect to the sale,
exchange, transfer, conversion or other disposition of the shares of Company
Stock allocated to his ESOP Stock Account, and the Trustee shall follow
the directions of those Participants (and Beneficiaries) who provide timely
instructions to the Trustee.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unallocated and Uninstructed
Shares.
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part A. Each active Participant who directed
the Trustee with respect to shares allocated to his Account under Part
A in accordance with Section 8.2(a)(i) may, again as a named fiduciary,
direct the Trustee with respect to a portion of both the number of shares
of Company Stock held in the Loan Suspense Account and the number of such
shares allocated to any Participant's Account under Part A for which no
instructions were timely received by the Trustee. Such portion shall be
determined as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such portion shall be limited to the sum
of: (x) the number of shares of Company Stock held in the Loan Suspense
Account reserved for allocation to such Participant's Employee Group, plus
(y) the number of shares of Company Stock allocated to the Accounts of
Participants in such Participant's Employee Group under Part A for which
no instructions were timely received.
<p>(II)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of shares of Company Stock determined
under clause (ii)(A)(I) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of shares of Company Stock allocable to Part A that
such Participant directed the Trustee in accordance with Section 8.2(a)(i)
and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares allocable
to Part A that were directed by active Participants in the same Employee
Group in accordance with Section 8.2(a)(i).
<p>(III)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such Participant, as a named fiduciary,
shall be entitled to direct the Trustee with respect to the number of shares
determined under clause (ii)(A)(11).
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part B. Each active Participant who directed
the Trustee with respect to shares allocated to his Account under Part
B in accordance with Section 8.2(a)(i) may, again as a named fiduciary,
direct the Trustee with respect to a portion of the number of such shares
allocated to any Participant's Account under Part B for which no instructions
were timely received by the Trustee. Such portion shall be determined as
follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such portion shall be limited to the number
of shares of Company Stock allocated to the Accounts of Participants in
such Participant's Employee Group under Part B for which no instructions
were timely received.
<p>(II)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of shares of Company Stock determined
under clause (ii)(B)(1) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of shares of Company Stock allocable to Part B that
such Participant directed the Trustee in accordance with Section 8.2(a)(i)
and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares allocable
to Part B that were directed by active Participants in the same Employee
Group in accordance with Section 8.2(a)(i).
<p>(III)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such Participant, as a named fiduciary,
shall be entitled to direct the Trustee with respect to the number of shares
determined under clause (ii)(B)(II).
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
All such instructions from Participants (and beneficiaries) shall be provided
directly to the independent record keeper which, if different from the
Trustee, shall then instruct the Trustee as to the amount of shares to
be sold, tendered, exchanged, transferred, converted or otherwise disposed
of in accordance with the above directions. To the extent the Trustee cannot
follow Participant (or Beneficiary) instructions, the ESOP Committee, as
a named fiduciary, shall direct the Trustee. Except as contemplated by
the foregoing or as required to facilitate the making of Plan distributions
or diversification elections or as required by law, the Trustee shall have
no authority to dispose of Company Stock in a Control Transaction or otherwise.
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Records. Following any Control Transaction
that has resulted in the sale or exchange of any shares of Company Stock
held in the Plan, the record keeper shall continue to maintain on a confidential
basis the Accounts of Participants (and Beneficiaries) to whose Accounts
shares of Company Stock were allocated at any time during such offer, until
complete distribution of such Accounts or such earlier time as the record
keeper determines that the transfer of the record keeping functions back
to the ESOP Committee will not violate the confidentiality of the directions
given by the Participants (and Beneficiaries). In the event that there
is no sale or exchange of any shares of ESOP Stock held in the Plan pursuant
to the Control Transaction, the record keeper shall transfer back to the
ESOP Committee the record keeping functions; provided, however, that the
record keeper shall keep confidential any instructions which it may receive
from Participants (and Beneficiaries) relating to the Control Transaction.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proceeds. For purposes of allocating the
proceeds of any sale or exchange pursuant to a Control Transaction, the
ESOP Committee or the independent record keeper, as the case may be, shall
determine the portion, expressed as a percentage, of shares of each class
tendered by the Trustee that were actually sold or exchanged (the "applicable
percentage" for that class). For each class, the ESOP Committee or the
independent record keeper, as the case may be, shall then treat as having
been sold or exchanged from the portion of the Loan Suspense Account applicable
to that Employee Group and each of the individual Accounts of Participants
(and Beneficiaries) that number of shares (of that class) that is obtained
by multiplying (i) the applicable percentage for that class, times (ii)
the total number of shares in such Account of that class that were directed
to be tendered, exchanged or sold in connection with the Control Transaction.
The adjustments to individual Accounts shall be made by the ESOP Committee
or the independent record keeper, as the case may be, on information supplied
by the Company, the ESOP Committee or the Trustee.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actions To Be Taken Following a Control
Transaction. Notwithstanding Section 4.2 or any other provision of this
Plan or the Trust Agreement that requires that the Trust Fund be invested
exclusively in shares of Company Stock, this Section 8.2(d) shall apply
if a Control Transaction results in the sale or exchange or other disposition
of any shares of Company Stock held in the Plan. If the consideration received
by the Trust as a result of the Control Transaction consists solely of
"appropriate securities" (as defined below), the terms of the Plan, all
outstanding Acquisition Loans, and future sales under Additional Acquisition
Loans, shall continue as if the Control Transaction had not occurred. If
the consideration received includes cash, property or securities, other
than appropriate securities, the Trustee shall invest the proceeds in appropriate
securities to the extent possible; if the Trustee is able to reinvest all
such proceeds in appropriate securities, the Plan, all outstanding Acquisition
Loan and future sales under Additional Acquisition Loans, shall continue
as if the Control Transaction had not occurred; if the Trustee is unable
to reinvest all such proceeds in appropriate securities, then the Company
shall make appropriate arrangements (which shall be reasonably satisfactory
to ALPA and the IAM and shall take into account and recognize the position
that ESOP Participants would have enjoyed had all of the shares of Class
1 Non-Voting Stock been sold to the ESOP on the Effective Date at a price
per share equal to the purchase price with respect to the shares sold on
the Effective Date) to protect the substantive interests of each Employee
Group, provided, however, that it is not currently intended that such arrangements
will consist of forgiveness of any portion of any Acquisition Loan. For
purposes of this Section 8.2(d), "appropriate securities" shall mean stock
(i) that is described in Code section 409(1), (ii) that is either common
stock described in Code section 409 (1)(1) or preferred stock that converts
into such common stock, and (iii) the issuer of which stock (A) has a Moody's
senior long-term debt rating which is at least as good as the better of
the Moody's senior long-term debt rating of the Company or United Airlines,
Inc. at such time and (B) is a "public company" as defined in Article Fifth
of the Articles of Incorporation of the Company.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Funding Rules. (i) If (x) any person
or persons commence (which, for purposes of this paragraph, shall mean-filing
a tender offer statement on Schedule 14D-1 (or successor form) with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or mailing appropriate solicitation
materials to the shareholders) a bona fide tender offer or exchange offer
for Company Stock which, if successful, would require the offeror (if a
person other than the Company or any of its affiliates) to file a Form
13D (or successor form) with the Securities and Exchange Commission with
respect thereto, or (y) the Board of Directors or shareholders approve
a Control Transaction described in Section 1(q)(b), then all of the remaining
shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock that are to be issued to the
Plan pursuant to the Recapitalization Agreement shall be sold ("Top-Off
Sale") by the Company to the Plan as soon as possible (and, in all circumstances,
in adequate time to allow the Plan to respond to such event), pursuant
to an Additional Acquisition Loan (conforming to the first sentence of
Section 1.6(g) of the Recapitalization Agreement, provided that the consent
of ALPA and the IAM required by that sentence shall not apply), unless
and to the extent that ALPA and the IAM jointly request otherwise in writing.
(All disputes between the Company and ALPA and the IAM as to whether any
such tender offer or exchange offer is bona fide shall be made in accordance
with the arbitration procedures described in Section 11.2(b)(ii)(G)-(J)
hereof.) In the Company's sole discretion such Top-Off Sale may be made
subject to a Condition that prevents, to the extent permitted by law, the
consummation of such Top-Off Sale if the event in question does not result
in the sale, exchange or other disposition of Company Stock, provided that
such contingency does not materially interfere with the Plan's ability
to so respond to the event in question. The purchase price of the shares
of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock to be sold pursuant to this subsection
(e) shall be the fair market value of such shares of Class 1 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a person or persons
make a bona fide offer to the Plan (not covered by paragraph (e)(i)) to
acquire, directly or indirectly, at least 5% of the Company Stock held
by the Plan (the "Offer"), such Offer shall be treated as if an event described
in (e)(i) and the resultant Top- Off Sale shall be effected in accordance
with (e)(i), subject, however, to the provisions of (e)(11)(B).
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of an Offer, the Trustee
shall seek directions from Participants regarding the Offer, in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.2, both as to the actual shares held
by the Plan and as to the additional shares that would be held in the Loan
Suspense Account if the Top-Off Sale had been effected. If following those
directions as to both actual shares and the shares that would be acquired
in a Top-Off Sale, and following those directions only as to actual shares
would in each case not result in the direct or indirect acquisition of
any Company Stock pursuant to the Offer, then the Top-Off Sale shall not
be effected; otherwise, the Top-Off Sale shall be effected as contemplated
by (e)(i) and (e)(ii)(A).
<p>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the next sentence, the provisions
of (e)(ii)(B) shall not apply and the Top-Off Sale shall be made in accordance
with (e)(ii)(A) if following the (e)(ii)(B) procedures could reasonably
be expected to prevent a Top-Off Sale from being effected in adequate time
to allow the Plan to accept the Offer. Under the circumstances described
in this (e)(ii)(C), however, the Top-Off Sale shall be consummated immediately
before the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Offer and
shall, to the extent legally permitted, be subject to the consummation
of the transaction contemplated by the Offer.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a Top-Off Sale required by (e)(i) or (e)(ii)
is not consummated, the Company shall make appropriate arrangements (which
shall be reasonably satisfactory to ALPA and the IAM) to protect the substantive
interests of the Employee Groups with respect to the ESOP and the relevant
transaction and the purposes of this subsection (e). The appropriate arrangements
contemplated by the foregoing shall take into account and recognize the
position that Participants would have enjoyed had all of the shares of
Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock been sold to the Plan on the Effective
Date at a price per share equal to the purchase price with respect to the
shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock sold on the Effective Date.
The provisions of this subsection (e) and subsection (d) are not mutually
exclusive, provided that to the extent the sales or other appropriate arrangements
described in this subsection (e) occur, the future sales in connection
with Additional Acquisition Loans described in subsection (d) shall not
be required.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Illegal Actions. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Plan, the Trustee shall not be obligated to
follow the direction of a named fiduciary unless such direction is in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and is proper under ERISA section 403(a)(2)
and not contrary to Title I of ERISA.

<p>SECTION 9
<p>Rights, Restrictions and Options on Company Stock</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right of First Refusal.
If Company Stock distributed is not readily tradable on an established
market (within the meaning of Code section 409(h)), any shares of Company
Stock distributed by the Trustee shall be subject to a "Right of First
Refusal." The Right of First Refusal shall provide that, prior to any subsequent
transfer, such shares of Company Stock must first be offered in writing
to the Trust and, if refused by the Trust, to the Company, at the greater
of its independently appraised value as of the Valuation Date coinciding
with or next preceding such offer, or the price stated in a bona fide written
offer and on the same terms. The Trustee (on behalf of the Trust) and the
Company, as the case may be, shall have a total of 14 days (from the date
the Trust or the Company, as the case may be, receives the offer) to exercise
the Right of First Refusal. The ESOP Committee shall determine whether
a written offer from a prospective buyer has been made in good faith. A
Participant (or Beneficiary) entitled to a distribution of Company Stock
may be required to execute an appropriate stock transfer agreement (evidencing
the Right of First Refusal) prior to receiving a certificate for Company
Stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put Option. If Company
Stock distributed is not readily tradable on an established market (within
the meaning of Code section 409(h)), the Company shall issue a "Put Option"
to each Participant (or his Beneficiary) receiving a distribution of such
Company Stock from the Plan. The Put Option shall permit the Participant
(or his Beneficiary) to sell such Company Stock to the Company, at any
time during two put option periods (described below), at the then fair
market value, such fair market value to be determined at least annually
as of the respective Valuation Date by an independent appraiser selected
by the ESOP Committee. The first put option period shall be a period of
at least 60 days beginning on the date of distribution of Company Stock
to the Participant (or his Beneficiary). The second put option period shall
be a period of at least 60 days beginning after the new determination of
the fair market value of Company Stock is made by an independent appraiser
(and notification is given to the Participant or his Beneficiary) in the
next following Plan Year. The Company shall permit the Trustee, in its
discretion, to purchase the Company Stock tendered to the Company under
a Put Option. If the Company or the Trustee purchases Company Stock tendered
under a Put Option and [he Company Stock was distributed to the Participant
(or his Beneficiary) in the form of a lump sum, the payment, at the discretion
of the Company or Trustee, may be made (a) in five substantially equal
annual installments commencing not later than 30 days after the exercise
of the Put Option- ' provided, however, that the purchaser provides adequate
security and reasonable interest (as determined by the ESOP Committee)
on unpaid installments, or (b) in a lump sum. If the Company or Trustee
purchases Company Stock tendered under a Put Option and the Company Stock
was distributed as part of an installment distribution, the payment, in
the form of a lump sum, must be made not later than 30 days after the exercise
of the Put Option. The Trustee. on behalf of the Trust, may offer to purchase
any shares of Company Stock (which are not sold pursuant to a Put Option)
from any former Participant or Beneficiary at any time in the future, at
its then fair market value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Share Legend. Shares
of Company Stock held or distributed by the Trustee may include such legend
restrictions on transferability as the Company may reasonably require in
order to assure compliance with applicable federal and state securities
laws. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9, no shares of Company
Stock held or distributed by the Trustee may be subject to a put, call
or other option, or buy-sell or similar arrangement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonterminable Rights.
The provisions of this Section 9 shall continue to be applicable to Company
Stock even if the Plan ceases to be an "employee stock ownership plan"
(as defined under Code section 4975(e)(7)).

<p>Dividends</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application of Fixed Dividend.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocated Shares. Any
cash dividends paid with respect to shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock allocated to the Participants' ESOP Stock Accounts which were acquired
with the proceeds of a particular Acquisition Loan, but excluding dividends
in excess of the Fixed Dividend paid on such Preferred Stock, shall be
used by the Trustee to pay the principal balance of such Acquisition Loan.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unallocated Shares.
Any cash dividends paid with respect to shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock held in the Loan Suspense Account which were acquired with the proceeds
of a particular Acquisition Loan, but excluding dividends in excess of
the Fixed Dividend paid on such Preferred Stock, shall be used by the Trustee
to pay the principal balance of such Acquisition Loan.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any cash dividends
described in clauses (i) or (ii) in excess of the principal balance of
the Acquisition Loan which are attributable to prior fixed dividends that
are not paid due to a lack of earnings and profits shall be used to pay
interest on such Acquisition Loan if the Company made additional contributions
to the Plan to make up for such unpaid fixed dividends.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any cash dividends described
in clauses (i) or (ii) above not used to repay the Acquisition Loan in
accordance with clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be allocated pursuant
to subsection (b) below as if they were dividends in excess of the Fixed
Dividend.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application of Excess Dividend.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocated Shares. Any
cash dividends paid with respect to shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock allocated to the Participants' ESOP Stock Accounts in excess of the
Fixed Dividend paid on such Preferred Stock shall be allocated to such
Accounts, pro rata, according to the number of shares of such Preferred
Stock held in such Accounts on the dividend record date; such amounts shall
be used by the Trustee to purchase shares of Common Stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unallocated Shares.
Any cash dividends paid with respect to shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock held in the Loan Suspense Account in excess of the Fixed Dividend
paid on such Preferred Stock shall be allocated among the Employee Groups
in proportion to the allocation percentages set forth in Section 5.4(a)(i)(A).
The amount allocated to each Employee Group shall then be allocated to
the Participants from that Employee Group, pro rata, according to their
Part A Account balances on the dividend record date; such amounts shall
be used by the Trustee to purchase shares of Common Stock.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Dividends. Any other
cash dividends paid on Company Stock (excluding Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred
Stock) shall be used by the Trustee to purchase additional shares of Company
Stock as provided in Section 5.3.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Allocated Share
Rule. Any Financed Shares released from a Loan Suspense Account subaccount
by reason of dividends paid with respect to Company Stock that was acquired
with the proceeds of the Acquisition Loan applicable to that subaccount
shall be allocated in the same manner as provided in Section 5.4(a) for
Employer Contributions; provided, however, that prior to said allocation,
Financed Shares so released from such subaccount with a fair market value
(on the applicable dividend payment date) equal to the dividends allocated
to Participants' ESOP Cash Accounts and applied to repay such particular
Acquisition Loan as provided in Section 10.1 shall first be allocated among
and credited to those ESOP Stock Accounts, pro rata, according to the amount
of their dividends so applied. To the extent that the fair market value
of the shares released from a subaccount is less than the dividends described
in the foregoing proviso, Financed Shares released from other Loan Suspense
Account subaccounts shall be used to make up the insufficiency (after first
applying the foregoing proviso with respect to Financed Shares released
from such other subaccount). Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan
to the contrary, in any Plan Year the total dividends allocated to a Participant's
ESOP Cash Account used to repay Acquisition Loan(s) shall not, to the extent
required by law, exceed the fair market value of the Financed Shares released
from the Loan Suspense Account and allocated to that Participant's Account.
<center>
<p>SECTION 11
<p>Administration</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General. The Company
shall be the administrator of the Plan and shall have the rights, duties
and obligations of an "administrator" as that term is defined in ERISA
section 3(16)(A) and of a "plan administrator" as that term is defined
in Code section 414(g). Some administrative functions have been allocated
to the ESOP Committee, which shall have the rights, duties and obligations
set forth herein. The ESOP Committee shall be the "named fiduciary, " as
described in ERISA section 402, with respect to its authority under the
Plan, except to the extent provided in Section 8, for which each Participant
(or Beneficiary) shall be the named fiduciary, and except with respect
to the Initial Acquisition Loan and Additional Acquisition Loans and the
use of the proceeds thereof to purchase Preferred Stock, for which the
Trustee shall be the named fiduciary.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Membership and Authority.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General. The ESOP Committee
shall consist of six members: three members shall be appointed by ALPA,
two members shall be appointed by the IAM and one member shall be appointed
by the Company. Meetings of the ESOP Committee shall be held at the executive
offices of the Company unless a majority of all members unanimously agree
upon another location. The ESOP Committee shall have the following powers,
rights and duties:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to adopt such rules of
procedure and regulations for the proper and efficient administration of
the Plan and as are consistent with the provisions of the Plan;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to enforce the Plan
in accordance with its terms and with such applicable rules and regulations
as may be adopted by the ESOP Committee-.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to determine all questions
arising under the Plan, to resolve all ambiguities, to correct defects,
to supply omissions, including the power to determine the rights or eligibility
of Employees or Participants and their Beneficiaries and their respective
benefits; provided, however, that the ESOP Committee will not have jurisdiction
or power to add to or subtract from the Plan or any amendments thereto;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to give such directions
to the Trustee with respect to the Trust Fund as may be provided in this
Plan or in the Trust Agreement;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to maintain and keep
adequate books, records and other data as shall be necessary to administer
the Plan, except those that are maintained by the Company or by the Trustee;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to direct all payments
of benefits to Participants and Beneficiaries, consistent with the terms
of the Plan and the Trust Agreement;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to establish an investment
policy and objective for the Plan, except that it is understood that the
Plan is designed to invest exclusively in Company Stock;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to elect a Chairman
and to appoint a Secretary, who need not be a member of the ESOP Committee,
who shall keep minutes of the proceedings and have custody of all records
and documents pertaining to administration of the Plan;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be agent for the
service of legal process on behalf of the Plan;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to authorize one or more
of its members to execute any documents on behalf of the ESOP Committee,
in which event the ESOP Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of
such action. The certificate of the Secretary or any authorized member
of the ESOP Committee that the ESOP Committee has taken or authorized any
action shall be conclusive in favor of any person relying on such certificate;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (xi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to obtain an independent
appraisal of the fair market value of the Company Stock held by the Trust
from an independent appraiser who meets the requirements of Code section
170(a)(1); and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (xii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perform any other acts,
consistent with the Plan and Trust Agreement, necessary or appropriate
to the administration of the Plan and the discharge of its duties.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Provisions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the ESOP Committee
unanimously agrees that a matter affects members of only one Employee Group,
the matter shall be considered by an ESOP Committee consisting solely of
members who were appointed on behalf of such Employee Group, which appointees
must act by a majority vote, and the provisions of this Section 11.2 shall
be construed accordingly. If the ESOP Committee is unable to agree unanimously
that the matter affects only members of one such Employee Group, the jurisdictional
determination, that is, whether the matter affects only members of one
such Employee Group, shall be made by a neutral arbitrator selected in
accordance with clause (iii) below.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As set forth in Section
12.3, the ESOP Committee will have the exclusive power to hear and determine
all appeals of claims denied under Section 12.2 of the Plan pursuant to
the procedures hereinafter provided. With respect to such disputes, the
ESOP Committee will function as a System Board of Adjustment as provided
in Title 11 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, and the following provisions
will govern:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jurisdiction of the ESOP Committee
will be exclusive. Appeals may be submitted to the ESOP Committee either
by a Participant or a Beneficiary.
<p>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ESOP Committee will establish rules
of procedure for the conduct of appeals before it, which rules will not
be inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan. Insofar as possible, such
procedures will follow the procedure of the American Arbitration Association.
The Chairman will promptly advise the Company, the IAM and ALPA of such
rules of procedure.
<p>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All appeals properly referred to the ESOP
Committee for consideration will be addressed to the Chairman in the form
of a submission as prescribed by the rules of procedure. Six copies of
each submission, including all papers and exhibits in connection therewith,
will be forwarded to the Chairman, who will promptly transmit one copy
thereof to each member of the ESOP Committee. The submission in each dispute
will include the question to be decided by the ESOP Committee, the provisions
of the Plan involved in the dispute, the position of the petitioner and
all asserted facts supporting such position.
<p>(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The submission will state the names of the
parties to whom the petitioner sent copies of the submission. A copy of
the submission will be served by the petitioner upon ALPA, the IAM and
the Company.
<p>(E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The submission will state whether or not
the petitioner requests both a hearing on the facts and oral argument,
or only oral argument. The answer of each party may request a hearing on
the facts and oral argument or only oral argument. If neither the submission
nor any answer requests a hearing, the ESOP Committee may waive a hearing
and dispose of the dispute on the basis of the submission and answers.
<p>(F)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a hearing has been requested in a dispute,
the ESOP Committee will fix a date for such hearing as soon as reasonably
possible after receipt of the submission. The date for the hearing will
not be more than 60 days after receipt of the submission (unless circumstances
require a longer period which can be no more than 60 days). If two or more
members of the ESOP Committee consider the question involved in the dispute
to be of sufficient urgency, the ESOP Committee may fix an earlier date,
which will not be less than ten days after filing of the answer. If requested
by the ESOP Committee or the Participant, a transcript of each proceeding
will be made and retained in the files of the ESOP Committee. Such hearing
will be heard at the Company's Executive Offices in Elk Grove Township,
Illinois, unless the entire ESOP Committee, by a majority vote, otherwise
determines.
<p>(G)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appeals before the ESOP Committee shall
be decided by a majority vote of the members of the ESOP Committee. However,
a majority of the members of the ESOP Committee appointed on behalf of
any Employee Group has the power to require that any submission (except
for matters described in subsection (iv) below) be referred for decision
to a neutral arbitrator. Furthermore, if the ESOP Committee deadlocks in
the case of any vote, the matter shall be referred for decision to a neutral
arbitrator. In any case in which a neutral arbitrator is to be appointed,
the parties will, within 10 days after notice of the need to appoint a
neutral arbitrator, agree upon a neutral arbitrator. If the parties fail
to agree upon the selection of a mutually acceptable neutral arbitrator
the parties will select an arbitrator by alternate striking from a panel
of arbitrators supplied by the American Arbitration Association, preferably
a panel with knowledge of employee stock ownership plans. When an neutral
arbitrator is selected, the power to take further action with respect to
the dispute shall rest with the neutral arbitrator until the final decision
is made in the dispute,
<p>(H)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a neutral arbitrator is selected, any
party to a dispute may make a written request to the neutral arbitrator
for a further hearing or oral argument provided it is made within 15 days
after such selection. The neutral arbitrator will decide such requests.
If no further hearing or argument is held, the neutral arbitrator will
consider and review the prior record in the dispute. The decision of the
neutral arbitrator will be rendered within 30 days after the close of any
further hearing or argument. The neutral arbitrator shall decide the matter
based upon the record before him and the terms of the Plan and shall not
give weight to any previous votes of the ESOP Committee concerning the
matter.
<p>(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision of the ESOP Committee, or neutral
arbitrator, if any, will be final and binding upon the Company, ALPA, the
[AM, a Participant or Beneficiary and any other person claiming under the
Plan.
<p>(J)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to Section 11.12, the expenses and
reasonable compensation of the neutral arbitrator selected as provided
herein shall be borne by the Company.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as provided in
Section 11.2(b)(i), for all other purposes under the Plan, five members
of the ESOP Committee will constitute a quorum, except that to constitute
a quorum, one member appointed on behalf of each Employee Group must be
present. All actions and decisions of the ESOP Committee under this Section
11 shall be by (A) the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present
at the meeting at which the vote is being taken or (B) the unanimous written
consent of all members then in office. However, a majority of the members
of the ESOP Committee appointed on behalf of any Employee Group has the
power to require that any action or decision (except as limited in clause
(iv) below) be referred for decision to a neutral arbitrator. Furthermore,
if the ESOP Committee deadlocks in the case of any vote, the matter shall
be referred for decision to a neutral arbitrator. The procedures set forth
in subsections 11.2(b)(ii)(G) through (J) shall apply.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ESOP Committee is
the named fiduciary with respect to the management and disposition of assets
held in the Trust Fund. The power of a majority of the members of the ESOP
Committee appointed on behalf of any Employee Group to require that a matter
be referred to a neutral arbitrator shall not apply to a matter if it concerns
the exercise of authority respecting management or disposition of assets
held in the Trust Fund. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the power
of a majority of the members of the ESOP Committee appointed on behalf
of any Employee Group to require that a matter be referred to a neutral
arbitrator shall apply if (A) the matter does not involve a Control Transaction
and (B) it is reasonably determined that the resolution of such matter
might reasonably be expected to subject the Company to a material liability.
Any dispute with respect to the application of this clause (iv) shall be
resolved in accordance with the arbitration procedures described in Section
11.2(b)(ii)(G)-(J).</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delegation by ESOP Committee.
The ESOP Committee may establish procedures for allocation of fiduciary
responsibilities among its members and delegation of fiduciary responsibilities
to persons other than named fiduciaries; provided, however, that the delegation
of the power to manage or control the assets of the Trust Fund may only
be delegated to an investment manager" (as defined in ERISA section 3(38)).
In exercising its authority to control and manage the operation and administration
of the Plan, the ESOP Committee may employ agents and counsel (who may
also be employed by or represent any Employer) and to delegate to them
such powers as the ESOP Committee deems desirable. Any such delegation
or appointment shall be in writing and shall reflect the unanimous action
of the ESOP Committee members then acting. The writing contemplated by
the foregoing sentence shall fully describe the advice to be rendered or
the functions and duties to be performed by the delegate.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information To Be Furnished
to ESOP Committee. The Employers shall furnish the ESOP Committee such
data and information as may be reasonably required to administer this Plan;
provided, however, that the preceding phrase shall not in any case restrict
the ability of ESOP Committee members to see individual Account data with
respect to the Participants in the Employee Groups they represent and,
provided, further, that individualized information shall be treated in
a confidential manner. The ESOP Committee shall be entitled to rely on
any information furnished by the Employers that is needed for calculation
of benefits due under the Plan, or any matters relating to administration
of the Plan. A Participant or Beneficiary entitled to benefits under the
Plan must furnish to the ESOP Committee such evidence, data or information
as the ESOP Committee considers desirable to carry out its obligations
under the Plan. Any benefits under the Plan may be conditional upon the
prompt submission of such information.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ESOP Committee's Decision
Final. Except as otherwise provided herein, to the extent permitted by
law, any interpretation of the Plan and any decision on any matter within
the discretion of the ESOP Committee made by the ESOP Committee in good
faith is binding on all persons. Except as provided in ERISA section 405,
a dissenting member is not responsible for any action or failure to act
if within a reasonable time he registers his dissent with the other members,
the Company and the Trustee.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remuneration and Expenses.
No remuneration shall be paid to any ESOP Committee member who is an Employee
of the Company or an Affiliate for services performed hereunder. However,
subject to Section 11.12, the reasonable expenses of an ESOP Committee
member incurred in the performance of an ESOP Committee function shall
be reimbursed by the Employers. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
flight pay loss and pay loss for each IAM member shall be treated as an
expense.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indemnification of the
ESOP Committee. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the ESOP Committee
and its members and any employee, director, or officer of the Company or
its Affiliates, shall be indemnified by the Company against any and all
liabilities, settlements, judgments, losses, costs, and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) of whatever kind and nature which may
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against them by reason of the performance
or nonperformance of their duties in connection with the Plan if such action
or inaction did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Furthermore, the Company agrees to indemnify any such persons against any
liability imposed as a result of a claim asserted by any person or persons
under federal or state law where such persons act in good faith or in reliance
on a written direction or certification of the Company. The foregoing right
of indemnification shall be in addition to other rights such persons may
have by law or by reason of insurance coverage of any kind. The Company
may, at its own expense, settle any claim asserted or proceeding brought
against any such persons when such settlement appears to be in the best
interests of the Company. If the Company obtains fiduciary liability insurance
to protect the ESOP Committee or any of its members, the provisions of
this Section 11.7 shall be applicable only to the extent that such insurance
coverage is insufficient. The Company shall secure fidelity bonding for
the fiduciaries of the Plan, as required by ERISA section 412 and shall
secure insurance for ESOP Committee members coextensive with any ERISA
insurance coverage provided to any member of the Board of Directors or,
if more favorable, to any Employee.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resignation or Removal
of ESOP Committee Member. An ESOP Committee member may resign at any time
by -delivering his written resignation to the Company. Each of the Company,
ALPA and the IAM may remove its ESOP Committee members for any reason.
In addition, the Company, at its discretion, may remove any ESOP Committee
member for cause upon delivery of written notice to him. Except as provided
in the preceding sentence, such resignation or removal, as the case may
be, shall become effective only upon the appointment of a qualifying successor
member being duly appointed in accordance with Section 11.9. For purposes
hereof, "cause" shall be construed to mean an action permitting a member
of the Board of Directors to be for cause.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appointment of Successor
ESOP Committee Members. ALPA, the IAM or the Company, as the case may be,
shall, in accordance with the composition of the ESOP Committee described
in Section 11.2, promptly fill any vacancy in the membership of the ESOP
Committee and shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other ESOP
Committee members, the Company and the Trustee.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interested ESOP Committee
Member. A member may not decide or determine a,ny matter or question concerning
his own benefits under the Plan or as to how they are to be paid to him
unless either such decision could be made by him under the Plan if he were
not a member of the ESOP Committee, or such decision applies to all affected
Participants similarly. If a member is disqualified to act, and the remaining
members of the ESOP Committee cannot agree on a decision, ALPA, the IAM
or the Company, as the case may be, may appoint a temporary member to exercise
the powers of the interested member concerning the matter as to which he
is disqualified.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compliance with Laws.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or the Trust Agreement to the contrary,
every individual who is a fiduciary with respect to the Plan shall exercise
his responsibilities with respect to the Plan in a manner consistent with
ERISA and other applicable laws.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expenses of the Plan
and Trust. All reasonable expenses of administering the Plan and Trust
shall be charged to and paid by the Employers; provided, however, that,
in the case of a dispute between the Company and the Committee, the reasonableness
of any expense shall be determined without regard to Sections 11.5 and
11.2(b)(ii)(1), and, provided, further, that in the event of any disagreement
with respect to the reasonableness of an expense, neither a determination
of the ESOP Committee that an expense is reasonable nor a determination
by the Company that an expense is unreasonable shall be accorded any presumption
of correctness. Unless the Company and ESOP Committee otherwise agree,
such disagreement shall be resolved through the judicial process and the
Company shall pay the reasonable expenses of litigation (and with regard
to these expenses, the ESOP Committee's determination of reasonableness
shall be conclusive). The reasonableness of any expense with respect to
the Plan or Trust shall be determined by taking into account, inter alia,
(a) the appropriateness and magnitude of the expense, (b) comparative reference
to the types and amounts of expenses incurred by other very large employee
stock ownership plans that own a significant portion of the employer's
outstanding stock, (c) the complexity and size of this Plan and (d) the
special purposes for which this Plan was established. Payment of expenses
shall not be deemed to be Employer Contributions.
<center>
<p>SECTION 12
<p>Claims Procedure</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Written Claim. The Company,
which may delegate its authority, shall be the fiduciary for the initial
decision on claims for benefits under the Plan. A Participant (or Beneficiary)
may present a claim to the Company for any unpaid benefits. The Company
shall establish procedures for action upon claims initially made and the
communication of a decision to the claimant promptly and, in any event,
not later than 90 days after the claim is received, unless special circumstances
require an extension of time for processing the claim. If an extension
is required, notice of the extension shall be furnished the claimant prior
to the end of the initial 90-day period, which notice shall indicate the
reasons for the extension and the expected decision date. The extension
shall not exceed 90 days. The claim may be deemed by the claimant to have
been denied for purposes of further review described below in the event
a decision is not furnished to the claimant within the period described
in the three preceding sentences. If the claim for benefits is wholly or
partially denied, the Company shall notify the Participant (or Beneficiary)
in writing of such denial of benefits within 90 days after the Company
initially received the benefit claim. Such 90-day period may be extended
for an additional 90 days if the Company provides written notice of the
extension to the claimant prior to the termination of such 90-day period
and the extension is based on special circumstances.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice of Denial. A
notice of a denial of benefits shall advise the Participant (or Beneficiary)
of:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the specific reason or reasons for the
denial;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the specific provisions of the Plan on which
the denial is based;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any additional material or information necessary
for the Participant (or Beneficiary) to perfect his claim and an explanation
of why such material or information is necessary; and
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the steps which the Participant (or Beneficiary)
must take to have his claim for benefits reviewed.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review Procedure. Each
Participant (or Beneficiary) whose claim for benefits has been denied shall
have the opportunity to file a written request pursuant to Section 11.2(b)(ii)
for a full and fair review of his claim by the ESOP Committee, to review
all documents pertinent to his claim, and to submit a written statement
regarding issues relative to his claim. Such written request for review
of his claim must be filed pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section
11.2(b)(ii) by the Participant (or Beneficiary) within 60 days after receipt
of written notification of the denial of his claim.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices. All notices
denying a claim for benefits, and all decisions on requests for a review
of the denial of a claim for benefits, shall be written in a manner calculated
to be understood by the Participant (or Beneficiary) filing the claim or
requesting the review.

<p>SECTION 13
<p>Amendment and Termination</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendment.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Company expects and intends
to continue the Plan, the Company must necessarily reserve, and does hereby
reserve, the right to amend the Plan, at any time; provided, however, that,
subject to Sections 13.1(b), (c), and (d) hereof and Section 1.6(g) of
the Recapitalization Agreement (relating to skipped dividends), no amendment
may be adopted without the approval of both ALPA and the IAM.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to selected "intragroup matters,"
however, the Company may amend the Plan with respect to the Salaried and
Management Group and shall amend the Plan as reasonably requested by ALPA
and the IAM for their respective Employee Groups. An amendment relates
to an "intra-group matter" only if it relates to eligibility, or allocation
and does not relate to any other matter, including, without limitation,
withdrawal, loan, voting, vesting or fiduciary provisions; provided, however,
that no amendment may be made which shall disqualify the Plan or extend
allocations hereunder beyond the year 2000 or affect the pace of allocations
of Company Stock in a manner that would adversely affect the Plan's projected
ability to meet the requirements of Code Section 415(c)(6) (which last
requirement may be waived by ALPA). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
with respect to an intragroup matter, the Company need not and cannot (without
the required consent) adopt any amendment if it would entail an additional
annual expense in excess of approximately $25,000 or if the Company reasonably
believes the Company will be exposed to a material liability if the amendment
is adopted and, provided, further, that disputes under this subsection
(b) shall be resolved by the arbitration procedures of Section 11.2(b)(ii).
Finally, the Company may not adopt with respect to Management and Salaried
Employees and neither ALPA nor the IAM may require the Company to adopt
more than three amendments under this Section 13.1(b) and, in the case
of the ALPA Employee Group and the Management and Salaried Employee Group,
no amendment may require that allocations be based on factors other then
Compensation, Account balances, dividends, and dividend credits.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALPA and the IAM shall be accorded an adequate
opportunity to review any submission referred to in the first sentence
of Section 7(a) of the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, and they shall
have the right to participate in the consideration of any amendment required
by the second sentence of Section 7(a) of the Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement. If an amendment to the Plan or Trust is required to result in
the issuance of a determination letter described in such Section 7(a),
and if there is more than one form of amendment that would result in such
issuance, the Company, ALPA, and the IAM shall agree on the form of such
amendment; provided, that if the three persons cannot timely agree, an
arbitrator shall be immediately selected pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Section 11.2(b)(ii). Such arbitrator shall select the amendment
that would result in such issuance and that best carries out the purposes
of this Plan at a reasonable expense.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the approval of ALPA and the IAM
shall not be required with respect to an amendment if such amendment (w)
is in connection with an extension of an Acquisition Loan in accordance
with its terms, (x) extends the allocation period applicable to the Salaried
and Management Group, (y) will not cause any extension in the allocation
period applicable to the ALPA Employee Group or the IAM Employee Group,
and (z) the failure to adopt the amendment would make it impossible to
successfully complete the steps described in Section 5.4(a)(i) through
(vii) without changing the percentages set forth in Section 5.4(a)(i)(A).
The Company agrees that its authority to extend an Acquisition Loan shall
be conditioned on enactment of an amendment accomplishing the goals of
the prior sentence. ALPA and the IAM shall have the unilateral power to
require the Company to extend an Acquisition Loan and adopt an amendment
identical to that described in the preceding two sentences, so long as
the protections described in the preceding two sentences are accorded to
the Employee Groups for which the amendment is not required.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An amendment under Subsection (b) or (d)
shall not be effective unless advance notice of at least 10 days before
adoption is given to ALPA, the IAM, and the Board of Directors. Such advance
notice may be waived by the party to whom notice is otherwise due.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termination. Subject to
the approval of ALPA and the IAM, the Plan will terminate as to all of
the Employers on any date specified by the Company.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merger and Consolidation
of Plan; Transfer of Plan Assets. No merger or consolidation with, or transfer
of assets to, any other plan may be effected without the consent of ALPA
and the IAM. In the case of any merger or consolidation with, or transfer
of assets and liabilities to, any other plan, provisions shall be made
so that each Participant in the Plan on the date thereof, if the Plan was
then terminated, would receive a benefit immediately after the merger,
consolidation or transfer that is equal to or greater than the benefit
he would have been entitled to receive immediately prior to the merger,
consolidation or transfer, if the Plan had then terminated. Notwithstanding
the preceding language, in the event of a merger, if the surviving corporation
of the merger agrees to continue the Plan, no termination or partial termination
will be deemed to have occurred. This Section 13.3 does not apply to transfers
or rollovers described in Sections 7.1 and 7.5.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distribution on Termination.
If, on termination of the Plan, a Participant remains an Employee of his
Employer or any of its Affiliates, the amount of the Participant's benefits
may be retained in the Trust until after the Participant's termination
of employment with his Employer and any of its Affiliates and shall be
paid to such Participant or, in the event of the Participant's death, to
his Beneficiary, in a lump sum. The benefits payable to a Participant whose
employment with his Employer or any of its Affiliates is terminated coincident
with the termination of the Plan shall be paid to the Participant or, in
the event of the Participant's death, to his Beneficiary, in a lump sum.
All appropriate accounting provisions of the Plan will continue to apply
until the benefits of all affected persons have been distributed to them.
Affected Participants will be notified of an amendment, termination or
partial termination of the Plan, as required by law.
<center>
<p>SECTION 14
<p>Top-Heavy Provisions</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Top-Heavy Provisions.
If, as of the last day of the first Plan Year, or thereafter, if as of
the day next preceding the beginning of any Plan Year (the "Determination
Date"), the Plan is a "top-heavy plan" (determined in accordance with the
provisions of Code section 416(g)) that is, the aggregate present value
of the accrued benefits and account balances of all "Key Employees" (within
the meaning of Code section 416(i) and for this purpose using the definition
of Compensation, as modified under Section 5.5(b)) and their Beneficiaries
exceeds 60% of the aggregate present value of the accrued benefits and
account balances of all Participants and Beneficiaries, the amendments
specified in this Section 14 will automatically become effective as of
the first day of the Plan Year. For purposes of the above sentence, the
aggregate present value of the accrued benefits and account balances of
a Participant who has not performed any services for the Company or any
of its Affiliates during the five year period ending on the Determination
Date shall not be taken into account. This calculation shall be made in
accordance with Code section 416(g), taking into consideration plans which
are considered part of the Aggregation Group. The term "Aggregation Group"
shall include each plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates that includes
a Key Employee and each plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates that
allows the Plan to meet the requirements of Code section 401(a)(4) or Code
section 410 and may include any other plan of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, if the Aggregation Group would continue to meet the requirements
of Code sections 401(a)(4) and 410.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendments.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minimum Accruals. Section 3 will be modified
to provide that the aggregate amount of Employer Contributions allocated
in each Plan Year to the Accounts of each Participant who is a Non-Key
Employee (within the meaning of Code section 416(i)(1)), and who is employed
by an Employer as of the last day of the Plan Year, may not be less than
the lesser of:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three percent of his
Compensation for the Plan Year; and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a percentage of his
Compensation equal to the largest percentage obtained by dividing the sum
of the amount credited to the Accounts of any Key Employee by that key
Employee's Compensation; and
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code section 415(e). Section 5.5 will be
amended to provide that the dollar limitations in the denominators of the
"defined benefit plan fraction" and "defined contribution plan fraction"
(as such terms are defined in Code section 415(e)) will be multiplied by
1.0 instead of 1.25. However, the above sentence shall not apply if "four
percent" is substituted for "three percent" in paragraph (a) above.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
The preceding provisions will remain in effect for the period in which
the Plan is top-heavy. If, for any particular year thereafter, the Plan
is no longer top-heavy, the provisions contained in this Section 14 shall
cease to apply, except that any previously vested portion of any Account
balance shall remain nonforfeitable.</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Super Top-Heavy Provisions.
If, as of a Determination Date, the aggregate present value of the accrued
benefits and Account balances of all "Key Employees" (within the meaning
of Code section 416(i)) and their Beneficiaries exceeds 90% of the aggregate
present value of the accrued benefits and Account balances of all Participants
and Beneficiaries, paragraph (a) of Section 14.2 will automatically become
effective as of the first day of such Plan Year, except that Section 14.2(b)
will be modified to provide that the dollar limitations in the denominators
of the defined benefit plan fraction and defined contribution plan fraction
in Section 5.5 shall be multiplied by 1.0 instead of 1.25, whether or not
the minimum benefit is increased under Section 14.2(a).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Rule. The provisions
of this Section 14 shall not apply to Employees included in a unit of Employees
covered by a collective bargaining agreement to the extent provided by
Code section 416(i)(4).
<center>
<p>SECTION 15
<p>Miscellaneous</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualification. The Plan
is designed and intended to comply with the requirements of Code section
401(a) so that contributions and the income on assets in Participants'
Accounts will be exempt from Federal income tax until distributed. Accordingly,
the adoption of the Plan and the implementing Trust and contributions hereunder
are contingent upon and subject to obtaining a written determination of
the Internal Revenue Service that the Plan complies with the requirements
of Code section 401(a) and that the Trust is exempt from taxation under
Code section 501(a).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reversions to Employer.
All contributions hereunder are expressly conditioned on their deductibility
under Code section 404 and the initial qualification of the Plan. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, or in any amendment hereto,
if (a) any contribution has been made by an Employer by a mistake of fact,
or (b) the initial qualification of the Plan under Code section 401(a)
has been denied, or (c) any deduction for a contribution has been disallowed,
the Trustee shall return the entire Trust assets if clause (a) applies
or such contribution (or the value thereof if lower than the amount of
such contribution) to the Company, but in no event shall any such return
be made after the expiration of one year following (i) the payment thereof
in the case of clause (a) above, (ii) the denial of qualification in case
of clause (b) above, or (iii) the disallowance of the deduction in the
case of clause (c) above; provided, however, that prior to any such return,
Appropriate Arrangements shall be made with ALPA and the IAM to protect
the substantive rights of each Employee Group under the Plan.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governing Law. The Plan
shall be construed and administered according to the laws of the State
of Illinois to the extent that such laws are not preempted by the laws
of the United States of America.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices. Any notice,
communication or document required hereunder to be given to, or filed with,
the ESOP Committee, any union, the Company or any other person shall be
properly given or filed if it is in writing and delivered in person or
by mail (including federal express, telex and facsimile transmission) addressed,

(including any power of the Company to amend or to terminate the Plan as

a person or persons authorized by its board of directors.

<p><b>FIRST AMENDMENT</b>
<p><b>OF</b>
<p><b>UAL CORPORATION</b>
<p><b>EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN</b>
<p><b>(Effective as of July 12, 1994)</b></center>

<p>By virtue and in exercise of the amending power reserved to UAL Corporation
(the "Company") under section 13.1(a) of the UAL Corporation Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (Effective as of July 12, 1994) (the "Plan"), which amending
power thereunder is subject to the approval of the Air Line Pilots and

Machinists and Aerospace Workers (the "IAM"), the Company hereby amends
the Plan, as follows, effective July 12, 1994:
<p>1. Section 1(g), defining "ALPA Employee Group" is amended to read as
follows effective July 12, 1994:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>"(g) 'ALPA Employee Group' means (i) Eligible Employees who are in
classifications represented by ALPA under the Railway Labor Act who are
listed on the Pilots' System Seniority List or the Second Officer Eligibility
Seniority List, and (ii) notwithstanding the fact that they are not in
classifications represented by ALPA under the Railway Labor Act, Eligible
Employees in the classification of Student Flight Officer who, upon completion
of the necessary training, expect to become listed on the Pilots' System
Seniority List or Second Officer Eligibility Seniority List."</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
2. Section 1(p), defining "Compensation," is amended by inserting the following
after the first sentence thereof:
<dir>
<dir>"Except as set forth herein, a Participant's Compensation shall be
credited to the Participant for the Plan Year in which the Participant
received payment of such Compensation, even if the services to which the
Compensation relates were performed in a prior Plan Year.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i) With respect to those members of the ALPA Employee Group who are paid
in the month following the month in which their services are performed,
Compensation has the meaning set forth in the preceding two sentences,
with the following modifications: (x) with respect to the 1994 Plan Year,
"Compensation" means Compensation paid during the period beginning August
1, 1994 and ending with the payment of the second regular paycheck of January,

beginning on July 13, 1994 and ending on December 31, 1994; (y) with respect
to Plan Years 1995 through 1999, "Compensation" means Compensation paid
during the period beginning on the day after the payment of the second
regular paycheck during such Plan Year and ending with the payment of the
second regular paycheck of the next Plan Year as such Compensation relates
to services performed during the Plan Year; and (z) with respect to the
Plan Year 2000, "Compensation" means Compensation paid during the period
beginning with the day after the payment of the second regular paycheck
in such year and ending with the payment of the second regular paycheck
in May, 2000 as such Compensation relates to services performed during
the period beginning on January 1, 2000 and ending on April 12, 2000.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii) With respect to the members of the Management and Salaried Group and
with respect to those members of the ALPA Employee Group who are not paid
in the month following the month in which their services are performed,
Compensation for a particular Plan Year shall include Compensation paid
in the first and second paychecks received in the next Plan Year to the
extent such Compensation relates to services performed in the earlier Plan
Year. For purposes of the foregoing, the Company shall determine the extent
to which Compensation from the first and second paychecks received in a
Plan Year relate to services performed in a particular Plan Year according
to the Company's month-end time recording documents which are timely received
(according to Company policies and procedures), and if such month-end time
recording documents are not timely received, according to the reasonable
assumptions adopted by the Company. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences,
only Compensation from the first paycheck received in the next Plan Year
shall count as Compensation for the earlier Plan Year if the base pay taken
into account in such first paycheck solely relates to services performed
in the Plan Year in which such paycheck was received.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no payment shall
be counted as Compensation in more than one Plan Year."</dir>
</dir>
3. Section 1(gg) is amended by adding the following to the end thereof:
<dir>
<dir>"An Eligible Employee who is represented by the IAM shall be a member
of the Management and Salaried Group (i) from the Effective Date through
October 29, 1994, for each period in which such Eligible Employee's temporary
reclassification as a salaried, managerial or non-union employee is evidenced
by Form UG-100 placed in the personnel record of the Eligible Employee
by the Employer, including an actual change in the job code, but excluding
any period during which a temporary reclassification occurs on a limited
basis and is only evidenced by a payroll certification; and (ii) effective
October 30, 1994, for each hour or fraction thereof during which such Eligible
Employee is temporarily reclassified as a salaried, managerial or non-union
employee."</dir>
</dir>
4. Section 1(yy)(i) is amended to read as follows effective July 12, 1994:
<dir>
<dir>"the product of (A) the number of hours for which the Participant
earns compensation during the Plan Year (up to and including the last day
of each Plan Year), but only to the extent such hours are reflected on
the compensation paid during the Plan Year or on the first and second paychecks
received by the Participant in the Plan Year following the Plan Year in
which the compensation was earned, multiplied by (B) the difference between
the "book rate of pay" as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Date and the "actual rate of pay" as in effect on the Effective Date for
services performed during a Plan Year; plus"</dir>
</dir>
4. Section 1(yy)(iii) is amended to read as follows effective July 12,
1994:
<dir>
<dir>"the actual rate of pay (including the applicable overtime rates)
for each hour, or fraction thereof, of lunch (or other meal) multiplied
by the sum of (a) the number of days during which at least 3.5 hours are
worked during a Plan Year, plus (b) the number of overtime shifts of at
least two (2) hours worked during a Plan Year, plus (c) the number of overtime
shifts of at least eight (8) hours which immediately precede or follow
a regular full shift. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any day worked
prior to October 16. 1994, in lieu of the foregoing, the actual rate of
pay shall be multiplied by one half hour for each day worked during the
Plan Year."</dir>
</dir>
6. Section 1(yy) of the ESOP shall be amended by adding the following three
paragraphs to the end thereof:
<dir>
<dir>"If any hours of a Participant for compensation earned in a particular
Plan Year are excluded from the calculation of the Wage Investment for
that Plan Year pursuant to Section 1(yy)(i)(A) because compensation for
such hours was not reflected in pay received during the Plan Year or the
first or second paycheck of the following Plan Year, then such hours shall
be counted towards the calculation of the Participant's Wage Investment
in the Plan Year for which the Participant received payment for such hours.
For purposes of the calculation of the Wage Investment for a particular
Plan Year, the Company shall determine the extent to which compensation
was earned in a particular Plan Year according to the Company's month-end
time recording documents which are timely received (according to Company
policies and procedures), and if such month-end time recording documents
are not timely received, according to the reasonable assumptions adopted
by the Company.
<p>"In clarification of the foregoing provisions of Section 1(yy)(i)(A),
the Wage Investment for a member of the IAM Employee Group shall exclude
(i) from the Effective Date through October 29, 1994, each period in which
the temporary reclassification as a salaried, managerial or non-union employee
of a member of the IAM Employee Group is evidenced by Form UG-100 placed
in the personnel record of such member by the Employer, including an actual
change in the job code, but excluding any periods during which a temporary
reclassification occurs on a limited basis and is only evidenced by a payroll
certification, and (ii) effective October 30, 1994, each hour or fraction
thereof when such member is reclassified and is treated, for payroll and
other purposes, as a salaried, managerial or non-union employee.
<p>"Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(yy), only
hours reflecting compensation received on the first paycheck received in
the next Plan Year shall count towards calculation of the Wage Investment
for an earlier Plan Year if the base pay taken into account in such first
paycheck solely relates to services performed in the Plan Year in which
such paycheck was received. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no hours shall be counted towards calculation of a Participant's Wage Investment
in more than one Plan Year."</dir>
</dir>
7. Section 7.4(b), concerning deferred distributions, is amended by replacing
the phrase "any date" with the phrase "the last day of any month."
<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this First Amendment to be
executed on December 28, 1994.

<center><b>SECOND AMENDMENT</b>
<p><b>UAL CORPORATION</b>
<p><b>EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN</b>
<p><b>(Effective as of July 12, 1994)</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>By virtue and in exercise of the amending power reserved to UAL Corporation
(the "Company") under Section 13.1(a) of the UAL Corporation Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (effective as of July 12, 1994) (the "Plan"), which amending
power thereunder is subject to the approval of the Air Line Pilots Association
International ("ALPA") and the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers (the "IAM"), the Company hereby amends the Plan,
subject to the approval of ALPA and the IAM, as follows, effective January
1, 1995. The amendments to Section 1(p) and 1(yy) as set forth below are
intended to document the previously-existing interpretation of the Plan,
rather than to accomplish a substantive change to the Plan.
<p>1. The following is hereby inserted as a new paragraph at the end of
the material labelled "Part A" which precedes Section 1:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>"For the Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 1995, the foregoing
percentages are amended to take into account the participation by the IAM
Employee Group in allocations of Class 2 Non-Voting Preferred Stock under
Part B and the Supplemental Plan. Accordingly, the shares of Class 1 Non-Voting
Preferred Stock allocated on or after January 1, 1995, will be allocated
ratably over the remaining Wage Investment Period, to the Employee Groups
in accordance with the following revised percentages:
<p>ALPA Employee Group - 32.234549%
<p>IAM Employee Group - 47.036084%
<p>Management and Salaried Employee Group - 20.729367%"</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
2. Clause (i) of Section 1(p) is amended to read as follows:
<dir>
<dir>"(i) the total cash compensation (and any in-kind compensation which
the Participant could have elected to receive as cash) paid to the Participant
for services while a Participant and an Eligible Employee, during the Plan
Year for services rendered to his Employer, including bonuses and overtime
pay, plus"</dir>
</dir>
3. Section 1(p) is amended by adding the following to the end of the section:
<dir>
<dir>"With respect to a Participant who is a member of the ALPA Employee
Group, Compensation shall include pay received for vacation time in the
year paid (whether before or after termination of employment)."</dir>
</dir>
4. Section 1(x) is amended as follows:
<dir>
<dir>[Add appropriate amendment concerning eligibility of IAM members.]</dir>
</dir>
5. The following new Section 1(oo)A is hereby added after Section 1(oo)
and before Section 1(pp):
<dir>
<dir>"(oo)A 'Special Annual Allocation' means the allocation referred to
in Section 5.4(f)."</dir>
</dir>
6. Section 1(yy) is amended by adding the following to the end of the section:
<dir>
<dir>"A Participant's Wage Investment shall be calculated with respect
to vacation pay in the year paid (whether before or after termination of
employment)."</dir>
</dir>
7. Section 5.4(a)(i)(A) is amended by adding the following to the end of
the section:
<dir>
<dir>"For Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock released for Plan Years beginning
on or after January 1, 1995, the allocation percentage shall be as follows:
ALPA Employee Group - 32.234549%; IAM Employee Group - 47.036084% and Management
and Salaried Employee Group - 20.729367%."</dir>
</dir>
8. The following is hereby added to the end of Section 5.4(a)(iii):
<dir>
<dir>"Notwithstanding the foregoing, for each Plan Year beginning on or
after January 1, 1995, the Employer Contributions tentatively allocated
under this clause (iii) shall be the Employer Contributions remaining after
the allocation of the Special Annual Allocation (if any) for such Plan
Year pursuant to Section 5.4(f). Accordingly, a Participant's tentative
allocation under this subsection shall be the sum of the Special Annual
Allocation (if any) allocated to the Participant for the Plan Year, plus
the allocation under the preceding portions of this clause of the Employer
Contributions remaining after the Special Annual Allocation."</dir>
</dir>
9. Section 5.4(c) is amended, for Plan Years beginning on or after January
1, 1995, by eliminating the following proviso:
<dir>
<dir>"provided, however, that no allocations (other than allocations under
clauses (i) and (viii) below) shall be made to Accounts of Participants
who are members of the IAM Employee Group."</dir>
</dir>
10. The second sentence of Section 5.4(c)(ii) is amended by inserting the
following after "Such number shall equal" and before "the number of shares
that would have been allocated to the Participant...":
<dir>
<dir>"the sum of the number of shares set forth as the hypothetical allocation
to the Participant in the Special Annual Allocation for that Plan Year
(if any), plus"</dir>
</dir>
11. Section 5.4(c)(ii) is amended by adding the following to the end of
the section:
<dir>
<dir>"For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1995, the hypothetical
share number shall be calculated by taking into account the Special Annual
Allocation applicable to that Plan Year (if any). By way of illustration,
assume that for the 1995 Plan Year, a total of 1,110,456.695 shares are
to be allocated to members of the ALPA Employee Group, and that 5,000 of
those shares are to be allocated in the Special Annual Allocation applicable
members of the ALPA Employee Group. Under this example, the hypothetical
share number of a member of the ALPA Employee Group for 1995 shall equal
the sum of (x) the portion of the 5,000 shares set forth as the hypothetical
allocation to the employee pursuant to the Special Annual Allocation for
1995, plus (y) the employee's ratable portion (based upon Compensation
as modified under this clause (ii)) of the remaining 1,105,455.695 shares."</dir>
</dir>
12. The following new Section 5.4(f) is added to the Plan:
<dir>
<dir>"(f) Special Annual Allocations. For each Plan Year beginning on or
after January 1, 1995, the Special Annual Allocation described in Appendix
A applicable to the Plan Year (if any) shall be made after the application
of clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 5.4(a), but prior to the application
of clause (iii) of Section 5.4(a) and the clauses subsequent to clause
(iii), and the hypothetical allocation set forth in the Special Annual
Allocation applicable to the Plan Year shall be made as a part of the calculation
of the hypothetical share number as set forth in clause (ii) of Section
5.4(c). If Appendix A does not set forth a Special Annual Allocation applicable
to a particular Plan Year, then there shall be no Special Annual Allocation
for that Plan Year."</dir>
</dir>
13. The following Appendix A is hereby added to the Plan:
<center>
<p><b>"APPENDIX A</b>
<p><b>SPECIAL ANNUAL ALLOCATIONS</b></center>

<p>This Appendix A is part of the UAL Corporation Employee Stock Ownership
Plan. The purpose of this Appendix A is to set forth the terms of the Special
Annual Allocation referred to in Section 5.4(f) of the ESOP. This Appendix
A may only be amended pursuant to Section 13.1 of the ESOP.
<p><b>Special Annual Allocation for 1995. </b>For the Plan Year beginning
January 1, 1995, there shall be two Special Annual Allocations. The first
Special Annual Allocation is described in subsection (a) below, and is
intended to provide to the accounts of certain Participants who are members
of the IAM Employee Group the shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock
which would have been provided in 1994, but for the application of the
limits of Code Section 415. The second Special Annual Allocation is described
in subsection (b) below, shall be made to all individuals who were Participants
in 1994, and is intended to adjust the Accounts of Participants to the
levels which had originally been reported to Participants in the allocation
of shares for 1994, but which were overstated because additional Compensation
and Wage Investments were subsequently reported for 1994. The second Special
Annual Allocation is also intended to adjust the Accounts of Participants
whose accounts had not been overreported so that their allocations will
be on a par with the allocations to the Participants described in the preceding
sentence.
<p><b>(a) Special Annual Allocation for IAM Employee Group. </b>A portion
of the Employer Contributions allocated to the IAM Employee Group for 1995
shall be allocated to the Accounts of those Participants who are members
of the IAM Employee Group to whom Contributions were limited by the application
of Code Section 415 for the 1994 Plan Year. For each such Participant,
the shares which would have been allocated but for the application of the
limits of Code Section 415 are referred to as the "1994 Shortfall Shares."
For purposes of calculating the Special 1995 IAM Allocation, there shall
be calculated the "1995 IAM Average Contribution," which shall be equal
to the total Employer Contributions allocated to the IAM Employee Group
for the 1995 Plan Year, divided by the total number of shares of Class
1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock allocated to the IAM Employee Group for the
1995 Plan Year, excluding, however, the shares allocated to the IAM Employee
Group for the 1995 Plan Year on account of dividends paid on previously-allocated
shares.
<p>(1) <b>Amount to be included in tentative allocation. </b>The following
amount shall be included in the tentative allocation under Section 5.4(a)(iii)
as the Special Annual Allocation to each affected Participant: the lesser
of (i) the sum of (xx) the 1995 IAM Average Contribution times the Participant's
1994 Shortfall Shares, plus (yy) $8.8872, times the Participant's 1994
Shortfall Shares, times a fraction the numerator of which is the 1995 IAM
Average Contribution, and the denominator of which is the fair market value
of a share of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock as of the end of the 1995
Plan Year, or (ii) the allocation permitted for 1995 pursuant to Code Section
415.
<p>(2)<b> Shares to be included in hypothetical share number and hypothetical
allocation.</b> The following number of shares is to be included in the
hypothetical share number under Section 5.4(c)(ii) and Section 2.4(a) of
the Supplemental Plan as the Special Annual Allocation for each affected
Participant: the sum of (i) the 1994 Shortfall Shares, plus (ii) $8.8872
times the Participant's 1994 Shortfall Shares divided by the fair market
value of a share of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock as of the end of
the 1995 Plan Year.
<p><b>(b) 1995 Special Annual Allocation for All Employee Groups.</b> For
each individual who was a Participant in 1994 (a "1994 Participant"), there
shall be calculated a number of shares referred to as the "1995 Make-up
Shares." The 1995 Make-up Shares for each 1994 Participant shall equal
the difference between the number of shares actually allocated to the 1994
Participant for the 1994 Plan Year (using the final Compensation and Wage
Investment data), and the number of shares which would have been allocated
to the 1994 Participant for the 1994 Plan Year if the following facts had
been correct for the 1994 Plan Year: (1) the total Compensation of Participants
who were members of the ALPA Employee Group (without respect to the limitations
of Code Section 401(a)(17) and the limitation contained in Section 1(p)
of four times the dollar limit under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A)) was $415,308,677.81,
(2) the total Compensation of Participants who were members of the ALPA
Employee Group (limited by the limitation contained in Section 1(p) of
four times the dollar limitation under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A)) was $375,772,138.78,
(3) the total Compensation of ALPA Participants (without respect to the
limitation contained in Section 1(p) of four times the dollar limit under
Code Section 415(c)(1)(A), but limited by Code Section 401(a)(17)) was
$407,265,547.88, (4) the total Wage Investments were $91,675,662.89, (5)
the total Compensation of members of the Management and Salaried Employee
Group (without respect to the limitation of Code Section 401(a)(17)) was
$346,925,400.49, and (6) the total Compensation of members of the Management
and Salaried Employee Group (limited by Code Section 401(a)(17)) was $345,997,953.17.
<p>For purposes of calculating the 1995 Special Annual Allocation, there
shall be calculated (x) the "1995 ALPA Average Contribution," which shall
be equal to the total Employer Contributions allocated to the ALPA Employee
Group for the 1995 Plan Year, divided by the total number of shares of
Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock allocated to the ALPA Employee Group
for the 1995 Plan Year, excluding, however, the shares allocated to the
ALPA Employee Group for the 1995 Plan Year on account of dividends paid
on previously-allocated shares, and (y) the "1995 M&amp;S Average Contribution,"
which shall be equal to the total Employer Contributions allocated to the
Management and Salaried Employee Group for the 1995 Plan Year, divided
by the total number of shares of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock allocated
to the Management and Salaried Employee Group for the 1995 Plan Year, excluding,
however, the shares allocated to the Management and Salaried Employee Group
for the 1995 Plan Year on account of dividends paid on previously-allocated
shares. The 1995 IAM Average Contribution, calculated as set forth in subsection
(a) above shall also be used in this subsection (b). For each 1994 Participant,
the result of the above calculation which applies his Employee Group is
the "Applicable Average Contribution."
<p>(1) <b>Amount to be included in tentative allocation. </b>The following
amount shall be included in the tentative allocation under Section 5.4(a)(iii)
as the Special 1995 Allocation to each 1994 Participant: the lesser of
(i) the sum of (xx) the Applicable Average Contribution, times the Participant's
1995 Make-up Shares, plus (yy) $8.8872, times the Participant's 1995 Make-up
Shares, times a fraction the numerator of which is the Applicable Average
Contribution, and the denominator of which is the fair market value of
a share of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock as of the end of the 1995
Plan Year, or (ii) the allocation permitted for 1995 pursuant to Code Section
415.
<p>(2) <b>Shares to be included in hypothetical share number and hypothetical
allocation.</b> The following number of shares is to be included in the
hypothetical share number under Section 5.4(c)(ii) and Section 2.4(a) of
the Supplemental Plan as the Special Annual Allocation for each affected
Participant: the sum of (i) the 1995 Make-up Shares, plus (ii) $8.8872
times the Participant's 1994 Make-up Shares divided by the fair market
value of a share of Class 1 Non-Voting Preferred Stock as of the end of
the 1995 Plan Year.
<p>(c) In the case of any member of the IAM Employee Group who is subject
to both subsections (a) and (b), the total 1995 Special Annual Allocation
shall be the sum of the amounts determined for such Participant under both
subsections.
<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Second Amendment to
be executed on August 17, 1995.

portion of the Fund attributable to Part A of the Plan is intended to be
invested primarily in Qualifying Employer Securities. To the extent that

such Company Stock unless otherwise directed by the ESOP Committee. To
the extent Company contributions are made in cash and are not used to pay
principal or interest on an Acquisition Loan pursuant to Article X or to

Committee, acquire Company Stock. If at the time Company Stock is to be
purchased, the Company has outstanding more than one class of Company Stock,

Stock shall be purchased. Subject to Paragraph 3.8, the Trustee may rely
in good faith without liability upon the valuation of Company Stock as

advisable for making distributions under the Plan, may invest assets of
the Fund in short-term investments bearing a reasonable rate of interest,
including without limitation, deposits in, or short-term instruments of,
the Trustee, or in one or more short-term collective investment funds administered
by the Trustee as trustee thereof for the collective investment of assets
of employee pension or profit-sharing trusts, as long as each such collective
investment fund constitutes a qualified trust under the applicable provisions
of the Code (and while any portion of the Fund is so invested, such collective
investment funds shall constitute part of the Plan to the extent of such
investment, and the instrument creating such funds shall constitute part
of this Agreement).</font>

Securities) made under the Plan for the purpose of satisfying such Acquisition
Loan, earnings on such contributions and earnings on shares of Qualifying
Employer Securities acquired with the proceeds of such Acquisition Loan,
including, but not limited to, cash dividends received by the Trust with
respect to such shares of Qualifying Employer Securities, whether or not
allocated to the accounts of Participants (or Beneficiaries), (2) the proceeds
of a subsequent Acquisition Loan made to repay the prior Acquisition Loan,
and/or (3) unless otherwise agreed in the definitive documentation pertaining
to such Acquisition Loan, the proceeds of the sale of any collateralized
shares of Qualifying Employer Securities acquired with the proceeds of
such Acquisition Loan; provided, however, that the Trustee shall in no
event be required to apply such proceeds of sale to repay principal and
interest on an Acquisition Loan if, in the written opinion of counsel to
the Trustee, such action would constitute a Prohibited Transaction or a
breach of the Trustee's fiduciary duties under ERISA. In the event of a
default under an Acquisition Loan, the value of Trust assets transferred
to the lender shall not exceed the amount of the default, provided further
that if the lender is a "party<b> </b>in interest" within the meaning of
ERISA Section 3(14) or a "disqualified person" within the meaning of Section
4975(e)(2) of the Code, a transfer of Trust assets upon default shall be
made only if, and to the extent of, the Trust's failure to meet the Acquisition
Loan's payment schedule.</font>

<p><b>Participation and Allocations</b></center>

<p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participation. An Eligible Employee shall
become a Participant on the Valuation Date when an Account on his behalf
is first credited with Voting Shares or Convertible Shares under this Plan.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, except

is a member of the IAM Employee Group shall become a Participant hereunder
or receive any credits, allocations or benefits pursuant to this Plan.
<p>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of Voting Shares and Convertible
Shares Released Each Valuation Date.

<p>(c) As of the Valuation Date for each Plan Year, the total number of
Voting Shares released from the Phantom Suspense Account shall equal the
number of unreleased Voting Shares held in the Phantom Suspense Account
immediately before such release multiplied by the Release Fraction for
that Plan Year.
<p>(d) As of the Valuation Date for each Plan Year, the total number of
Convertible Shares released from the Phantom Suspense Account shall equal
the number of unreleased Convertible Shares held in the Phantom Suspense
Account immediately before such release multiplied by the Release Fraction
for that Plan Year.
<p>(e) As of the Valuation Date for each Plan Year, the total number of
shares of Company Stock other than Voting Shares and Convertible Shares,
(for example, shares of Common Stock received upon the conversion of Convertible
Shares) released from the Phantom Suspense Account shall equal the number
of unreleased shares of such Company Stock held in the Phantom Suspense
Account immediately before such release multiplied by the Release Fraction
for that Plan Year.
<p>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Allocation Provisions.
<p>a) As of each Valuation Date, after the allocations pursuant to Sections
2.5(c) and (d), allocations of Voting Shares and Convertible Shares and
Common Stock released from the Phantom Suspense Account shall be made in
the following order:
<dir>
<dir>(i) Section 5.4(c)(i) of the ESOP generally provides that, subject
to the Tax Limitations, one Voting Share released from the Phantom Suspense
Account shall be contributed by the Company to ESOP (Part B) and allocated
to the Participant's account thereunder for each share of ESOP Preferred
Stock allocated to that Participant under ESOP (Part A) on that Valuation
Date. To the extent that any Voting Shares cannot be allocated (due to
the Tax Limitations) to the Participant's account under ESOP (Part B) pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of ESOP (Part B), Voting Shares released from
the Phantom Suspense Account shall be contributed to the Supplemental Trust
by the Company and allocated to that Participant's Account hereunder.
<p>(ii) Second, each Participant shall receive an allocation of Voting
Shares and Convertible Shares pursuant to Section 2.4; and
<p>(iii) Third, Voting Shares, Convertible Shares and Common Stock allocated
to each Participant's Account hereunder shall be reduced pursuant to Section
2.7.</dir>
</dir>
(b) The Voting Shares allocated under this Plan (and contributed to the
Supplemental Trust) or contributed to the ESOP (Part <i>B) </i>pursuant
to the terms thereof shall be of the appropriate class for each Participant.
<p>(c) Each Convertible Share that is released from the Phantom Suspense
Account shall be either (i) in accordance with the terms of ESOP (Part
<i>B),
contributed by </i>the Company (or transferred from the Supplemental Trust)
to ESOP (Part <i>B), </i>or (ii) allocated to Participants' Accounts hereunder.
Each Voting Share released from the Phantom Suspense Account shall be either
(i) in accordance with the terms of ESOP (Part <i>B), contributed by </i>the
Company directly to ESOP (Part B) or (ii) allocated to Participants' Accounts
hereunder (in which case the Company shall contribute a Voting Share to
the Supplemental Trust).
<p>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocation of Convertible Shares and Voting
Shares to Individual Accounts. On each Valuation Date, after the allocations
of Voting Shares described in Section 2.3(a)(i) have been made, the remaining
Voting Shares and Convertible Shares released from the Phantom Suspense
Account shall be allocated, on an Employee Group-by-Employee Group basis,
as follows:
<p>(a) For each ESOP Participant, a "Hypothetical Share Number" shall be
calculated for the Valuation Date. This number shall equal the number of
shares of ESOP Preferred Stock that would have been allocated to the ESOP
Participant under ESOP (Part A) on such Valuation Date if:
<dir>
<dir>(i) all the shares of Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Recapitalization Agreement (including, with respect to Valuation Dates
occurring on or after December 31, 1995 and after the allocation in subsection
(f) below, any Additional Shares of Preferred Stock issued or to be issued)
had been (I) purchased by the Trust under a single loan on the Effective
Date and held under the Loan Suspense Account pursuant to ESOP (Part A),
and (II) in the case of such shares of Preferred Stock which are Convertible
Shares, considered ESOP Preferred Stock having the same fair market value
as the ESOP Preferred Stock that was allocated under ESOP (Part A); provided,
however, that such Convertible Shares shall not, except as provided in
clause (v) below, be considered to bear any dividends;
<p>(ii) the Convertible Shares referred to in the immediately preceding
clause (i) were released under ESOP (Part A) ratably over the 69 months
starting on the Effective Date;
<p>(iii) Section 5.4(a)(i)(A) of the ESOP were applied by allocating the
ESOP Preferred Stock (including the Convertible Shares described in clause
(i) above) among the Employee Groups as follows: ALPA Employee Group--46.23
% , IAM Employee Group--37.13 % , and Management and Salaried Employee
Group--16.64%;
<p>(iv) allocations under the ESOP (Part A) were made (A) without regard
to the Tax Limitations, (B) without regard to clauses (ii), (iv), (v),
(vi) or (vii) of 5.4(a) of the ESOP and (C) were based on Compensation
rather than the definition of compensation in the ESOP; and
<p>(v) each Convertible Share which was in fact allocated on a prior Valuation
Date to Participants' or Beneficiaries' Accounts hereunder or contributed
to ESOP (Part B) and allocated to Participants' or Beneficiaries' accounts
thereunder were, after the date of such allocation, ESOP Preferred Stock
held by ESOP (Part A) bearing the same Fixed Dividend (but not any other
dividends) as the ESOP Preferred Stock that was allocated under ESOP (Part
A). By way of illustration, assume a member of the ALPA Employee Group
has a total of 130 Convertible Shares allocated to his Accounts hereunder
and 70 Convertible Shares allocated to his accounts under ESOP (Part B).
Assume further that each share of ESOP Preferred Stock allocated under
the ESOP (Part A) has a value of $100 and pays an $8 Fixed Dividend, no
dividends are paid on the Common Stock, and that each Convertible Share
has a $75 value. For purposes of making the allocations under this clause
(v), such individual shall be treated as having received a dividend of
$1600 with respect to the 200 Convertible Shares allocated hereunder and
under Part B. For purposes of calculating the Hypothetical Share Number,
that individual shall receive an allocation of 16 Convertible Shares to
make up for such dividend, notwithstanding the fact that the value of the
Convertible Shares is $75/share.</dir>
</dir>
(b) The "Actual Share Number" for each ESOP Participant for a Valuation
Date shall equal the actual number of shares of ESOP Preferred Stock that
are allocated to such Participant under ESOP (Part A) on that Valuation
Date.
<p>(c) For each ESOP Participant, the difference, if any, between the Hypothetical
Share Number and the Actual Share Number shall be referred to as the Tentative
Allocation; provided, however, that, except for purposes of subsection
(f), the Tentative Allocation for any member of the IAM Employee Group
shall be zero. If the sum of the Tentative Allocations (ignoring negative
Tentative Allocations) for all Participants in an Employee Group exceeds
the number of Convertible Shares released from the Phantom Suspense Account
for the Valuation Date under Section 2.2 to all such Participants' Accounts
(for that Employee Group), each Tentative Allocation for Participants of
that Employee Group shall be proportionately reduced.
<p>(d) For each ESOP Participant, the number of Convertible Shares and
Voting Shares to be transferred from the Supplemental Trust or contributed
by the Company to ESOP (Part B) pursuant to the terms of ESOP (Part B)
(excluding the Voting Shares described in Section 2.3(a)(i) and Section
2.7) shall be the same and shall equal the least of the following:
<dir>
<dir>(i) the maximum number, if any, of Convertible Shares and Voting Shares
that can be allocated to the ESOP Participant on the Valuation Date under
the ESOP (Part B)<b> </b>without causing ESOP or any other Qualified Plan
to violate Code Section 415 or Code Section 401(a)(4) (if applicable);
<p>(ii) the Tentative Allocation, if any; or
<p>(iii) the excess of the Hypothetical Share Number (calculated for this
purpose only by applying Section 401(x)(17) of the Code) over the Actual
Share Number, if any. The Hypothetical Share Number described in this clause
(iii) shall be determined by recalculating the allocations made on the
current and all prior Valuation Dates by assuming the Participant's Compensation
for each Plan Year had been limited to the amounts then allowed under Code
Section 401(x)(17). Accordingly, for purposes of calculating the Hypothetical
Share Number under this clause (iii), (A) the Participants' Compensation
in the current Plan Year shall be limited to the amount provided by Code
Section 401(x)(17) and (B) the amount of dividends allocated to each ESOP
Participant's Account during the Plan Year shall be calculated by assuming
the allocation of the ESOP Preferred Stock made on earlier Valuation Dates
was also based on Compensation, as limited by the Code Section 401(x)(17)
limit then in effect.
<p>Such number shall be referred to as the "Part B Number."</dir>
</dir>
(e) The number of Convertible Shares and Voting Shares allocated to each
Participant's Account on a Valuation Date shall equal the excess, if any,
of the Tentative Allocation for that Participant over the Part B Number
for that Participant, as described in subsection (d). All such Convertible
Shares and Voting Shares shall be allocated to the Participant's Account
as of such Valuation Date.
<p>(f) Prior to the December 31, 1995 Valuation Date, the aggregate Hypothetical
Share Numbers for all Participants for the 1994 Plan Year shall be retroactively
increased by an additional number equal to X multiplied by Y; where X is
the total number of shares of Preferred Stock to be issued as Additional
Shares and Y is the Release Fraction for December 31, 1994. Such shares
shall be divided among the Employee Groups in accordance with Section 2.4(a)(iii)
and allocated to Participants based upon 1994 data (that is, 1994 Compensation
and Wage Investments, as applicable). The excess of such new Hypothetical
Share Number for the 1994 Plan Year over the Hypothetical Share Number
previously determined for 1994 shall be credited hereunder or allocated
under ESOP (Part B) in accordance with subsections (d) and (e) above, provided
that the number in (d)(i) shall be calculated and credited as if the contributions
were attributable to 1995, rather than 1994, unless the additional aggregate
Part B Number shares are contributed to the ESOP no later than September
15, 1995. The calculations required by this clause (f) shall be performed
prior to calculating the regular allocations for the 1995 year. The additional
Convertible Shares credited pursuant to this clause (f) shall, for all
purposes, including Section 2.4(a)(v), be allocated as of December 31,
1994.
<p>(g) To the extent any interpretive issues arise in calculating Tentative
Allocations, such issues shall be resolved, to the extent possible, by
effectuating the purpose of the Plan, as set forth in Section 1.1; provided,
however, that no such resolution shall increase the number of Voting Shares
or Convertible Shares that may be allocated under the Plan and the ESOP
(Part B). It is also intended that, for each Convertible Share allocated
to a Participant's Account under this Plan, a Voting Share shall also be
allocated to the Participant's Account; for each Convertible Share or share
of ESOP Preferred Stock allocated to an ESOP Participant under the ESOP
(Part A and Part B),<b> </b>a Voting Share shall be contributed to the
ESOP (Part B) and allocated to the ESOP Participant's account under ESOP
(Part B). To the extent that any shares of Company Stock are converted
into shares of Common Stock prior to the end of the Wage Investment Period,
an appropriate number of shares of Common Stock will be contributed (if
applicable) and allocated hereunder in lieu of the Company Stock that would
have been contributed and/or allocated hereunder and, if appropriate, the
number of Convertible Shares and/or ESOP Preferred Stock shares set forth
in various places in this Plan shall be revised; provided, however, except
to the extent Voting Shares are converted into shares of Common Stock,
the calculation of the number of Voting Shares to be contributed and allocated
shall continue as if no shares of Company Stock had been converted.
<p>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accounts.
<p>(a) Participants' Accounts. The Company shall establish Accounts for
each Participant to record the interest of each Participant under the Plan
and, with respect to Voting Shares (and in the circumstances described
in Sections 6.1 (e) or 6.9(b) hereof, the Convertible Shares), under the
Supplemental Trust. Subject to Section 2.7, Voting Shares allocated to
Participants' Accounts under this Plan shall be contributed to and held
in the Supplemental Trust.
<p>(b) Voting Shares and Convertible Shares. Voting Shares and Convertible
Shares shall be credited to each Participant's Share Subaccount under the
Plan in accordance with Section 2.4.
<p>(c) Cash Dividends and Other Cash Distributions.
<dir>
<dir>(i) If the Company pays a cash dividend or makes a cash distribution
with respect to its Convertible Shares or Common Stock, each Participant's
Account shall be credited with an amount equal to the dividends and distributions
that would have been payable with respect to the Convertible Shares and
Common Stock credited to his Account on the applicable record date had
such shares been outstanding.
<p>(ii) In addition, if the Company pays a cash dividend or makes a cash
distribution with respect to Convertible Shares, an amount, equal to the
dividends or distribution that would have been paid on the number of Convertible
Shares then held in the Phantom Suspense Account had such shares been previously
issued, shall be credited to Participants' Accounts, pro rata, according
to the sum of the number of the Convertible Shares allocated to each Participant's
Account hereunder and to each ESOP Participant's account under ESOP (Part
B) on the applicable record date.
<p>(iii) Amounts credited under clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be deemed
immediately invested in Common Stock. The aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock deemed acquired under the Supplemental Plan with such dividends
or distributions shall equal the aggregate deemed dividend or distribution
under clauses (i) and (ii) divided by the Fair Market Value of the Common
Stock on the applicable payment date. Such Common Stock shall be allocated
to Participants' Share Subaccounts hereunder, pro rata,<b> </b>based on
the dollar amounts credited under clauses (i) and (ii) above to the Participants'
Accounts hereunder.<b> </b>The dollar amounts credited to Participants'
Accounts under clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be debited accordingly.</dir>
</dir>
(d) Other Income Adjustments. All other income (net of expenses), gains
and losses (whether or not realized) on investments in the Supplemental
Trust (excluding Company Stock) that are not used to purchase additional
shares of Common Stock by a Valuation Date shall be allocated to Participants'
Cash Subaccounts as of such Valuation Date, pro rata, based on Account
balances. Such amounts shall be deemed reinvested in Common Stock in accordance
with the principles of Section 2.5(c)(iii) based on the Fair Market Value
of the Common Stock on the Valuation Date.
<p>(e) Statements. Each Participant shall receive a statement of the balance
in his Account at least annually.
<p>(f) Construction. References hereunder to the "issuance" of shares shall
be understood, where appropriate, as references to the crediting of such
shares on a book-entry basis even if not explicitly so stated. The book-entry
accounts to be maintained under this Plan are intended to record (on a
"deemed" basis) the economic equivalent of the benefits that Participants
would have accumulated if the relevant shares of stock had been credited
to actual accounts in a non-taxable trust for their benefit under a defined
contribution plan (but without duplication of benefits provided through
another mechanism). Accordingly, appropriate book-entries and adjustments
shall be made to equitably record the receipt or distribution of securities,
property or cash (to the extent not specifically addressed herein) that
would have occurred had the actual shares been maintained in a trusteed
account and ultimately distributed therefrom. This subsection (f) shall
not be construed as authorizing the creation of other mechanisms for the
provision of the benefits referred to in this subsection.
<p>2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vesting. Except as described in Section
2.7, each Participant shall be one hundred percent vested in the value
of his Accounts at all times.
<p>2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flowback.
<p>(a) Beginning in the Plan Year after an ESOP Participant becomes a Participant
and continuing each Plan Year thereafter, the number of Voting Shares,
Convertible Shares and Common Stock allocated to his Account shall be reduced
in accordance with this Section 2.7. On the last Valuation Date of each
such Plan Year, the Participant's Voting Shares, Convertible Shares and
Common Stock Shares (including any such shares allocated in a prior Plan
Year due to limitations under Code section 401(a)(17)) and Common Stock
Shares shall be reduced:
<dir>
<dir>(i) First, by the number, if any, of Voting Shares allocated to his
Account hereunder in excess of the number of Convertible Shares allocated
hereunder to the extent such number may be transferred from the Supplemental
Trust to ESOP (Part B) hereunder without disqualifying the ESOP or any
other Qualified Plan; provided, however, that the amount transferred may
include any such shares that were not previously contributed or transferred
to ESOP (Part B)<b> </b>because of the limitations of Code section 401(a)(17);
<p>(ii) Second, by the maximum number of Convertible Shares and Voting
Shares (such numbers to be the same) that may be contributed by the Company
(or transferred from the Supplemental Trust) to ESOP (Part B) without disqualifying
the ESOP or any other Qualified Plan; provided, however, that the amount
contributed or transferred may include any such shares that were not previously
contributed or transferred to ESOP (Part B) because of the limitations
of Code section 401(a)(17); and
<p>(iii) Third, by the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may
be transferred from the Supplemental Trust or contributed by the Company
to ESOP (Part B) without disqualifying the ESOP or any other Qualified
Plan; provided, however, that the amount transferred or contributed may
include any shares that were not previously contributed or transferred
to ESOP (Part B) because of the limitations of Code section 401(a)(17).</dir>
</dir>
The reductions described in the preceding sentence shall not include any
Voting Shares, Convertible Shares or Common Stock allocated in the current
Plan Year.
<p>(b) As soon as practicable after the end of the Plan Year (but before
the time prescribed for filing the Employer's federal income tax return
for that Plan Year), the Company shall direct the Trustee to transfer from
the Supplemental Trust or contribute to the ESOP (Part B) that number of
Voting Shares, Convertible Shares and Common Stock equal to the sum of
the applicable reductions calculated for each Participant under this Section
2.7.
<p>2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voting Shares and Convertible Shares Contributed
or Transferred to the ESOP (Part B) or Supplemental Trust.

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commencement and Form of Payment.
<p>(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, no Participant
shall receive a distribution of any Voting Shares or Convertible Shares.
Prior to any distribution, all Voting Shares and Convertible Shares held
in the Participant's Account to be distributed shall be deemed converted
into Common Stock (and cash for any fractional share).
<p>(b) Unless the Participant elects otherwise,
<dir>
<dir>(i) as soon as practicable following the Valuation Date coinciding
with or next following the later of the Participant's termination of employment
with the Employer and its Affiliates and December 31, 1995, the Company
shall pay to such Participant (or, if such Participant is not living at
the time for payment, to such Participant's Beneficiary) the value of the
Participant's vested Account; and
<p>(ii) payments of a Participant's Account shall be trade in a lump sum
in actual shares of Common Stock and cash. The number of shares of Common
Stock distributed shall equal the number of shares of Common Stock credited
to the Participant's Account (after converting the Convertible Shares and
Voting Shares allocated to the Participant's Account). In addition, the
Participant shall receive cash for any fractional share of Common Stock
(after the above conversions and based on the Fair Market Value of the
Common Stock on the last day of the month prior to the distribution) and
the value of the Participant's Cash Subaccount credited to the Participant's
Account as of the Valuation Date described in clause (i).</dir>
</dir>
(c) The Participant (but not a Beneficiary) may make, modify or revoke
one or more of the following elections (on a form provided by the ESOP
Committee):
<dir>
<dir>(i) an election that, if the Participant terminates employment prior
to the end of the Wage Investment Period, distributions shall commence
as soon as practicable after the end of the Wage Investment Period;
<p>(ii) an election to receive payments in a series of five substantially
equal annual installments (each such installment to be paid by converting
the same proportion of Convertible Shares, Voting Shares and Common Stock
then held in the Participant's Account);
<p>(iii) an election to receive the entire distribution in shares of Common
Stock (except for fractional shares), in which case the Company shall apply
an amount equal to the Cash Subaccount (net of all costs involved in such
purchase) to the purchase of Common Stock in the open market. The number
of shares of Common Stock distributed shall equal (A) the number of shares
described in Section 3.1(b)(ii) plus (B) the number of shares of Common
Stock that can be so acquired with amounts described in the preceding sentence;
and
<p>(iv) an election to receive the entire distribution in cash, in which
case the Company may sell the number of shares of Common Stock that would
have been distributed to the Participant pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(ii)
if no such election had been made. The distribution shall equal the value
of the Cash Subaccount plus the proceeds (net of selling expenses) realized
(or that would have been realized had the sale been made) from the sale
of the shares of Common Stock described in the preceding sentence.
<p>(v) Notwithstanding clauses (i)-(iv) above, any such election (or modification
or revocation thereof) shall be void unless made at least one year prior
to the Participant's termination of employment with the Employer (and its
Affiliates) or prior to January 1, 1995.</dir>
</dir>
(d) The Participant may also make, modify or revoke an election (on a form
provided by the Committee) that, in the event the Participant dies before
benefits have commenced, benefits shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary
in accordance with clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and/or (iv) of subsection (c).
Any such election (or modification or revocation thereof) may be made at
any time by the Participant. A Beneficiary may not make, modify or revoke
any such election.
<p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Loans, In-service Payments or Withdrawals.
No Participant shall be allowed to borrow from the Plan. No withdrawal
or payment of benefits shall be allowed before a Participant terminates
employment with the Company and its Affiliates.
<p>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Diversification Rights. A Participant
may not direct the Trustee as to the investment of his Account, even if
the Participant is permitted to diversify his account under the ESOP pursuant
to Section 7.1 of the ESOP.
<p>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneficiary Designation.
<p>(a) Unless a Participant designates a different Beneficiary, in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (b), his Beneficiary shall be his beneficiary
under the ESOP.
<p>(b) In order to designate a Beneficiary other than the beneficiary designated
under the ESOP, the Participant shall sign a form furnished by the Committee,
designating any legal or natural person or persons (who may be designated
contingently or successively) to whom his benefits are to be paid if he
dies before he receives all of his benefits; provided, however, that if
a married Participant designates a Beneficiary other than his spouse, his
spouse must consent in writing to such designation and acknowledge in writing
the effect of such designation, and such consent and acknowledgement must
be witnessed by a notary public. Any designation by an unmarried Participant
shall be rendered ineffective by any subsequent marriage and any consent
of a spouse shall be effective only as to that spouse. A Beneficiary designation
form will be effective only when the signed form is filed with the Committee
while the Participant is alive and will cancel all Beneficiary designation
forms signed earlier. If a deceased Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary
as provided above (or if the designated Beneficiary dies before the Participant
or before receiving complete payment of the Participant's benefits), the
Company shall pay and, if applicable, the ESOP Committee shall direct the
Trustee to pay the Participant's benefits as follows:
<dir>
<dir>(i) first, to the surviving spouse of the Participant, if any;
<p>(ii) second, to the children (including any adopted children) of the
Participant, per stirpes; and
<p>(iii) third, if the Participant leaves no surviving spouse or has no
descendants pursuant to paragraph (b) above, to the estate of the last
to die of the Participant or his designated Beneficiary.
<p>Upon the dissolution of marriage of a Participant, any designation of
the Participant's former spouse as a Beneficiary shall be treated as though
the Participant's former spouse had predeceased the Participant, unless
(i) the Participant executes another Beneficiary designation that complies
with this Section 3.4 and that clearly names such former spouse as a Beneficiary,
or (ii) a court order presented to the Committee prior to distribution
on behalf of the Participant explicitly requires the Participant to continue
to maintain the former spouse as the Beneficiary. In any case in which
the Participant's former spouse is treated under the Participant's Beneficiary
designation as having predeceased the Participant, no heirs or other beneficiaries
of the former spouse shall receive benefits from the Plan as a Beneficiary
of the Participant except as provided otherwise in the Participant's Beneficiary
designation.</dir>
</dir>
3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facility of Payment.
<p>(a) Subject to subsection (b), if, in the opinion of the Committee,
a Participant or Beneficiary is under a legal disability or is in any way
incapacitated so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, until
claim is made by a conservator or other person legally charged with the
care of his person or of his estate, the Committee may (but shall not be
required to) direct the Company to make payment to a relative or friend
of such person for his benefit. Thereafter, any benefits under the Plan
to which such Participant or Beneficiary is entitled shall be paid to such
conservator or other person legally charged with the care of his person
or his estate.
<p>(b) In the event any amount is payable under the Plan to a minor, payment
shall not be made to the minor, but instead shall be paid (i) to that person's
then living parent(s) to act as custodian, (ii) if that person's parents
are then divorced, and one parent is the sole custodial parent, to such
custodial parent, or (iii) if no parent of that person is then living,
to a custodian selected by the Committee to hold the funds for the minor
under the Uniform Transfers or Gifts to Minors Act in effect in the jurisdiction
in which the minor resides. If no parent is living and the Committee decides
not to select another custodian to hold the funds for the minor, payment
shall be made to the duly appointed and currently acting guardian of the
estate for the minor or, if no guardian of the estate for the minor is
duly appointed and currently acting within 60 days after the date the amount
becomes payable, payment shall be deposited with the court having jurisdiction
over the estate of the minor.
<p>(c) Any payment under this Section 3.5 shall discharge, to that extent,
the obligation of the Company and the Employer to pay benefits under the
Plan with respect to such Participant, Beneficiary or minor.

Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to the Plan shall be those of a debtor
pursuant only to the contractual obligations created by the Plan; no such
obligation of the Company and a Participant's Employer shall be deemed
to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance on any property of the
Company, such Participant's Employer or otherwise. To the extent that any
Participant or Beneficiary acquires a right to receive payment from the
Company or a Participant's Employer under the Plan, such right shall be
no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company
and Participant's Employer. No Employer or Affiliate shall, by virtue of
any provisions of the Plan or by any action of any person, be deemed to
be a trustee or other fiduciary of any property for any Participant or
Beneficiary.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) The creation and funding of the Supplemental
Trust shall not create a security interest in the property of such trust
in favor of Participants or Beneficiaries or otherwise cause a "funding"
of the Plan or Trust inconsistent with Section 6.1 (a) hereof.
<dir>
<dir>(ii) It is intended that Voting Shares may be deposited in and distributed
from the Supplemental Trust directly to Participants and Beneficiaries
(after conversion to Common Stock), provided that the Trustee may transfer
the Voting Shares to the Company for prompt distribution of Plan benefits
to Participants and Beneficiaries.
<p>(iii) Except as provided in (e) below, it is intended that the Convertible
Shares not be deposited in the Supplemental Trust.</dir>
</dir>
(d) The Company Stock credited under this Plan shall be used solely as
a device for the measurement and determination of the amounts to be paid
as benefits under this Plan. Each Participant's rights with respect to
such shares is limited to the right to receive a distribution of Plan benefits
as herein provided. No. Participant shall be entitled to any voting or
dividend rights or any other rights of a shareholder with respect to shares
credited under this Plan until due issuance of shares to him. Prior to
such due issuance, such shares, whether or not held by the Supplemental
Trust, shall not be treated as property owned or beneficially owned by
the Participant.
<p>(e) ALPA may at any time direct that, in addition to Voting Stock previously
delivered to the Supplemental Trust, all other Company Stock credited under
this Plan (including unreleased Company Stock credited to the Phantom Suspense
Account) be delivered by the Company to the Trustee of the Supplemental
Trust for retention and distribution in a manner corresponding to the treatment
of Voting Shares hereunder. Such delivery shall be made as soon as possible
following ALPA's request in accordance with Section 1(h) of the Supplemental
Trust; the Company shall make any amendments to the Plan or Supplemental
Trust agreement as ALFA may reasonably request to clarify further operation
of the Plan and Trust to reflect delivery of such shares (in lieu of the
book-entry system provided for herein) in the manner contemplated by Schedules
1.6(b)(iii) and 1.6(b)(iv), respectively, to the unamended Agreement and
Plan of Recapitalization dated as of March 25, 1994 among the Company,
ALPA and the IAM, but such delivery shall not await the making of those
amendments.
<p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer Restrictions Provisions.
<p>(a) This Plan and the issuance or transfer of shares of Common Stock
(and/or the payment of money) pursuant thereto are subject to all applicable
Federal and state laws, rules and regulations, to the rights, preferences,
limitations, and restrictions set forth in the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental
agency (including without limitation "no action" positions of the Securities
and Exchange Commission) which may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company,
be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no shares shall be issued by the Company,
nor cash payments made by the Company, unless and until all legal requirements
applicable to the issuance or payment have, in the opinion of counsel to
the Company, been complied with. In connection with any stock issuance
or transfer, the person acquiring the shares shall, if requested by the
Company, give assurances satisfactory to counsel to the Company in respect
to such matters as the Company may deem desirable to assure compliance
with all applicable legal requirements and the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws.
<p>(b) The Company shall at all times maintain an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and timely comply with the reporting
requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to
the shares of Common Stock. The Company shall obtain any other federal,
state or local approvals as may be necessary from time to time to enable
the Trustee to consummate any desired conversion or disposition of the
shares of Company Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be
no public sale or distribution of Common Stock without the consent of UAL
during the seven days prior to or ninety days after any registration statement
relating to an underwritten sale of securities of UAL has become effective.
<p>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inalienability of Benefits. No benefit payable
under, or interest in, the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge,
and any attempt to do so shall be void. Any such benefit or interest shall
not in any manner be liable for or subject to garnishment, attachment,
execution, or levy or liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities,
engagements, or torts of any Participant or Beneficiary. If the Committee
finds that any Participant or Beneficiary has become bankrupt or that any
attempt has been made to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign,
pledge, encumber, or charge any benefit payable under, or interest in,
the Plan, the Committee shall hold or apply such benefit or interest or
any part thereof to or for the benefit of such Participant or Beneficiary.
<p>6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Right of Employment. Nothing contained
herein nor any action taken under the provisions hereof shall be construed
as giving any Participant the right to be retained in the employ of any
Employer or its Affiliates.
<p>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Withholding. The Company or the Trustee,
- -as directed by the Company, shall withhold from any payment hereunder
any required amount of income and other taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Company,<b> </b>in its sole discretion, determines that the Participant
is subject to income or other tax withholding prior to the payment of benefits
hereunder, all such amounts shall be withheld from the compensation otherwise
payable by the Employer to the Participant. The Committee will provide
to the Company all information reasonably requested by the Company to calculate
the appropriate withholding amount. In accordance with written instructions
from the Company, the Trustee shall sell such number of shares of Common
Stock (after converting the Voting Shares, if necessary) necessary to provide
the required withholding with respect to benefits payable from the Supplemental
Trust. The Trustee will remit any amounts so withheld as instructed by
the Committee, including to the Company or the Employer if so instructed
by the Committee. The withholding of any taxes hereunder shall not affect
the determination of whether a Participant has received the benefits to
which he is entitled to under the Plan.
<p>6.6 Headings. The headings of the sections in the Plan are placed herein
for convenience of
<p>reference; in the case of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather
than such heading, shall control.
<p>6.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Construction. Except to the extent governed
by federal law, the Plan shall be construed, regulated, and administered
in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois. If any provision
shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid and unenforceable,
the remaining provisions of this Plan shall continue to be fully effective.
To the extent possible, each provision of the Plan shall be administered,
interpreted and construed to carry out the intent of the Plan as set forth
in Section 1.1 and Section 2.4(g); provided, that in no event shall the
number of Voting Shares and Convertible Shares allocated or credited under
this Plan and ESOP (Part B) exceed the maximum number set forth in Section
2.2(a) (including any Additional Shares). Any provision that cannot be
administered, interpreted and construed to carry out the intent of the
Plan set forth in Section 6.1(a) shall, to that extent, be disregarded.
<p>6.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receipt and Release. Any payment to any
Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of this Plan
shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against
the Company with respect to this Plan and the Committee tray require such
Participant or Beneficiary, as a condition precedent to such payment, to
execute a receipt and release to such effect. If any Participant or Beneficiary
is determined by the Committee to be incompetent by reason of physical
or mental disability (including minority) to give a valid receipt and release,
the Committee may cause the payment or payments becoming due to such person
to be made to another person for his benefit without responsibility on
the part of the Committee or the Company to follow the application of such
funds.
<p>6.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voting; Control Transaction.
<p>(a) The Committee shall instruct the Trustee how all shares of Company
Stock held by the Supplemental Trust shall be voted. In the case of a Control
Transaction with respect to the shares, the Committee shall instruct the
Trustee whether to exchange or tender such shares or otherwise how to respond.
In either case, the Committee shall consider the sentiments of the Participants,
but shall not be required to take any particular action in response thereto.
The Company and the Trustee agree to amend the Plan and Supplemental Trust
to provide for pass-through voting and response rights for all Employee
Groups in the manner set forth in the ESOP if directed to do so by ALPA
in writing (which notice shall also constitute approval of ALPA).
<p>(b) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or Supplemental Trust
that requires exclusive investment in Company Stock, the following additional
rules shall apply in the case of a Control Transaction: (i) if ALPA so
requests in writing, all Convertible Shares credited under this Plan (including
such shares credited to the Phantom Suspense Account) and all Voting Shares
credited to the Phantom Suspense Account shall be delivered by the Company
to the Supplemental Trust and the Plan and Supplemental Trust shall be
amended, such delivery and amendments to be in accordance with Section
6.1(e) hereof, provided that at ALPA's request, such delivery may be subject
to the same conditions for the sale of ESOP Preferred to the ESOP set forth
in Section 8.2(e) of the ESOP; (ii) to the extent possible, all proceeds
from any sale or exchange of Voting Shares and Convertible Shares shall
be reinvested in "appropriate securities," as defined in Section 8.2(d)
of the ESOP and the Plan shall continue; and (iii) if the Trustee is unable
so to invest, the Company shall make appropriate arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to ALPA, it being the present intention that those arrangements
should parallel those established for the ESOP. In the case of a Control
Transaction, if ALPA does not request that the Convertible Shares and Voting
Shares be delivered to the Supplemental Trust, the Company shall make appropriate
arrangements, reasonably satisfactory to ALPA, to protect the substantive
economic interests of the affected Employee Groups, it being the present
intention that these arrangements shall parallel those established for
the ESOP.
<p>6.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices. Any notice or document required
to be filed with the Committee under the Plan shall be provided in a manner
consistent with Section 15.4 of the ESOP, which terms are hereby incorporated
into this Plan to the extent consistent with the terms hereof.
<p>6.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence. Evidence required of anyone under
the Plan may be by certificate, affidavit, document or other information
which the person acting on it considers pertinent and reliable, and signed,
made or presented by the proper party or patties.
<p>6.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action by Employer. Any action required
or permitted to be taken by an Employer under the Plan shall be by resolution
of its board of directors or by a person or persons authorized by its board
of directors.
<p>6.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execution. To record the adoption of this
Plan, the undersigned duly authorized officers of the Company have caused
this document to be executed and to bear the corporate seal of the Company,
all as of the Effective Date.
<p>6.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooperation. At the request of ALPA, the
Company agrees that it will (a) use reasonable efforts to submit and otherwise
cooperate in obtaining an IRS ruling that the contemplated operation of
the Plan and the Supplemental Trust will not result in current income tax
taxation to any Participant or Beneficiary, and (b) adopt such amendments
to this Plan and the Supplemental Trust as may be reasonably requested
by ALPA for the purposes of further protection against such taxability,
provided such amendments do not materially increase the costs of operating
the Plan and Supplemental Trust. By accepting the Plan and any Supplemental
Trust, the Trustee shall thereby have agreed to acknowledge and accept
any such amendment.
<p>6.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjustments. This Plan contains various
references to ESOP Preferred Stock, Convertible Shares and to various numbers
of such shares. If and to the extent appropriate, an appropriate revision
shall be made to such references if the Preferred Stock and/or Convertible
Shares are changed into, or exchanged for, a different number or kind of
shares or securities of the Company through a reorganization or merger,
or through a combination, recapitalization, reclassification. stock consolidation
or otherwise.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Plan to be executed
this 12<sup>th</sup> day of July 1994.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
Trust Agreement made as of July 12, 1994 by and between UAL Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and State Street Bank and Trust
Company, a Massachusetts trust company (the "Trustee").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RECITALS:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS,
certain employees of the Company and its Affiliates are eligible to receive
certain benefits pursuant to the UAL Corporation Supplemental ESOP (the
"Plan"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and made a part
hereof; and
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS,
the Company wishes to establish five trusts, as set forth in Section 1(g),
(individually and collectively referred to as the "Trust") and to contribute
Voting Shares, to the Trust to be held therein, subject to the Company's
power to revoke the Trust to the extent provided below, in whole or in
part, at any time or from time to time, and subject to the claims of the
Company's creditors in the event of the Company's Insolvency, as hereinafter
defined, until distributed to the Participants and their beneficiaries
("Trust Beneficiaries") as benefits in such manner and at such times as
specified in the Plan;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS,
it is the intention of the parties that this Trust shall constitute an
unfunded arrangement and shall not affect the status of the Plan as constituting
both (i) an unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
for purposes of Title I of the ERISA and (ii) an excess plan under Section
3(36) of ERISA.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW,
THEREFORE, the parties do hereby agree that the Trust shall be composed,
held and disposed of as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>Section 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust Fund.</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company from time-to-time shall contribute
Voting Shares to Trust-1, Trust-2 and Trust-3 in accordance with the Plan.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and
4, the Company may not revoke the Trust.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trust is intended to be a grantor trust,
of which the Company is the grantor, within the meaning of Sections 671-677
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be construed
accordingly.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal of the Trust, and any earnings
thereon, shall be held separate and apart from other funds of Company and
shall be used exclusively for the uses and purposes of Trust Beneficiaries
and general creditors as herein set forth. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Trust Agreement to the contrary, no Trust Beneficiary shall have
any preferred claim on, or any beneficial ownership interest in, any assets
of the Trust. Any rights created under the Plan and this Trust Agreement
shall be mere unsecured contractual rights of Trust Beneficiaries against
the Company and his Employer in accordance with the Plan. Any assets held
by the Trust will be subject to the claims of Company's general creditors
in the event of Insolvency, as defined in Section 3(a) herein. No rights
to a distribution under the Plan shall be created under this Trust Agreement
independently of any Trust Beneficiary's right to a distribution or payment
under the Plan. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall have any power
to create a security interest in the assets of the Trust in favor of any
Trust Beneficiary, any person entitled to a Plan benefit by reason of the
death of any Trust Beneficiary or any creditor of the Company. Nothing
contained herein or in any provision of the Plan shall operate to create
a security interest in any part of the assets of the Trust on behalf of
any Trust Beneficiary or any person entitled to benefits upon the death
of any Trust Beneficiary.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the Plan, as directed by
the Company, the Trustee shall transfer certain Shares from the Trust to
the ESOP Trust.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Trust consists of five trusts, each of
which are set forth in this Trust Agreement. The trusts are: (i) a trust
holding the Class P Voting Shares allocated to the Accounts of Participants
under the Plan ("Trust 1 "); (ii) a trust holding the Class S Voting Shares
allocated to the Accounts of Participants under the Plan ("Trust-2"); (iii)
a trust holding the Class M Voting Shares, if any, allocated to the Accounts
of Participants under the Plan ("Trust-3"); (iv) a trust which holds the
Convertible Shares sold or contributed to such Trust, if any, as described
in Section 1(h) ("Trust-4"); and (v) a trust holding the Convertible Shares
sold or contributed to the Trust, if any, that have been allocated to the
Accounts of Participants under the Plan ("Trust-5"). For ease of reference,
all of such trusts shall be referred to as the "Trust;" such a reference
shall constitute a reference to each of the appropriate trusts. At such
times that any Participant receives an allocation of Convertible Shares
under the Plan, the Trustee shall transfer the appropriate number of Convertible
Shares from Trust-4 to Trust-5.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(g) Section 1.5 of the Plan is incorporated by reference (excluding Section
1.5(a), (b), and (f)), but with such modifications as are necessary in
light of the fact that this document creates a trust.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As provided in Sections 6.1 (e) and 6.9 of
the Plan, at the written election of ALPA, the Company shall sell or contribute
Convertible Shares to the Trustee of Trust-4 and Trust-5. Such Convertible
Shares shall become the principal of Trust-4 and Trust 5 to be held, administered
and disposed of by the Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement. In
the case of a sale of such Convertible Shares to the Trust, the Company
shall contribute to the Trust an amount of cash and/or accept the Trustee's
promissory note (to be immediately forgiven or repaid with additional cash
contributed by the Company to the Trust) sufficient to permit the Trustee
to consummate such purchase. The Company shall also cause to be delivered
to the Trust an appropriate number of shares of Common Stock to satisfy
the requirements of Sections 6.1(e) or 6.9 of the Plan.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>Section 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payments to Trust Beneficiaries.</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to Section 3 hereof, the Trustee shall
distribute the Plan benefits in accordance with the Plan as directed by
the Committee, as hereinafter set forth, if and to the extent that Shares
are available for such distribution. Alternatively, if directed by the
Company, the Trustee shall return distributable Voting Shares (of the applicable
series) to the Company for prompt distribution as Plan benefits in accordance
with the Plan. Subject to the provisions of Section 3, a Trust Beneficiary
shall be entitled to a distribution from the Trust in accordance with the
preceding sentence and the terms of the Plan, provided that the obligation
of the Participant's Employer and the Company under the Plan has not been
satisfied otherwise. The Committee will instruct the Trustee as to the
eligibility of any Trust Beneficiary for such distribution, the correct
amount of each distribution and when to make the distribution to the Trust
Beneficiary (or return such amounts to the Company for distribution as
provided above). The Committee or its designee shall keep accurate records
with respect to the benefits payable from the Trust and the Trustee may
rely upon such records without a duty of further inquiry in performing
its duties under this Trust Agreement. To the extent benefits have been
paid from the Trust hereunder, the Company shall be relieved of its obligation
to pay such benefits. To the extent benefits are returned to the Company
from the Trust, the Trust shall be relieved of its obligations to pay such
benefits.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If at any time the number of Shares held in
the Trust is not sufficient to make any directed distribution of benefits,
in accordance with the Plan, to any Trust Beneficiary<b> </b>then entitled
to a distribution, the Trustee shall distribute the balance of the Shares
(and any other assets) held in the Trust (or return them to the Company
for distribution as provided above) to or on behalf of all the Trust Beneficiaries
then entitled to distributions in the following manner: the benefits to
be distributed to any Trust Beneficiary shall be equal to the balance of
Trust assets multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount
of benefits such Trust Beneficiary is entitled to distribution of at that
time and the denominator of which is the amount of benefits all Trust Beneficiaries
are entitled to distribution of at that time (the foregoing calculations
<br>to be made on an Employee Group-by-Employee Group basis, for example,
assets held in Trust 1 shall be available for distribution only to members
of the ALPA Employee Group). No provision of this Trust Agreement shall
relieve the Company of its liabilities to pay benefits except to the extent
that the same have been paid from the Trust hereunder.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trustee shall make provision for withholding
of any federal, state or local taxes that may be required in accordance
with Section 6.5 of the Plan.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trustee shall provide the Company with
written confirmation of the fact and time of any commencement of payments
directly to a Trust Beneficiary hereunder within 30 business days after
any payments commence to a Trust Beneficiary. The Company shall notify
Trustee in the same manner of any payments an Employer commences to make
to a Trust Beneficiary pursuant to the Plan.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>Section 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trustee Responsibility Regarding
Payments to a Trust Beneficiary When the Company is Insolvent.
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trustee shall cease payment of benefits to
Trust Beneficiaries if the Company is Insolvent. The Company shall be considered
"Insolvent" for purposes of this Trust Agreement if (i) the Company is
unable to pay its debts as they become due, or (ii) the Company is subject
to a pending proceeding as a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy
Code.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At all times during the continuance of this
Trust, as provided in Section 1(d) hereof, the principal and income of
the Trust shall be subject to claims of general creditors of the Company,
but only as set forth below:
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(i)&nbsp; The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company shall have the duty to inform the Trustee in writing of the
Company's Insolvency. If a person claiming to be a creditor of the Company
alleges in writing to the Trustee that the Company has become Insolvent,
the Trustee shall determine whether the Company is Insolvent and, pending
such determination, the Trustee shall discontinue payment of benefits to
Trust Beneficiaries.</dir>
</dir>

<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(ii)&nbsp; Unless the Trustee has actual knowledge of the Company's
Insolvency, or has received notice from the Company or a person claiming
to be a creditor alleging that the Company is Insolvent, the Trustee shall
have no duty to inquire whether the Company is Insolvent. The Trustee may
in all events rely on such evidence concerning the Company's solvency as
may be furnished to the Trustee and that provides the Trustee with a reasonable
basis for making a determination concerning the Company's solvency.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>

<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(iii)&nbsp; If at any time the Trustee has determined that the Company
is Insolvent, the Trustee shall discontinue payments to Trust Beneficiaries
and shall hold the assets of the Trust for the benefit of the Company's
general creditors. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall in any way diminish
any rights of Trust Beneficiaries to pursue their rights as general creditors
of the Company with respect to benefits due under the Plan or otherwise.</dir>
</dir>

<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>(iv)&nbsp; The Trustee shall resume the payment of benefits to Trust
Beneficiaries in accordance with Section 2 of this Trust Agreement only
after the Trustee has determined that the Company is not Insolvent (or
is no longer Insolvent).</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provided that there are sufficient assets,
if the Trustee discontinues the payment of benefits from the Trust pursuant
to Section 3(b) hereof and subsequently resumes such payments, the first
payment following such discontinuance shall include the aggregate amount
of all payments due to Trust Beneficiaries under the terms of the Plan
for the period of such discontinuance, less the aggregate amount of any
payments made to Trust Beneficiaries by the Company in lieu of the payments
provided for hereunder during any such period of discontinuance.
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<dir>Section 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Term and Payments to the Company.</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unless sooner terminated by a written instrument executed by the Company
(with the approval of ALPA (and the IAM, only if the Trust Agreement is
amended to provide for an additional trust to hold Class M Voting Shares)),
this Trust shall terminate upon the earlier of (a) the satisfaction of
all of each Employer's obligations under the Plan with respect to Voting
Shares (and any other Shares held in the Trust) to the Trust Beneficiaries
(including the transfer of all such Shares to ESOP (Part B)), (b) if required
to comply with applicable law regarding the maximum length for which trusts
may be established, the twenty-first anniversary of the death of the last
to survive of the Employees who are Trust Beneficiaries as of the date
of execution of this Trust Agreement, (c) the exhaustion of all appeals
of a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that the
interests in the Trust of Trust Beneficiaries are includable for federal
income tax purposes in the gross income of such Trust Beneficiaries, without
such determination having been reversed (or the earlier expiration of the
time of appeal), (d) a determination by the Board of Directors of the Company
to terminate the Trust because applicable law requires it to be amended
in a way that could make it taxable and failure to so amend the Trust Agreement
would subject the Company to material penalties or liabilities, (e) a determination
by the Board of Directors of the Company to terminate the Trust because
the Company concludes, after consulting with legal counsel reasonably satisfactory
to ALPA, that there is a significant possibility that the Trust will not
be considered a grantor trust under the Code or an unfunded plan for purposes
of Title I of ERISA and either ALPA concurs or the Board has determined
that failure to terminate will subject the Company to material penalties
or liabilities, or (f) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company. The
Company shall provide reasonable notice to ALPA prior to any such termination.
Upon any termination of the Trust, all remaining Shares and other assets,
if any, held in the Trust shall be delivered to the Company.

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trustee shall maintain books of account
and records with respect to the Fund. The Fund shall be held by the Trustee
in trust and dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this Trust
Agreement. The Trustee shall take all action necessary to implement any
written directions received from the Committee or the Company and shall
conform to procedures established by the Committee for disbursement of
funds in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall be the duty of the Trustee (i) to
hold, invest and reinvest the Fund in accordance with the provisions of
this Trust Agreement, and (ii) to pay moneys therefrom in accordance with
the written directions of the Committee.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the extent that Company contributions are
made in Company Stock, the Trustee shall retain such Company Stock. The
Trustee shall invest any other assets of the Trust exclusively in Company
Stock (except for de minimis investments of cash pending investment in
Company Stock or pending distribution to Participants). The Trustee shall,
at the direction of Committee, acquire Company Stock either from other
shareholders or directly from the Company. If at the time Company Stock
is to be purchased, the Company has outstanding more than one class of
Company Stock, the Committee shall direct the Trustee as to which class
of Company Stock shall be purchased. The Trustee may rely in good faith
without liability upon the valuation of Company Stock as determined by
the Committee. Subject to the preceding sentences of this Section 5(c),
the Trustee may also, at the direction of the Committee, invest the Fund
in temporary investments other than Company Stock, may hold such portion
of the Fund in such investments as may be required under the Plan, may
hold such portion of the Fund uninvested as the Committee deems advisable
for making distributions under the Plan, may invest assets of the Trust
in short-term investments bearing a reasonable rate of interest, including,
without limitation, deposits in, or short-term instruments of, the Trustee.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trustee shall have no duty hereunder
to determine or inquire into whether any directions received from the Committee
in accordance with the terms of this Trust Agreement represent proper and
lawful decisions. The Trustee shall have no duty to review any investment
to be acquired, held or disposed of pursuant to such instructions from
the Committee. If the Trustee does not receive written directions with
respect to any part of the Fund subject to the Committee's direction (including,
without limitation, income, sale proceeds or contributions), the Trustee
shall, pending receipt of
<br>such directions, hold and invest such amount in short-term securities
as provided in subsection (c) hereof.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to, and not in limitation of, the
powers now, or which may later become, vested in it, the Trustee shall
have the following powers; provided, however, that the Trustee's exercise
of such powers shall be consistent with and subject to all other provisions
of this Trust Agreement, and provided further that, subject to the provisions
of Section 7(g), the powers set forth in clauses (i)-(v) shall be exercised
by the Trustee only to the extent and in the manner directed by the Committee
in accordance with the terms of this Trust Agreement, except as otherwise

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Committee directs the Trustee
to dispose of any investment or security or any part thereof under circumstances
which in the opinion of the counsel for the Trustee require registration
under the Securities Act of 1933 or qualification under state "Blue Sky"
laws, then the Company, at its own expense, shall take or cause to be taken
all such action necessary or appropriate to effect such registration and
qualification. The Trustee shall not be required to dispose of such investment
until such registration and qualification are complete and effective, and
shall not be liable for any loss or depreciation of the Fund resulting

the Trustee and its officers and directors harmless with respect to any
liability, reasonable legal counsel fees, and other costs and expenses
incurred as a result of such registration or qualification or as a result
of any information in connection therewith furnished by the Company or

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trustee shall keep accurate and detailed
accounts of all its transactions (including investments, receipts and disbursements)
under this Trust Agreement. These records shall be open to inspection and
audit during regular business hours of the Trustee by the Committee or
any person or persons designated by the Committee or the Company in a written
instrument filed with the Trustee. If mutually agreed upon in a separate
writing by the Committee and the Trustee, the Trustee shall establish and
maintain accounts for Participants which shall show their respective interests,
determined in accordance with the terms of the Plan, in the Fund; provided,
however, that to the extent that such accounts are kept by the Trustee
on the basis of information furnished or caused to be furnished to it by
the Committee, the Trustee shall have no responsibility for the accuracy
of any information so furnished. All such accounts and records shall be
preserved (in original form, or on microfilm, magnetic tape or any other
similar process) for such period as the Trustee may determine, but the
Trustee may destroy such accounts and records only after first notifying
the Comnuttee and the Company in writing at least ninety (90) days in advance
of its intention to do so and transferring to the Committee or the Company
any such accounts and records requested.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within sixty (60) days after the close
of each Plan Year, the Trustee's removal or resignation as Trustee hereunder,
or the termination of the Plan or this Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall
file with the Committee an account setting forth all its transactions (including
all investments, receipts and disbursements) under this Trust Agreement
during such year, or during the period from the close of the last preceding
Plan Year to the effective date of its removal or resignation or the termination
of the Plan or this Trust Agreement, setting forth all investments, receipts,
disbursements and other transactions effected by it, including a description
of all securities and investments purchased and sold with the cost or net
proceeds of such purchases or sales (accrued interest paid or receivable
being shown separately), and showing all cash, securities and other property
held in the Trust at the end of such year or as of the date of such removal
or resignation, as the case may be; provided, however, that in the event
shares of Company Stock are then held in the Trust and final valuation,
if necessary, with respect to such Company Stock for any such accounting
period is not received by the Trustee within thirty (30) days of the date
the Trustee is required to render an accounting under the foregoing provision,
then the Trustee shall not be required to render such account until thirty
(30) days from the date such valuation report is received by the Trustee.
The Committee and the Trustee may agree in writing that similar accounts
will be prepared by the Trustee and filed with the Committee at more frequent
intervals. No person or persons (including, without limitation, the Company
and the Committee) shall be entitled to any further or different accounting
by the Trustee, except as may be required by law.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty-four (24) months after the filing
with the Committee of the annual accounts for the 1994 and 1995 fiscal
years of the Trust and twelve (12) months after the filing of any other
account with the Committee under subsection (b), the Trustee shall be forever
released and discharged from any liability or accountability to the Company
and the Committee with respect to the transactions shown or reflected on
the account, except with respect to any acts or transactions as to which
the Committee, within the applicable period, files written objections with
the Trustee. The written approval of the Committee of any account filed
by the Trustee, or the Committee's failure to file written objections within
the applicable period, shall be a settlement of such accounts as against
the Company and the Committee, and shall forever release and discharge
the Trustee from any liability or accountability to the Company and the
Committee with respect to the transaction shown or reflected on such account.
If a statement of objection is filed by the Committee and the Committee
is satisfied that its objections should be withdrawn or if the account
is adjusted to its satisfaction, the Committee shall indicate its approval
of the account in a written statement filed with the Trustee and the Trustee
shall be forever released and discharged from all liability and accountability
to the Company and the Committee in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. If an objection is not settled by the Committee and the Trustee,
the Trustee may commence a proceeding for a judicial settlement of the
account in any court of competent jurisdiction; the only parties that need
be joined in such a proceeding are the Trustee, the Committee, the Company
and such other parties whose participation is required by law.

the Trustee shall have no duty to make an independent investigation as
to the occurrence of any event giving rise to a distribution hereunder
or under the Plan, and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the determinations
of the Company, the Board of Directors, the Company's Chief Executive Officer,
or the Committee, as the case may be, as to the occurrence of any such
event, which determinations shall be binding upon the Trustee, the Company
and the Trust Beneficiaries. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
the Trustee shall be indemnified by the Company against any and all liabilities,
settlements, judgments, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) of whatever kind and nature which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Trustee by reason of the performance
or nonperformance of its trustee function under this Trust Agreement, except
to the extent such action or inaction constituted negligence, willful misconduct
or failure to act in good faith on the part of the Trustee.

any other corporation acting as Trustee) shall be merged or with which
it shall be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
reorganization or consolidation to which it shall be a party, or any corporation
to which all or substantially all of its trust business shall be transferred,
shall be the successor of the Trustee (or of any other corporation acting
as Trustee) as Trustee under this Trust Agreement, without the execution
or filing of any instrument or the performance of any further act or the
order or judgment of any court and with the same powers, authorities and
discretions.

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trustee may resign at any time, subject
to the appointment and qualification of a successor trustee, by giving
60 days prior notice of such resignation in writing to the Company. The
Trustee may be removed by the Company (with the consent of ALPA) upon 60
days prior notice. In the event of the resignation or removal of the Trustee,

hereof until the earlier of (i) the tenth anniversary of the Effective
Time or such later date to which the duration of this Agreement shall be

"GCL"), as the same may hereafter from time to time be amended, it being
the express intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall remain

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>2.&nbsp; <u>Voting

act by written consent with respect to, each share of Class SAM Preferred
Stock held by such Class SAM Preferred Stockholder in favor of the candidate

that such vacancy shall be filled with a candidate nominated pursuant to
Section 8 of this Agreement.</font></font>

do so. The proxy hereby granted by each Class SAM Preferred Stockholder
is given in consideration of the proxy hereby granted by each other Class
SAM Preferred Stockholder and in consideration of the other mutual covenants
herein contained, and as such the proxy granted hereby by each Class SAM
Preferred Stockholder is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable

without limitation, by operation of law or otherwise. Any purported Disposition
of any share of Class SAM Preferred Stock in violation of this Section
4 shall be null and void and of no force and effect as to the proposed
transferee and, upon any such purported Disposition, such share of Class
SAM Preferred Stock shall be automatically redeemed by the Company as provided
in, and subject to, Article FOURTH, Part IX, Sections 1.2 and 9 of the
Restated Certificate (the "Automatic Redemption"). The certificates evidencing
the shares of Class SAM Preferred Stock shall bear a legend describing

so delivered, the stock certificate representing such Class SAM Preferred
Stockholder's shares of Class SAM Preferred Stock, duly endorsed for transfer,
to (a) such individual's elected or appointed successor as the Salaried/Management
Employee Director, upon such successor executing and delivering an agreement
in the form of Exhibit B hereto, or (b) in the case where no such successor
Salaried/Management Employee Director has been elected or appointed concurrently
with such individual's removal, resignation, disqualification pursuant
to Section 8(d) of this Agreement or failure to be re-nominated or otherwise
ceasing to serve as the Salaried/Management Employee Director, to the Company,
to be held in escrow to be delivered to the successor of such Terminated

from the Board, each of the Class SAM<b> </b>Preferred Stockholders (including
the Class SAM Preferred Stockholder who has failed to so immediately resign
from the Board) shall promptly vote (or act by written consent with respect
to) their shares of Class SAM Preferred Stock to immediately remove such
individual from the Board, without cause. A Terminated Director who resigns
from, is removed from or otherwise ceases to be a member of the Board and
otherwise complies with the provisions of this Section 5 shall no longer
be deemed to be a party to this Agreement.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>6.&nbsp; <u>Replacement

Company and the remaining parties hereto an agreement (in the form of Exhibit
B annexed hereto) agreeing to be bound by each of the terms of this Agreement,
and from and after the execution and delivery of such agreement, such individual

who has been elected or appointed, as the case may be, as the Salaried/Management
Employee Director fail either (i) to become a Class SAM Preferred Stockholder
or (ii) to execute and deliver an agreement in the form of Exhibit B annexed
hereto, each of the Class SAM Preferred</font></font>

Replacement Designated Nominee for a purchase price equal to the par value
thereof, and the Replacement Designated Nominee shall purchase such share
and shall execute and deliver a copy of an agreement in the form of Exhibit

The Designated Stockholder shall serve in such capacity until another candidate

transfer the share of Class SAM Preferred Stock held by him or her to the
Replacement Designated Stockholder for a purchase price equal to the par
value thereof, and the Replacement Designated Stockholder shall purchase
such share and shall execute and deliver a copy of an agreement in the
form of Exhibit B hereto<b>,</b> as provided elsewhere<b> </b>herein. Thereupon,
the Replacement Designated Stockholder shall become the "Designated Stockholder"
hereunder for all purposes. The Designated Stockholder agrees to sell and
the Company agrees to purchase (which may be by redemption) all shares
of Class SAM Preferred Stock of any Designated Stockholder who fails to
comply with the transfer requirements of this Section 8(c) by paying the
par value of each share being purchased to such Designated Stockholder
and shall (subject to the following sentence) transfer or re-issue such
purchased shares to the Replacement Designated Stockholder upon such Replacement
Designated Stockholder executing and delivering an agreement in the form
of Exhibit B annexed hereto. If such Replacement Designated Stockholder
executes and delivers an agreement in the form of Exhibit B annexed hereto
prior to such purchase by the Company, the Company shall issue to such
successor one share of Class SAM Preferred Stock upon the payment of the
par value thereof.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>(d)&nbsp; Any person

<P>paragraph 1-H-3 and 1-H-4 if it fully complies with each</P>
<P>element of the following review and approval process:</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-a-(1) </B>The Company rationally projects, in an</P>

<P>and one-third percent (33 1/3%) in its reported</P>
<P>pre-tax earnings (excluding extraordinary debits and</P>
<P>credits in accordance with GAAP) over the next twelve</P>
<P>(12) months if it does not initiate a Reduction (such</P>

<P>Reduction include without limitation:</P>

<P>judgment justifies the substantial year-over-year</P>

<B><P>1-H-5-a-(2) </B>The Company presents its Downturn</P>
<P>Projection and supporting information and</P>

<P>Parent (the "Board") determines, at least 30 days</P>
<P>before a Reduction and through a formal resolution</P>
<P>following full review and debate that the Company must</P>
<P>initiate a Reduction in order to avoid the substantial</P>
<P>decrease in profitability described above.</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-a-(4) </B>The Company and the Association jointly</P>
<P>select and brief a recognized expert of national</P>
<P>standing (the "Neutral Professional") in connection with</P>
<P>the following review process:</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-a-(4)-(a) </B>If the Association disputes that the</P>
<P>Downturn Projection is based upon a rational</P>
<P>business judgment, the Association shall so inform</P>
<P>the Company within two business days of the</P>
<P>Board's determination. In that event, the Company</P>
<P>and the Association will immediately submit their</P>
<P>dispute to the Neutral Professional.</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-a-(4)-(b) </B>The Neutral Professional will</P>
<P>determine within three days of submission whether</P>
<P>the Company failed to base the Downturn Projection</P>
<P>on a rational business judgment and shall inform</P>
<P>both the Company and the Association of the basis</P>
<P>for any determination that the Company failed to</P>
<P>base the Downtown Projection on an rational</P>
<P>business judgment (a "Downturn Rejection</P>
<P>Decision").</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-a-(4)-(c) </B>If the Neutral Professional makes a</P>
<P>Downturn Rejection Decision, the Company may not</P>
<P>initiate a Reduction until the Board reconsiders and</P>
<P>takes a new vote on whether, in light of the Neutral</P>
<P>Professional's report, the Company must initiate a</P>
<P>Reduction in order to avoid the substantial decrease</P>
<P>in profitability described above.</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-a-(5) </B>- While a Reduction remains in effect:</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-a-(5)-(a) </B>The Company will provide the</P>
<P>Association any financial and operational</P>
<P>information that the Association reasonably</P>
<P>requests to monitor the Company's performance</P>
<P>and projections;</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-a-(5)-(b) </B>The Company will meet with the</P>

<P>Company's operational results, financial</P>
<P>performance, business plans and future projections</P>
<P>in order to discuss whether the Company would</P>
<P>continue to experience the substantial decrease in</P>
<P>profitability described above in the absence of the</P>
<P>Reduction; and</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-a-(5)-(c) </B>The Board will review and re-evaluate</P>
<P>the reduction resolution at least every six</P>

<B><P>1-H-5-b- Reduction Limits</P>
</B><P>If the Company fully complies with the review and</P>
<P>approval process described in paragraph 1-H-5-a above, it</P>
<P>may initiate a Reduction in accordance with the following:</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-b-(1) </B>The Company may initiate the Reduction to</P>
<P>the extent necessary to eliminate flight operations that,</P>
<P>according to the Company's reasonable projections,</P>
<P>produce negative cash flow for the Company over the</P>
<P>projected period of reduced flight operations. As a</P>
<P>general rule, the Company will project cash flow based</P>
<P>on the difference between (i) the net forgone revenues</P>
<P>for the applicable flight operations (including segment</P>
<P>and beyond revenues and after adjusting for revenue</P>
<P>recapture on other Company operations, the resale of</P>
<P>beyond seats, competitive capacity adjustments and</P>
<P>pricing adjustments) and (ii) the actual system-wide</P>
<P>(both segment and beyond) flight operating expenses,</P>
<P>traffic related expenses, aircraft ownership costs</P>
<P>(excluding depreciation), infrastructure and overhead</P>
<P>costs, and cost of capital that are reasonably allocated</P>
<P>to the applicable flight operations.</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-b-(2) </B>It is the intent of the Company that a</P>
<P>Reduction will be temporary in nature. At the</P>
<P>conclusion of the Reduction, the Company will resume</P>
<P>the levels set forth in paragraph 1-H-3 and 1-H-4 above</P>
<P>as soon as circumstances warrant; and</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-b-(3) </B>During a Reduction, the Company will not</P>
<P>permit Feeder Carriers to:</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-b-(3)-(a) </B>Operate more Small Jets in Feeder</P>
<P>Carrier Operations than were operated in the period</P>
<P>sixty to ninety (60-90) days before the Reduction</P>
<P>except for replacement aircraft permitted by</P>
<P>paragraph 1-C-1-f-(3) above and a maximum of six</P>
<P>(6) Small Jets that (i) are subject to firm and binding</P>

<P>Round Trips in any Market operated by the</P>
<P>Company at any time during the twenty-four (24)</P>
<P>months preceding the Reduction unless the</P>
<P>Company demonstrates that increased Round Trips</P>
<P>initiated in the Market instead of the Small Jet</P>
<P>Round Trip would not pass the BIRR Test; or</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-b-(3)-(c) </B>Increase the number of Small Jet</P>
<P>frequencies, Small Jet block hours or Small Jet</P>
<P>ASMs on any Route operated by the Company at</P>
<P>any time in the twenty-four (24) months preceding</P>
<P>the Reduction, unless the Feeder Carrier provided</P>
<P>Feeder Carrier Small Jet service on the Route for at</P>
<P>least six (6) months immediately prior to the</P>
<P>Reduction and the Company did not serve the Route</P>
<P>during that six-month period.</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-c- Pilot Protection during a Reduction</P>
</B><P>Any pilot who is surplussed pursuant to Section 8-K of the</P>

<P>seniority to hold an assignment in the same or a higher-paying</P>

<P>prior to the surplus notice, and who bumps into a lower-paying</P>
<P>pilot assignment pursuant to Section 8-K of the</P>
<P>Agreement, will continue to be paid at the hourly pay rate</P>
<P>applicable to his pre-surplus assignment for all work</P>
<P>performed each month in his post-surplus assignment</P>
<P>until the earlier of:</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-c-(1) </B>The date he is activated in an assignment</P>
<P>with an equal or greater hourly pay rate than his pre-surplus</P>
<P>assignment;</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-c-(2) </B>The date he passes up an opportunity to</P>
<P>bid for an available vacancy that his seniority would</P>
<P>permit him to be awarded with an hourly pay rate equal</P>
<P>to or greater than his pre-surplus assignment (in which</P>
<P>case pay protection will be discontinued on the first of</P>
<P>the month following the publication of the award which</P>
<P>caused him to lose his pay protection);</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-c-(3) </B>The first of the month following the date he</P>
<P>retires, provided a pilot who reaches age sixty (60) and</P>
<P>bumps to a Second Officer Position will be pay</P>
<P>protected at the Second Officer rate; or</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1-H-5-c-(4) </B>Eighteen (18) months following the date he</P>
<P>is activated into a lower-paying pilot position in</P>
<P>connection with Section 8-K of the Agreement.</P>
<P>A Pay Protection Period means and includes any</P>
<P>period between (i) the first day of a month in which the</P>
<P>Company has failed to reach the minimum block hour</P>
<P>guarantee described in paragraph 1-H-4 and (ii) the</P>
<P>last day of the next occurring month by which the</P>
<P>Company has met the minimum block hour guarantee</P>
<P>described in paragraph 1-H-4 each month for the</P>
<P>preceding twelve (12) consecutive months.</P>
<B><P>1-H-5-d- Circumstances beyond the Company's</P>
<P>Control</P>
</B><P>In addition to the Company's ability to reduce flight</P>
<P>operations under the terms and conditions described in</P>
<P>paragraph 1-H-5-a (Substantial Economic Downturn) and</P>
<P>1-H-5-b (Reduction Limits) above, the commitments and</P>
<P>protections described in paragraph 1-H-1 (Furlough</P>
<P>Protection), 1-H-2 (Active Status Protection), 1-H-3 (Fleet</P>
<P>Size Guarantee), 1-H-4 (Block Hours Guarantee) and 1-H-5-</P>
<P>c (Pay Protection) above may be modified if and only to</P>
<P>the extent that the Company demonstrates that any such</P>
<P>modification is a direct result of a circumstance beyond</P>
<P>the Company's control. The phrase "circumstance beyond</P>
<P>the Company's control" means only a natural disaster, a</P>
<P>labor dispute within the Company involving a cessation of</P>
<P>work, the grounding of a substantial number of Company</P>
<P>Aircraft by a government agency, a reduction in flight</P>
<P>operations directly caused by a supplier's inability to</P>
<P>provide sufficient aircraft, fuel or other critical materials</P>
<P>for the Company's operations, revocation of the</P>
<P>Company's operating certificate(s), a declared or</P>
<P>undeclared war emergency that causes the Company to</P>
<P>cease conducting a substantial portion of its flight</P>
<P>operations, compulsion by a domestic or foreign</P>
<P>government agency, or court or legislative action. For</P>
<P>purposes of clarification, the phrase "circumstance</P>
<P>beyond the Company's control" does not include any</P>
<P>economic or financial considerations including, but not</P>
<P>limited to, the price of fuel, aircraft or other supplies, the</P>
<P>cost of labor, the level of revenues, the state of the</P>
<P>economy, the financial state of the Company, or the</P>
<P>relative profitability or unprofitability of the Company's</P>
<P>then-current operations in the absence of the</P>
<P>circumstances described in the preceding sentence.</P>

<P>at the new residence location, if less, plus garage storage</P>

<P>residence in Alaska. Notwithstanding the provisions of.</P>
<B><P>Page 146 Section 10-C-2</P>
</B><P>Section 10-C-3 of the Agreement, this move entitlement</P>
<P>shall apply only to a move from Alaska to the mainland.</P>
<B><P>10-C-2- </B>Should a pilot receive a second paid move</P>
<P>entitlement prior to his using an earlier entitlement, he shall</P>
<P>be entitled only to one (1) Company paid move; however, the</P>
<P>paid mileage available for the transportation of automobile(s)</P>
<P>and household goods will be added during the period wherein</P>

<I><P>Offset paid move </P>
</I><B><P>10-C-3- </B>In the application of this paid move provision, the</P>
<P>locations of the old and new residences shall not affect the</P>
<P>entitlement, except that the pilot shall bear the added</P>
<P>expense incurred should the actual distance moved exceed</P>
<P>the mileage to which he is entitled. In determining the amount</P>
<P>to be paid by the pilot, the line haul allowance for moving</P>
<P>household goods will be computed by multiplying the "line</P>
<P>haul weight rate" for the move initially acquired by the weight</P>
<P>of the move actually accomplished.</P>
<I><P>Pilot forfeits</P>

</I><B><P>10-C-4- </B>Notwithstanding the provisions of 10-C-2 and 10-C-3</P>
<P>above, should a pilot receive another assignment which is</P>
<P>located at the domicile from which his first entitlement</P>
<P>originated, prior to using the entitlement associated with that</P>
<P>first reassignment, he shall receive no new paid move</P>
<P>entitlement and shall also forfeit the first entitlement.</P>
<P>Example: A pilot who has an unused entitlement between</P>
<P>ORD and DEN as a result of a bid to DEN which was</P>
<P>activated within the paid move entitlement period would lose</P>
<P>that entitlement and would receive no new entitlement if he</P>
<P>bid back to ORD and was activated before the expiration of</P>
<P>the paid move entitlement period associated with the original</P>
<P>ORD-DEN entitlement.</P>
<B><P>10-C-5- </B>In the event a pilot incurs and is reimbursed for</P>

<P>of flying, including secondary lines, and/or reserve lines he</P>
<P>desires. He may also indicate his desire to be awarded a</P>
<P>floater reserve line. A line of flying or reserve line which is</P>
<P>open for a full schedule month due to the planned absence of</P>
<P>the initially assigned pilot, will be assigned to the next</P>
<P>eligible pilot(s) so preferencing who is available for the full</P>
<P>month, as part of the line awarding process. If a pilot</P>
<P>preferences secondary lines, he may also indicate which of</P>
<P>the schedule characteristics he considers most desirable. A</P>
<P>pilot will not be awarded a secondary line if he is not planned</P>
<P>to be available for the full month. "Available for the full</P>

</I><B><P>21-K-1- </B>The parties agree that the Company will maintain</P>
<P>the new cockpit jumpseat policy established June 15, 1989</P>
<P>which provides that the United cockpit jumpseat may be</P>
<P>granted to other Part 121 air carrier pilots where a reciprocal</P>

<B><P>Page 236 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21-L-1-a</P>

<B><P>21-L-1-c- </B>Each pilot may elect four times a year, during a</P>

<P>his UG-100 address. Once having selected the mailing</P>
<P>option, the service will continue until the pilot requests</P>
<P>that it be terminated. If a pilot fails to select paycheck</P>
<P>mailing, his check will be sent to his domicile office for</P>
<P>pick-up. A pilot may discontinue this check-mailing service</P>
<P>at any time by having his Manager notify EXOPZ.</P>
<B><P>21-L-1-d- </B>The Company shall charge a fee of $6.00 per</P>
<P>year to cover the cost of this service. The service year</P>
<P>shall run from April 1 to March 31.</P>
<B><P>21-L-2- </B>In the event the Company incurs additional</P>
<P>administrative costs due to increased requests for stop</P>
<P>payments, incorrect addresses, etc., the Company may</P>
<P>terminate this procedure, after discussion with the</P>
<P>Association.</P>

<P>In accordance with the provisions of the Letter of Agreement, dated June 27, </P>
<P>1979, which appears on pages 157-158 of the 1981 Pilot Agreement, and as </P>
<P>directed by order of the United States District Court, dated May 31, 1983, the </P>
<P>parties have met and have agreed upon the following modifications to the </P>
<P>Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement replaced the Letter of Agreement, dated January </P>
<P>19, 1983.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-1- </B>Second Officers shall be permitted to work beyond age 60.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-2- </B>Any Captain or First Officer or International Relief Pilot shall be eligible </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he intends to assume upon reaching age 60. This bump must be made not </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less than ninety (90) days prior to his 60th birthday.</P>

<P>year liquidated under the provisions of Section 11 of the Agreement to the extent </P>
<P>possible in that vacation year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such pilot shall be eligible for the application of </P>
<P>this provision of Section 11-E-3 of the Agreement even if it increases the amount </P>
<P>of unliquidated vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any vacation not liquidated shall be paid to him at his </P>
<P>current rates at the end of that vacation year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a pilot reaches age 60, he </P>
<P>shall no longer be entitled to defer liquidation of accrued vacation.</P>
<B><P>A-6- </B>Any flight officer utilizing the provisions of this Letter of Agreement shall be</P>
<P>paid at the rate of pay associated with the assignment held at age 60 until the </P>
<P>first of the scheduled month following his 60th birthday, or upon activation of a </P>

<P>surplusage under the provisions of Section 8 of the Agreement who cannot </P>
<P>qualify for another assignment under the provisions of Section 8-K-2-a shall be</P>
<P>furloughed, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7 of the Agreement.</P>

</I><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">UNITED AIRLINES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER">LETTER OF AGREEMENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Dear Fellow Pilots:</P>
<P>In the interest of providing the highest standards of professionalism and safety </P>
<P>among the pilots of United Airlines...and to insure that all pilots are treated fairly, </P>
<P>consistently and effectively...the Company and the Association have agreed to </P>
<P>the following procedure for the resolution of cockpit conflicts.&nbsp;&nbsp;United Airlines </P>
<P>traditional authority and responsibilities regarding proficiency and air safety shall not in any way be altered by the terms of this letter.</P>
<B><P>1. </B>When a professional standards problem arises, whatever the source, which</P>
<P>precipitates a cockpit conflict, and is brought to the attention of the Association </P>
<P>by a pilot, the Association will act as follows:</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-a- </B>The individuals involved will be encouraged to discuss the matter</P>
<P>privately in a forthright and reasoned manner, in an attempt to settle their </P>
<P>dispute.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-b- </B>Failing this, the local Professional Standards Committee members will </P>
<P>elicit both sides of the story, generally by telephone, and counsel both parties at </P>
<P>a peer level; (e.g.) a Captain committee member will call a Captain involved, a </P>
<P>First Officer committee member will call a First Officer involved, and a Second </P>
<P>Officer member will call a Second Officer involved. Again, agreement to resolve </P>
<P>the dispute will be sought.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-c- </B>Should this fail, the pilots involved will be invited to a Local Professional</P>
<P>Standards Committee meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;After each pilot has had the opportunity to </P>
<P>present his or her view of the matter, the committee will seek a commitment from </P>
<P>the parties to end the conflict and work together in the future constructively and</P>
<P>without dissension.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-d- </B>Should one of the pilots refuse to participate the Association will advise </P>
<P>the Company of the conflict and request the Company to encourage all involved </P>
<P>parties to attend the Professional Standards Committee meeting.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>When a Professional Standards problem (as defined above) is brought to the</P>
<P>attention of the Company in the first instance, at management's discretion, the</P>
<P>Company will refer that issue and the parties involved to the Local Professional</P>
<P>Standards Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each pilot will be encouraged to attend the committee's</P>
<P>meeting to settle their dispute in a reasoned, no-fault manner.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Page 71</P>
</B><P>Successful resolution of a problem will produce a committee report to the </P>
<P>Company that states the matter is resolved. Lack of successful resolution will </P>
<P>produce a report to the Company that the Local Professional Standards </P>
<P>Committee is unable to be of assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Complete confidentiality</U> regarding the </P>
<P>committee's meeting will be maintained and further, the Company agrees not to </P>
<P>cite a pilot's involvement with the Professional Standards Committee in any </P>
<P>subsequent disciplinary proceeding.</P>
<P>Should successful resolution of a problem not be attained within 30-day time </P>
<P>period, the Company will then be free to take whatever action it deems </P>
<P>necessary to resolve the issue within the framework of the agreement.</P>
<P>Either party to this agreement reserves the right to cancel it upon giving a 30 </P>
<P>Days written notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepted and agreed to this 3rd day of August, 1987.</P>

<P>Dear Captain Dubinsky:</P>
<P>Recent discussion between the parties have resulted in the following </P>
<P>understanding:</P>
<P>United will install a Unimatic terminal with an associated printer in the MEC </P>
<P>office for the use of MEC representatives and staff. This terminal will be </P>
<P>authorized Mode 41 access and will be used in the same manner and for the </P>
<P>same purpose as the "public" pilot sets located at each domicile.</P>
<P>This terminal is being provided to the UAL-MEC by the Company in </P>
<P>recognition of the mutual benefits which it can provide; however it may be </P>
<P>removed if the Company concludes that the presence of an Unimatic terminal in </P>
<P>the MEC office may compromise United's computer and/or Corporate security or </P>
<P>for any other reason may no longer be mutually beneficial.</P>
<P>The direct cost of operating this terminal will be borne by the Association, </P>
<P>however the Company will retain ownership and perform all required </P>
<P>maintenance of the equipment.</P>
<P>It is understood that this agreement shall establish no precedent and will not </P>
<P>be cited in the future for any purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this accurately reflects our </P>
<P>understanding, please sign and return two (2) copies of this letter for our files.</P>

<P>Dear Captain Dubinsky:</P>
<P>As the result of discussions between the parties, it has been agreed that:</P>
<P>When a pilot is required to provide a urine or breath specimen at the conclusion </P>
<P>of his assigned trip sequence in order to comply with the Federally mandated </P>
<P>random drug testing program, his duty period just completed shall be extended </P>
<P>by 15 minutes beyond the duty time provided by the application of Section 5-G of </P>
<P>the Agreement or of Section 3-N of the International Supplement, whichever is </P>
<P>applicable.</P>
<P>Such duty time credit shall be included in the computation of each pilot's pay </P>
<P>credit for that trip sequence; however, this 15 minutes credit shall not preclude a </P>
<P>pilot from being tested.</P>
<P>It is understood that the 15 minutes of duty time credit provided above shall </P>
<P>Constitute full compensation for participation in the drug testing program </P>
<P>regardless of variations in the actual amount of time spent by each pilot in </P>
<P>accomplishing this procedure.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>3-E-1-b above.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E-2-b- </B>A reserve's position on the FIFO list under this option will be</P>
<P>determined by the time the reserve blocked in from his last assignment, i.e., </P>
<P>a reserve who blocked in at 1700 will go ahead of a reserve who blocked in </P>
<P>at 1800 regardless of when the individual pilots volunteer to go to the top of </P>
<P>the FIFO list. This block in time rule (block in time of last flight assignment) </P>
<P>also applies to a reserve coming off days off.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-2-c- </B>A reserve who volunteers to go to the top of the FIFO list under this</P>
<P>provision and who subsequently does not receive an assignment by 2359 of </P>

<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-6- </B>All non-augmented international flying operated under domestic contract</P>
<P>rules of the Agreement, will, for the purposes of the required rest rule, be </P>
<P>treated as domestic flying.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-7- </B>Reserve Days Off</P>
<P>At equipment domiciles where scheduled international flying is assigned, all</P>
<P>international reserve lines available for monthly preferencing shall include </P>
<P>one period of six (6) consecutive days off in a 30 day month and seven (7) </P>
<P>consecutive days off in a 31 day month which may not be disrupted without </P>
<P>pilot concurrence by an assignment made under the provisions of sub-</P>
<P>paragraph 3-E-1 above. If in the actual operation, a pilot is worked into one </P>
<P>or more of these day(s), such day(s) shall be restored to the pilot in </P>
<P>conjunction with the remaining days off and will not be disrupted without his </P>
<P>concurrence. In addition to this period of six (6) or seven (7) days off, these </P>
<P>international reserve lines will contain either two (2) periods of three (3) </P>
<P>days off or three (3) periods of two (2) days off. Except for the one six (6)</P>
<P>or seven (7) day off period, all other day off periods may be disrupted only </P>
<P>by an international assignment under sub-paragraph 3-E-1 above, or to </P>
<P>correct a month-end legality problem. When such disruption occurs, the </P>
<P>days off lost will be restored in the current month, if possible, but may be </P>
<P>restored in the following month, if necessary. Restoration of days off will not </P>
<P>be deferred beyond the following month unless further deferral is required </P>
<P>due to a conflict with (1) scheduled vacation, (2) training, (3) other schedule </P>
<B><P>PAGE 99</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>unavailability or (4) the inability to restore the days off owed without splitting </P>
<P>scheduled trip sequences. Days off will be in minimum groups of two days </P>
<P>provided the Company owes the pilot two or more days off. Single days off </P>
<P>may be restored or added to the pilot's vacation with his concurrence.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-8- </B>At domiciles where no international flying is assigned, a reserve will not </P>
<P>Be assigned an involuntary 8-L-6 assignment to perform international flying </P>
<P>at another domicile. When a new international domicile is established, the </P>
<P>parties will meet to determine the scheduling process necessary to insure </P>
<P>that the pilots who are assigned international flying meet the required </P>
<P>qualifications and necessary experience levels.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-9- </B>In the event the scheduled pilot becomes available after a reserve is</P>
<P>assigned and the reserve is no longer needed, the reserve assignment may </P>
<P>be canceled. When assigned to cover for a pilot on sick leave, reserves </P>
<P>shall call OPBCM within eight (8) hours of departure to verify the </P>
<P>assignment.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-10- </B>When released from duty upon completion of an international </P>
<P>assignment, a reserve will receive a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours free </P>
<P>from duty unless a greater rest is required by other provisions of this </P>
<P>Agreement.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-11- </B>In those international equipment domiciles that have both scheduled </P>
<P>Pacific and Atlantic DSL flying no reserve pilot will be assigned a trip pairing </P>
<P>containing an international Pacific flight segment within forty-eight (48) </P>
<P>hours of completion of a trip pairing containing an international Atlantic flight </P>
<P>segment. No reserve pilot will be assigned a trip pairing containing an </P>
<P>international Atlantic flight segment within sixty (60) hours of completion of a </P>
<P>trip pairing containing an international Pacific flight segment. No reserve will </P>
<P>be assigned or reassigned to fly in the European and Pacific operation in </P>
<P>any single trip pairing.</P>
<B><P>F. </B>The Company will not construct lines of flying which contain both one or more</P>
<P>international Atlantic flight segments and one or more international Pacific flight</P>
<P>segments except where full lines of flying cannot be constructed using </P>
<P>exclusively Atlantic or Pacific flying. In the event that both Atlantic and Pacific </P>
<P>flying is scheduled in the same line of flying the time between pairings will not be </P>
<P>less than sixty (60) hours between a pairing containing an international Atlantic </P>
<P>flight segment and a pairing containing an international Pacific flight segment, </P>
<P>and seventy-two (72) hours between a pairing containing an international Pacific </P>
<P>flight segment and a pairing containing an international Atlantic flight segment.</P>

<P>G. </B>The actual duty time limits of Paragraph A &amp; B above may be extended with </P>
<P>Pilot concurrence.</P>
<B><P>H. </B>On Basic and Augmented Crews, a Captain may be assigned as a First </P>
<P>Officer subject to the provisions of paragraph of the Agreement.</P>
<B><P>I. </B>If an augmenting crew member is required on any flight segment in a duty </P>
<P>period, he shall be required on all flight segments in that duty period. If the </P>
<P>scheduled flight time between any two (2) stations is such as to require </P>
<P>augmentation in one direction, then augmentation at the same level shall be </P>
<P>required on that segment when flown in the opposite direction. Notwithstanding, if </P>
<P>a flight requires augmentation due only to the application of 3-A-6-d, or 3-B-5-d, </P>
<P>the augmenting pilot shall be initially assigned to fly a comparable return flight, </P>
<P>but may be reassigned if required by the operation. The augmenting First Officer </P>
<P>who is displaced for any reason will not be assigned to another First officer </P>
<P>position on the trip from which he was displaced, or any other trip, without his </P>
<P>concurrence.</P>
<B><P>J. </B>Fuel Stops</P>
<P>A fuel stop required for operational reasons on any international trip segment, </P>
<P>Even though pre-planned on a recurring basis, shall not be considered as a </P>
<P>scheduled stop for any reason.</P>
<P>Should a fuel stop occur on any international segment, all pilots assigned to fly </P>
<P>That segment will receive an additional one (1) hour pay in addition to all other</P>
<P>compensation provided upon completion of fueling the crew continues flying </P>
<P>toward their original destination. Fuel stops will not be planned for less than forty </P>
<P>(40) minutes block-to-block. Further, when Dispatch forecasts a fuel stop on any</P>
<P>unaugmented Pacific crossing which was initially scheduled in excess of ten and </P>
<P>one-half (10 1/2) hours flight time, an augmenting crew member will be assigned </P>
<P>provided OPBCM receives at least six (6) hours notice.</P>
<B><P>K. </B>All flight time, duty time and segment limitations which are applicable to flying</P>
<P>under this Supplemental Agreement shall also apply to deadheading on the </P>
<P>same basis as if it were flying. In the actual operation, assignments which include </P>
<P>a duty period which consists solely of deadheading shall contain no more than </P>
<P>three (3) deadhead segments in that deadhead duty period.</P>
<B><P>L. </B>International lines of flying may be constructed which contain up to eighty-five </P>
<P>(85) credit hours. Additionally, no pilot will be scheduled or reassigned to perform </P>
<P>more than 4 Pacific or Atlantic crossings in a single trip pairing, or more than 2 </P>
<P>Pacific or Atlantic crossings of more than 10 hours in a single trip pairing. The </P>
<B><P>PAGE 101</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Local Schedule Committee, with the concurrence of the SSC and the Company, </P>
<P>may authorize the construction of lines of flying in any equipment domicile to </P>
<P>exceed the applicable monthly schedule limit by up to one (1) hour, provided the extended monthly schedule limit improves the quality of the affected lines. </P>
<P>(Should the monthly schedule limits be increased the actual performance limits </P>
<P>will be increased by an equal amount).</P>
<B><P>M. </B>Legal Rest Minimums.</P>
<B><P>M-1- </B>Duty periods which contain eight (8) or fewer hours of flight time shall</P>
<P>provide rest breaks in accordance with Section 5-G-1-c and 5-G-2-c of the</P>
<P>Agreement. Further, in the application of this provision, the occurrence of rest</P>
<P>breaks of 11:30 or less immediately following duty periods in excess of 12:00 will</P>
<P>be limited to one per pairing.</P>
<B><P>M-2- </B>Duty periods which contain more than eight (8) hours but twelve (12) hours</P>
<P>or less of scheduled flight time shall provide at least eighteen (18) hours free </P>
<P>from duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;With SSC concurrence on a monthly basis, this scheduled eighteen </P>
<P>(18) hour minimum may be reduced to sixteen (16) hours. (16:00 is to be </P>
<P>considered an actual minimum).</P>
<B><P>M-3- </B>Duty periods which contain more than twelve (12) hours of scheduled flight</P>
<P>time shall provide at least twenty (20) hours free from duty. With SSC </P>
<P>concurrence on a monthly basis, this scheduled twenty (20) hour minimum may </P>
<P>be reduced to eighteen (18) hours. (18:00 is to be considered an actual </P>
<P>minimum).</P>
<B><P>M-4- </B>If a trip pairing includes duty periods which are scheduled to contain more</P>
<P>than eight (8) hours of actual flight time for a basic crew or more than twelve (12)</P>
<P>hours of actual flight time for an augmented crew, there must be scheduled within</P>
<P>the pairing a crew layover of at least twenty-four (24) hours, block-to-block, at or</P>
<P>before the end of each second long duty period as defined herein.</P>
<B><P>M-5- </B>In addition to the above, at least sixteen (16) hours free from duty will be</P>
<P>scheduled prior to any duty period which is scheduled to contain more than eight</P>
<P>(8) hours of flight time or deadhead. With SSC concurrence on a monthly basis,</P>
<P>this scheduled sixteen (16) hour minimum may reduced to fourteen (14) hours.</P>
<P>(14:00 is to be considered an actual minimum).</P>
<B><P>M-6- </B>Upon completion of a trip pairing containing an Atlantic crossing(s) a pilot</P>
<P>shall receive a rest at home scheduled for no less than 24 hours (22 hours shall </P>
<P>be considered an actual minimum which may be further decreased to 21 hours </P>
<P>with pilot concurrence) which shall increase to 36 hours if the trip pairing contains </P>
<B><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Page 102</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than two duty periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, after completing a pairing containing a </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pacific crossing, a pilot will receive a rest at home of no less than 48 hours, </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which shall be extended to 72 hours after a trip pairing containing more than 6 </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duty periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, upon completion of a Pacific trip sequence which </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;originates and terminates on the mainland and which includes four (4) or more </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duty periods, but which does not include a ''Pacific Crossing'', a pilot shall </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receive a rest at his home domicile of no less than 48 hours, which shall be </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extended to 72 hours after a trip pairing containing more than six (6) duty </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;periods.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M-7- </B>Pilots flying international trip pairings shall be scheduled for one (1) </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty-four (24) hour period off in each seven (7) twenty-four (24) hour period </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;This time off, if given at an away from domicile point, shall not count </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward minimum days off.</P>
<B><P>N. </B>Report and Debrief Times</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N-1- </B>In order to assist in giving longer notice to reserves and to improve </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule integrity, each scheduled pilot shall be required to verify his intention </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to fly his next scheduled trip by: (1) following the trip verification procedure in </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CMS, which is accessible through Unimatic terminals and may be available </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through private PCs via MODEM; or (2) by calling OPBCM on a toll free </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number provided by the Company. One of these two actions must be </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplished not later than 24 hours before the scheduled departure of each </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;international trip, or upon termination of the pilot's prior trip, if later.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N-2- </B>When the originating segment of a trip sequence is known to be </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delayed, the Company will advise the scheduled crew prior to their check in.&nbsp;&nbsp;If </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such contact is attempted four (4) or more hours before the original scheduled </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;departure (or before the last planned departure time of which the pilot(s) was </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aware), the pilots on-duty period will not begin until one and one half (1 1/2) </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour before the revised departure. Further, if a delay develops within four (4) </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hours of scheduled departure and the pilot(s) is advised of the planned delay </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prior to his checking in at the airport, the start of his on duty period may also </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be adjusted as above.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the application of this provision, OPBCM will </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintain alternate phone numbers and will follow all reasonable instructions </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided by the pilot to facilitate reaching him.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N-3- </B>Duty time, on a scheduled or actual basis, shall include flight and ground</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time. A pilot shall be considered to be on duty one and one-half (1 1/2) hour </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the scheduled departure of his trip until thirty (30) minutes after the </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scheduled or actual termination of his trip, whichever is later. If the required </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reporting time exceeds one and one-half (1 1/2) hours, such time shall be </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considered as duty time.&nbsp;&nbsp;This paragraph shall not apply in the application of </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 5-G-1-b-(3) of the Agreement. If in the actual operation at certain </P>
<B><P>Page 103</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;airport locations the thirty (30) minutes debrief time is continually less than </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required, the parties agree to meet to discuss increasing the thirty (30) minutes </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a more reasonable amount of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The schedule and actual duty limits </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specified in 3-A, 3-B, 3-C and 3-D above may be increased up to thirty (30) </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes to accommodate the increased report time under this sub-paragraph </P>

<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J-2- </B>In addition to the provisions of Section 2-B-5, transportation to and from </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Hotel will be provided by full size air conditioned private vehicle </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(exclusively for crews) with normal safety equipment and qualified driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;The </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size of the vehicle will be commensurate with the needs of an International </P>

<B><P>K. </B>The Company will explore the possibility of obtaining a corporate membership </P>
<P>at a travelers or expatriate club which specializes in English-speaking </P>
<P>membership in Delhi for the purpose of providing pilots on layover with </P>
<P>membership services.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is committed to providing this service if </P>
<P>such services are available and can be acquired at a cost no greater than that </P>
<P>paid by other international airlines that provide their crews with such services in </P>
<P>Delhi.</P>
<B><P>L. </B>European or North American bottled drinking water meeting U.S. Health</P>
<P>Department standards for purity will be made available at the layover hotel to </P>
<P>layover crew members in India. Bottled water will also be made available to pilots </P>
<P>on flight segments operating to and from DEL.</P>
<B><P>M. </B>Aircraft used on flights to, from, or within India will have a priority lavatory lock</P>
<P>system (similar to the 747-400 system) installed within a reasonable period of </P>

<P>domicile for a legal rest within thirty-six (36) hours of his originally scheduled </P>
<P>arrival at his home domicile if reassigned while in the Atlantic operation and </P>
<P>within forty-eight (48) hours of his originally scheduled arrival at his home </P>

<P>assignment or sixty (60) hours in a Pacific assignment prior to his originally </P>
<P>scheduled arrival at his domicile, the reassignment as given will not delay his </P>

<B><P>Page 112</P>
</B><P>arrival at his home domicile if reassigned while in the Atlantic operation and for </P>
<P>more than sixty (60) hours of his originally scheduled arrival at his home domicile </P>
<P>if reassigned while in the Pacific operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a pilot is reassigned and </P>
<P>his arrival at his domicile will be later than originally scheduled, upon his request, </P>
<P>the Company shall notify the pilot's residence or contact number of the delay and </P>
<P>expected arrival time.</P>
<B><P>B. </B>The Association will be consulted and their recommendations will be given full</P>
<P>consideration whenever a new aircraft type is ordered which requires on-board </P>
<P>rest facilities as a result of this agreement or the FAR. The present B-747-400 </P>
<P>rest facility is considered to be optimally suited for aircraft operating within the </P>
<P>range of the B-747-400.</P>
<B><P>C</B>. Should a situation arise, either in the country or city served, that could present </P>
<P>a concern for the continued safety of the crew or aircraft, then representatives of </P>
<P>the Association and the Company will meet immediately to determine the most</P>
<P>appropriate action and/or modifications required, including the possibility that</P>
<P>additional insurance may be appropriate. In no event will a pilot assigned to </P>
<P>United's international operations suffer any reduction to his Company insurance </P>
<P>benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company agrees to protect a pilot from any reduction </P>
<P>in his personal life insurance benefits which may result from his assignment to </P>
<P>international operations at the time of his death up to a maximum of one million </P>
<P>dollars of total personal coverage.</P>
<B><P>D. </B>Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13 and 20 of the Agreement, any</P>
<P>lineholder who does not fly a scheduled international trip due to a sick leave </P>
<P>absence, is subject to the following:</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D-1- </B>Such pilot shall be eligible to restore all or part of his accrued sick leave</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used for the illness absence on an actual hour for actual hour basis.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D-2- </B>Restoration of sick leave accrual shall be accomplished by picking up </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open time under the provisions of Section 20-H-5 of the Agreement.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D-3- </B>Pick up under this provision shall be limited to the month in which the</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;absence occurs.</P>
<B><P>E</B>. Lost Luggage</P>
<P>If a crew member's luggage is lost by the Company while he is assigned an</P>
<P>international trip pairing or assigned to an international TDY domicile, then he </P>
<P>shall be subject to the policy regarding lost luggage applicable to revenue </P>
<P>passengers.&nbsp;&nbsp;An advance of Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00) will be </P>
<P>made available to a pilot under these circumstances. Such Two Hundred and </P>
<B><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Page 113</P>
</B><P>Fifty Dollars ($250.00) will be returned to the Company if his luggage is </P>
<P>recovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>F. </B>While on layover at a foreign location, crew members shall advise the local </P>
<P>United Station Operations of their whereabouts, if not residing at the scheduled </P>
<P>hotel.</P>
<B><P>G. </B>Should a pilot incur any foreign income tax liability as a result of an involuntary</P>
<P>TDY assignment, that liability will be assumed by the Company.</P>
<B><P>H. </B>Line preferencing information will be made available at one or more locations</P>
<P>where crews layover who are flying trip pairings of five (5) or more days duration.</P>
<P>Schedule preferences will be accepted by telemeter from all such crews who will </P>
<P>not return to their domicile before close of preferencing.</P>
<B><P>I. </B>Should government action modify any existing United Airlines route, the parties </P>
<P>will meet to discuss the possible need to make modifications to this </P>
<P>Supplemental Agreement.</P>
<B><P>J. </B>The Company will consult with the Association Hotel Committee prior to </P>
<P>changing any currently approved international layover facility. Whenever changes </P>
<P>are contemplated, at the request of the ALPA Hotel Committee Chairman, a</P>
<P>representative of Flight Operations will inspect the proposed facility prior to the</P>
<P>change taking place.</P>
<B><P>K. </B>The Company will provide the names of English speaking doctors and medical</P>
<P>facilities which are available 24 hours. A priority will be placed on finding doctors </P>
<P>and facilities which are convenient to the layover hotel and with whom </P>
<P>arrangements can be made which will eliminate the possibility that the pilot will </P>
<P>be required to provide immediate payment for treatment; including arrangements </P>
<P>which would require the pilot to later reimburse the Company for advancing </P>
<P>payment on his behalf.</P>
<B><P>L. </B>The Company and the Association will conduct a second joint medical study</P>
<P>regarding crew rest. The Company commits that scheduling practices and</P>
<P>philosophies no less favorable to the pilots than those in effect January 15, 1991 </P>
<P>shall remain in effect pending the results of this second crew rest study.</P>
<B><P>M. </B>Should international scheduling problems occur, the parties will meet to </P>
<P>attempt to resolve the problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, should the Federal Aviation </P>
<P>Administration modify the current FAR's, the parties will meet for the purpose of </P>
<P>determining what changes, if any, should be made to this International </P>
<P>Supplemental Letter of Agreement to conform with the new regulations.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Page 114</P>
<P>N. </B>Whenever a new aircraft type is ordered which requires an on-board rest </P>

<P>Dear Captain Babbitt:</P>
<P>This will confirm that in the negotiations leading to the 1991 Pilot Agreement, the</P>
<P>Company and the United Airlines' Master Executive Council Negotiating </P>
<P>Committee agreed that prior to implementing any twin engine ETOPS operations </P>
<P>in the Pacific Basin, the parties will meet to review the ETOPS experience gained </P>
<P>in the Atlantic Operation and reach agreement on any changes in the </P>
<P>International Supplemental Agreement necessary to initiate such flying.</P>
<P>It was further agreed that should the Company receive any new European route</P>
<P>authority during the term of the 1991 agreement which could not be operated </P>
<P>under the Atlantic provisions of the International Supplemental Agreement the </P>
<P>parties will promptly meet and agree on such changes in the agreement </P>
<P>necessary to implement such new service. (Such changes could include, but not </P>
<P>be limited to, additional crew augmentation).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>TO: ALL FLIGHT OFFICERS AFFECTED BY TEMPORARY CESSATION OF </P>
<P>WORK</P>
<P>The purpose of this notice is to outline your status with regard to compensation </P>
<P>and benefits during this period of work cessation. You will be returned to service </P>
<P>as soon as possible after our services have been restored and work becomes </P>
<P>available.</P>
<P>If the____________________________strikes, you will be continued on pay </P>
<P>status through the___________day after the cessation of work. This period of </P>
<P>pay status may be extended if, after discussion with the Association, it is </P>
<P>determined that a longer period is operationally necessary. Pilots will be returned </P>
<P>to their home domicile or UA station nearest their home at no expense to </P>
<P>themselves. Pilots may be required to fly crew ferries to accomplish this </P>
<P>requirement. It is understood that a pilot who is not returned to his domicile will </P>
<P>continue to be on pay status until he is actually returned to his domicile or on the </P>
<P>basis of planned arrival time at this domicile, if the pilot requests to remain at an </P>
<P>outer station for personal reasons.</P>
<B><P>1. </B><U>Address and Telephone Number</P>
</U><P>You should be sure your Flight Office has your present address and telephone </P>

<B><P>4. </B><U>Bids and Preferencing</P>
</U><P>Although the strike may require changes in the planned activations, activations </P>
<P>Will continue for pilots who are qualified to assume their new assignment and </P>
<P>who possess a notice of activation which has not been cancelled. All other pilots </P>
<P>will be retained in their equipment, status and domicile assignment as of the date </P>
<P>of the cessation of work. For the purpose of line assignment upon resumption of </P>
<P>service, the Company shall continue to post schedules, comprised of the </P>
<P>Company's planned operation, for pilot preferencing during the period of the </P>
<P>strike. Pilots will not be required to cross a picket line in order to preference </P>

<B><P>6. </B><U>Sick Leave</P>

<P>due to illness during their normal working hours. If you are ill during the cessation </P>
<P>of work, you are not entitled to either occupational or non-occupational sick leave </P>
<P>pay. However, pilots exhausting sick leave prior to permanent grounding will </P>
<P>continue to receive the remainder of their accrued sick leave during the cessation </P>
<P>of work. Also, continuation of occupational or non-occupational sick leave pay for </P>
<P>hardship cases will be considered jointly by the Company and the Association on </P>
<P>an individual basis.</P>

<P>participant's earnings, the denominator shall not include those months for which </P>
<P>earnings have been disregarded in accordance with this provision.</P>

<P>Captain F. C. Dubinsky, Chairman</P>
<P>UA/ALPA Master Executive Council</P>
<P>Air Line Pilots Association, International</P>
<P>10700 W. Higgins Road, Suite 200</P>
<P>Rosemont, IL 60018</P>
<P>Dear Captain Dubinsky:</P>
<P>Because the Command/Leadership/Resource Management Seminar Training </P>
<P>Program is a new concept in the airline industry, it is necessary to have an </P>
<P>understanding of the application of some provisions of the Agreement. This </P>
<P>Letter of Understanding outlines these provisions and other stipulations as they </P>
<P>apply to pilots involved in C/L/ R seminar training.</P>
<B><P>1. </B>Compensation - Compensation will be paid in accordance with Section 9 of the</P>
<P>Agreement.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>Expenses - Meal expense in accordance with Section 4-A-1 of the Agreement </P>
<P>will be paid, minus the actual expense incurred by the Company for meals </P>
<P>provided during the training session. Reasonable actual ground transportation </P>
<P>expenses will be paid between the airport and the location of the C/L/R seminar </P>
<P>training. Lodging will be provided by the Company.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>Duty Day - In order for training to be effective, long duty days are a basic</P>
<P>requirement for the C/L/R seminar program. The normal contractual training </P>
<P>schedule requirements of the Basic and Supplemental Agreements will not apply. </P>
<P>In any event, no duty day shall exceed 14:15 hours except by consent of the </P>
<P>participants.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>Assignment to Training - Notification and assignment to seminar training will </P>
<P>be prior to pilot schedule preferencing whenever practical, but in no case less </P>
<P>than seven (7) days prior to commencement of Command/Leadership/Resource </P>
<P>Management Seminar Training. Short notice scheduling will be limited to cases </P>
<P>where a previously scheduled pilot has had to cancel his/her training for any </P>
<P>reason.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Page 152</P>
<P>5. </B>Completion of Training - Upon completion of C/L/R seminar training, a pilot will </P>
<P>be given not less than one (1) calendar day free of all duty at his home domicile, </P>
<P>provided he is not scheduled for such time off in his line of flying or as a reserve. </P>
<P>The pilot will be given pay and flight time credit for any trip(s) he must drop to </P>
<P>provide such calendar day off.</P>
<B><P>6. </B>Alternates for Seminars - Alternates will be scheduled for each seminar. Pilots </P>
<P>who are designated as alternates will be scheduled for two seminars, </P>
<P>approximately two weeks apart. Designated alternates will stand by for the first of </P>
<P>these seminars, and if they are released to return to their domicile, will attend </P>
<P>and participate as a scheduled attendee in the second seminar approximately </P>
<P>two weeks later. Alternates will be given pay and flight time credit for any trip(s) </P>
<P>they must drop for their regularly scheduled seminar and for the preceding </P>
<P>seminar for which they are designated as an alternate. Pilots who are scheduled </P>
<P>but do not attend, and are replaced by an alternate, will be scheduled </P>
<P>approximately two weeks later in the seminar for which the alternate was </P>
<P>scheduled as a regular participant</P>
<B><P>7. </B>Modifications to C/L/R Seminar Training - to retain ALPA support for the </P>
<P>program, the Company and ALPA must agree on any subsequent modifications.</P>
<B><P>8. </B>Disciplinary Action - No information resulting from a pilot's participation in a </P>
<P>C/L/R seminar may be used in any disciplinary action nor may be used in any </P>
<P>way to the detriment of any United pilot.</P>
<B><P>9. </B>Record Keeping - No records of pilot performance during C/L/R seminar </P>
<P>training will be kept by anyone inside or outside the Company.</P>
<B><P>10. </B>Additional Phases of C/L/R Training - Development of any additional phases </P>
<P>of C/L/R training will be with full participation by ALPA representatives and will </P>
<P>not be implemented without review by the United MEC, or its Officers.</P>

<P>THIS LETTER OF AGREEMENT is made and entered into in accordance with </P>
<P>the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, by and between UNITED </P>
<P>AIRLINES, INC. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") and the AIR LINE </P>
<P>PILOTS in the service of UNITED AIRLINES, INC., as represented by the AIR </P>
<P>LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL (hereinafter referred to as the </P>
<P>"Association").</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">W I T N E S S E T H:</P>
<P>NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed:</P>
<B><P>1. </B>The MEC Officers shall be paid, at the appropriate hourly pay rates, for eighty-</P>
<P>one (81) hours, or eighty-five (85) hours if holding an international assignment, </P>
<P>plus the value of any legal inbound each month during their terms. During such </P>
<P>term of office, the Company will not assign specific vacation periods to the </P>
<P>Officers with the understanding that it is the responsibility of each MEC Officer to </P>
<P>arrange for the vacation time off which he is due. At the beginning of each </P>
<P>vacation year, Officers will be provided written notification of their responsibilities </P>
<P>under this provision. Upon returning to line flying at the end of his term of office, </P>
<P>all vacation due to each Officer in the current and prior vacation years will be </P>
<P>considered to have been assigned and taken. Full time National Officers also </P>
<P>shall be subject to this vacation procedure.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>The pilot members of the ALPA Negotiating Committee shall be displaced from </P>
<P>their scheduled trips when meeting with the Company during the term of this </P>
<P>Agreement. During Section 6 negotiations, or during other negotiations that are </P>
<P>anticipated to cover a monthly bid period, the pilot members of the Negotiating </P>
<P>Committee shall be paid, at the appropriate hourly pay rates, for eighty-one (81) </P>
<P>hours, or eighty-five (85) hours if holding an international assignment, plus the </P>
<P>value of any legal inbound for the duration of those negotiations.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>When required to attend formal meetings with the Company in their capacity </P>
<P>as MEC Committee Members, the pilot members of the System Schedule </P>
<P>Committee, the Central Air Safety Committee, the Retirement and Insurance </P>
<P>Committee, the Hotel Committee (not including hotel inspections) and the </P>
<P>Employee Assistance Committee shall be displaced from their schedules in order </P>
<P>to attend such meetings.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 20-H, any LEC Officer shall be </P>
<P>permitted to trade a trip from his line of flying for any other trip which is in "open </P>
<P>flying" in order to make himself available to conduct ALPA business.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Page 158</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>5. </B>Any LEC Officer may request to be displaced from his trip(s) for the purpose of</P>
<P>conducting Association business. His Flight Manager will determine if such</P>
<P>displacement(s) is possible, based upon the availability of management pilots </P>
<P>who have a need to perform such flying. Trips which are not covered by </P>
<P>management pilots on a displacement basis are subject to the existing procedure </P>
<P>covering dropped trips for Association business.</P>
<B><P>6. </B>When pilots are removed from schedule at ALPA request, except when</P>
<P>displacement is provided by this Letter of Agreement, the Company shall pay </P>
<P>each such pilot as if he had performed his scheduled duties and will then bill </P>
<P>ALPA for the amount of flight pay associated with those dropped trips, including </P>
<P>the actual cost of fringe benefits.</P>
<B><P>7. </B>When a special MEC meeting is held for the purpose of conducting business </P>
<P>at the Company's request, the Company will pay all flight pay loss incurred as a </P>
<P>result of that meeting.</P>
<P>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have signed this Letter of Agreement this </P>
<P>9<SUP>th</SUP> day of May, 1991.</P>

<P>Dear Rick:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As a result of a recent grievance, the parties were made aware that it would be </P>
<P>useful to have a mutually agreed-to definition of the activation date of a pilot who </P>
<P>changes equipment and/or status. In discussions between the ALPA and </P>
<P>Company Negotiating Committees, it has been agreed that, for all purposes </P>
<P>related to the administration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, a pilot shall </P>
<P>be considered activated in his new assignment at the beginning of the first </P>
<P>segment of his IOE. It is recognized that the pilot's pay may be changed prior to </P>
<P>activation as the result of the application of other provisions of the Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If the pilot's activation is delayed and he becomes entitled to a bump, his </P>
<P>Entitlement to bump shall expire if his bump is not received by the Company prior </P>
<P>to his first segment of IOE. In the event the pilot does not successfully complete </P>
<P>his IOE, his activation shall be cancelled; however any expired bump entitlement </P>
<P>will not be reinstated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dear Roger:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This is to confirm the agreement reached between United Airlines, Inc. ("United") </P>
<P>and the Air Line Pilots Association, International (the "Association") regarding </P>
<P>post-retirement medical insurance for former Pan American World Airways ("Pan </P>
<P>Am") pilots hired in connection with the Pacific and London route acquisitions, </P>
<P>Including such pilots who have already retired (the "Former Pan Am Pilots").</P>
<P>In lieu of any contrary provisions in the purchase agreements between United </P>
<P>and Pan Am or in other agreements between United and the Association, the </P>
<P>following rules shall apply to the Former Pan Am Pilots effective as of date of </P>
<P>signing.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. </B>Former Pan Am Pilots who have or had ten or more years of active service </P>
<P>with United at the time of actual retirement shall be eligible for retiree medical </P>
<P>insurance coverage in the same manner as all other United pilots who have </P>
<P>also satisfied the normal ten year service requirement, provided that, for the </P>
<P>sole purpose of determining the percentage of annual cost to be paid by the </P>
<P>retiree, as set forth in Letter 91-1 at paragraph A-2-I, such Former Pan Am </P>
<P>Pilots will be deemed to have length of service equal to their combined Pan </P>
<P>Am and United active service.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. </B>Former Pan Am Pilots who have or had less than ten years of active service </P>
<P>with United at the time of actual retirement shall be eligible to purchase retiree </P>
<P>medical insurance coverage at the actual cost of the insurance, as determined by </P>
<P>United's average cost of providing the same benefit to other pilots who have </P>
<P>satisfied the service requirement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Air Line Pilots Association</P>
<P>6400 Shafer Court, Suite 700</P>
<P>Rosemont, IL 60018</P>
<P>Dear Roger,</P>
<P>The Company and the Association engaged in a cooperative experiment to find a</P>
<P>way to assign field standby assignments more often to the reserve pilots who</P>
<P>desired such assignments. The parties have now successfully concluded that</P>
<P>experiment and herein agree to the following provisions to formalize the process.</P>
<B><P>1. </B>Reserve standby lines will be identified and posted at the regular preferencing</P>
<P>time, showing day on / day off patterns (minimum 12 days off). The number of</P>
<P>standby lines will be determined by the Company and may be between zero and</P>
<P>a maximum of three for each status, equipment and domicile. The standby lines</P>
<P>will not be counted as part of the number of reserve lines referred to in 5-G-1-e.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>Awards to standby lines will be strictly voluntary and will occur after all other</P>
<P>preferencing activity. Reserves who are available for the full month will have</P>
<P>priority, by seniority, for standby lines. Volunteer reserve pilots with absences</P>
<P>will be awarded an unfilled standby reserve line for the period of the month for</P>
<P>which they are available. The portion of the standby reserve line for which the</P>
<P>reserve is unavailable due to his absence will remain unassigned.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>A scheduled standby assignment will be subject to the provisions of 5-G-5 and</P>
<P>shall be treated as a scheduled reserve day for the purpose of absence</P>
<P>accounting; specifically:</P>
<B><P>3-a- </B>Five hours actual time and pay credit will be credited, if no trip is assigned.</P>
<B><P>3-b- </B>If a standby pilot is assigned a trip, the actual flight time of the completed</P>
<P>trip will be credited.</P>
<B><P>3-c- </B>Four hours ten minutes (4:10) will be reduced from the pilot's available</P>
<P>monthly maximum flight time for each scheduled standby day for which the pilot</P>
<P>is absent (sick, vacation, military, etc.)</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Page 75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</TABLE>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>4. </B>Standby times following a day off will start at 16:00 local time. Standby times</P>
<P>for the day preceding a scheduled day off will be at 07:00, except if legalities</P>
<P>require a later start time. If the pilot cannot start before 12:00, he will be free from</P>
<P>duty for that last day.</P>
<B><P>5. </B>Standby reserves can be "converted" to regular reserves if no other reserve is</P>
<P>available for an assignment. The Company can make a trip assignment which</P>
<P>begins prior to a field standby period with pilot concurrence. The Company has the right to make an assignment which begins later than the scheduled field standby period, if the pilot is contacted prior to reporting for the standby period.</P>
<B><P>6. </B>Fourteen hours will be scheduled between standby assignments. A twelve</P>
<P>hour minimum from block in to standby report time will be provided in the actual</P>
<P>operation. If one flight assignment makes a pilot illegal for the next scheduled</P>
<P>field standby assignment, that next standby time can be delayed to provide a</P>
<P>legal rest.</P>
<B><P>7. </B>Up to five days of open flying can be added to each standby line</P>
<P>after preferencing on scheduled standby days only. Such assignments will be</P>
<P>offered in seniority order, taking into consideration each pilot's available standby</P>
<P>days. Preassigned open flying under this paragraph will normally be conducted</P>
<P>during the first period of available days in the month and no standby pilot will be</P>
<P>required to perform a preassinged trip which departs prior to 16:00 on his first</P>
<P>scheduled available day of the month.</P>
<B><P>8. </B>The assignment of open flying under 7, above, and the publication of the field</P>
<P>standby times will be completed by the 28th of the prior month. The CMS</P>
<P>"DSPREC" display will not indicate times for field standbys until the 28th of the</P>
<P>prior month.</P>
<B><P>9. </B>A standby reserve assignment can be converted into an additional day off,</P>
<P>provided the Company provides notice to the pilot at or prior to the end of the</P>
<P>immediately preceding assignment. At the end of each assignment, each pilot</P>
<P>will be obligated to check his "CALREC" display to determine if he has been</P>
<P>released from his next standby assignment.</P>
<B><P>10. </B>Regular reserves can continue to be called out at any time for standby</P>
<P>assignments, as provided by the Agreement.</P>
<B><P>11. </B>If this letter is ratified prior to November 1, 1992, it is anticipated that this</P>
<P>system can be implemented as part of the regular preferencing system by</P>
<P>January, 1993, for the schedule month of February, 1993.</P>

<P>Dear Roger,</P>
<P>As a result of discussions between the ALPA and Company Negotiating</P>
<P>Committees, it has been agreed that a pilot will be permitted to trade trips from</P>
<P>his awarded schedule with trips which are in "open flying", as follows:</P>
<B><P>1.</B> A pilot will be permitted to trade a trip(s), for which he is available in his</P>
<P>awarded schedule, with a trip(s) from open flying once per month. That single</P>
<P>trade transaction can include a single trip or multiple trip pairings from his</P>
<P>line, so long as they are contiguous (i.e., include no intervening days off). He</P>
<P>may trade that trip or series of "back-to-back" trips from his line with open</P>
<P>flying for a single trip or multiple trips.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>A pilot will not be permitted to trade for a trip which would create an illegality in</P>
<P>his remaining scheduled line in any month for which the schedule has been</P>
<P>awarded. Further, a trade will not be permitted if it projects a pilot above</P>
<P>81/83/85 actual flight hours (whichever is applicable to him under the</P>
<P>Agreement) or above 85 pay credit hours, unless he is already projected above</P>
<P>85 pay credit hours due to the month-end operation of a legal inbound trip from</P>
<P>the prior month. If the pilot is projected for more than 85 pay credit hours, he</P>
<P>may make a trade which will also project him to that established higher value.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>Automated trades can be processed through any Unimatic terminal or through</P>
<P>Unimatic access by home computers. Automated trades will be accepted only for</P>
<P>transactions which are outside of the "current period", i.e., for trips which are</P>
<P>scheduled to depart more than 28 hours in the future.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>Automated trades will be accepted or rejected by the CMS system at the time</P>
<P>the request is made and, if accepted, the pilot will be considered to be on notice</P>
<P>that his schedule has been changed and he has accepted responsibility for his</P>
<P>revised schedule.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>5. </B>A pilot will not be permitted to trade out of any trip in his awarded line (1) which</P>
<P>is scheduled to depart within the first five days of the schedule month or, (2)</P>
<P>which is scheduled to operate during any of the holidays recognized by the</P>
<P>Agreement or, (3) which is scheduled to operate during any of the other days</P>
<P>which may be "embargoed" by the Company. Embargoes may be declared by</P>
<P>the Company for specific days by status, domicile and equipment type and</P>
<P>notice of such embargoes will be noted on designated CMS "Display Pages". As</P>
<P>coverage availability changes during theoperating month, embargo changes</P>
<P>may also be made by the Company - both to impose additional embargoes and</P>
<P>to lift existing embargoes. None of the restrictions in this paragraph 5 will limit</P>
<P>which trips, scheduled on an embargoed day, a pilot will be permitted to trade</P>
<P>into.</P>
<B><P>6. </B>A pilot will not be permitted to trade out of any trip in his OE line, nor out of any</P>
<P>trip on which he is scheduled for an en route check or for any training.</P>
<B><P>7. </B>A "first come, first served" trip trade process, described in Paragraph 3 &amp; 4</P>
<P>above will be implemented no later than September 1, 1993. This "first come,</P>
<P>first served" system will cease when the "Seniority Concept" trip trade system is</P>
<P>implemented.</P>
<P>The Company will, immediately upon MEC ratification of this</P>
<P>Agreement, begin the computer programming necessary to implement the ALPA</P>
<P>"Seniority Concept". This seniority based trip trade process, described in</P>
<P>alternate paragraphs paragraph 3 &amp; 4 below, will be implemented no later than</P>
<P>February 1, 1994 (at which time paragraph 3 and 4 above, will cease).</P>
<B><P>3. </B>Trade requests will be processed through any Unimatic terminal or through</P>
<P>Unimatic access by home computers. Trades will be accepted only for</P>
<P>Transactions which affect trips that are scheduled to depart more than 48 hours</P>
<P>after the next daily "rundown" is conducted. A pilot will not be permitted to trade</P>
<P>out of a trip which is scheduled to depart less than 48 hours after the next daily</P>
<P>"rundown" is conducted.</P>
<B><P>4.a. </B>A "rundown" is the daily process during which trip trades on file are</P>
<P>programmatically processed. A "rundown" of trade requests will be conducted</P>
<P>daily at a fixed time; currently planned to be 1300 Central Time. All trade</P>
<P>requests not awarded will remain in the computer until awarded or removed by</P>
<P>the pilot.</P>

<P>Unless otherwise specified, all capitalized terms in this letter are defined in</P>
<P>Section 1 of the Agreement.</P>
<P>UAL agrees that it is an Affiliate of United and that it is bound by Section 1 of the</P>
<P>Agreement in the same manner as United so that every reference to the</P>
<P>"Company" in Section 1 expressly refers to and binds UAL. United and UAL further agree that they will not conclude, facilitate or permit any agreement or arrangement that establishes any Affiliate, other than a Feeder Carrier, that is, Controls or is
under the Control of an air carrier unless the Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by Section 1 of the Agreement in the same manner as UAL and United.</P>
<P>Any disputes among ALPA, United and/or UAL that arise out of grievances or that concern the interpretation or application of this letter or Section 1 of the </P>

<P>Dear Captain Babbitt:</P>
<P>I write to confirm the following agreement made between the Air Line Pilots</P>
<P>Association, International ("ALPA") and United Air Lines, Inc. ("United") in the</P>
<P>negotiations leading to the 1994 ALPA-United collective bargaining agreement</P>
<P>(the "Agreement"). Unless otherwise specified, all capitalized terms in this letter are defined in Section 1 of the Agreement.</P>
<B><P>1. </B>Subject to the corporate governance provisions established in the Company's</P>
<P>Charter and By-Laws, a process or means will be established that will permit</P>
<P>ALPA and the new management to resolve issues creating disharmony between</P>
<P>pilots and management on a basis that will not reduce the value of the pilot</P>
<P>investment in the 1994 Employee Stock Ownership Transaction.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>Subject to other legal obligations, the Company will make reasonable efforts to</P>
<P>fill pilot vacancies with the individuals who satisfy United's hiring standards, who</P>
<P>have, previously worked for carriers represented by ALPA, and who are no</P>
<P>longer working for those carriers for economic reasons such as lay-offs or the</P>
<P>shutdown of that carrier.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>assigned trips as a reserve and always be placed at the top of the FIFO list</P>
<P>after returning from a trip or days off. Such pilot shall receive 15 hours free</P>
<P>of duty after each assignment, unless the pilot is the only reserve available,</P>
<P>in which case the normal provisions of the Agreement shall apply. If</P>
<P>multiple initial pilots are on reserve, they will return to the top of the FIFO</P>
<P>list in FIFO order. A pilot may be passed over on the FIFO list to avoid an</P>
<P>assignment with another initial or transition crew member.</P>
<B><P>17-b- </B>A pilot holding a Captain or a First Officer Shuttle bid will initially be</P>
<P>assigned to a Mainline trip(s) in order to accomplish the majority of his</P>
<P>IOE; however, in no case will a Shuttle pilot receive less than 7 Shuttle</P>
<P>landings during his IOE. A pilot holding a Captain or a First Officer Mainline</P>
<P>bid will never be assigned to a Shuttle trip(s) for IOE.</P>
<B><P>17-c- </B>A Shuttle pilot's IOE shall consist of no less than twenty-five (25)</P>
<P>hard hours except for transitioning B737-200 pilots who will require a</P>
<P>minimum of segments.</P>
<B><P>17-d- </B>When a Shuttle pilot's IOE is completed prior to the conclusion of a</P>
<P>multi-day duty period trip, the pilot may be removed from the I.D. only at</P>
<P>the end of a duty period.</P>

<P>perform Mainline IOE if no Mainline LCA is available, up to a maximum of one</P>
<P>Mainline IOE per month per Shuttle LCA.</P>

<P>Dear Hal,</P>
<P>Attached is a document that the parties have agreed accurately explains the</P>
<P>November 22, 1994 Letter of Agreement regarding the "Month-End Absence</P>
<P>Rule."</P>
<P>In accordance with our mutual commitment to give wide distribution to</P>
<P>this information, it will be included with the Letters of Agreement to be published</P>
<P>as an addendum to the current Collective Bargaining Agreement booklet.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Month-End Absence Rule</P>
</B><P>Since the 1981 Agreement, the Company has had the right to unilaterally adjust</P>
<P>pilot schedules in order to make them legal from month to month. Once this</P>
<P>month end adjustment is made, any absence over the month end that develops</P>
<P>thereafter is paid on the basis of the adjusted, legal schedules, as they occur in</P>
<P>both months. Shortly after this provision became effective with the 1981</P>
<P>Agreement, ALPA and the Company agreed to an interpretation of this provision</P>
<P>Intended to deal with concerns both parties had about schedule repairs that</P>
<P>might be made under the new provision when the affected pilot was planned to</P>
<P>be absent (vacation, training, etc.) at the beginning of a month. In order to avoid</P>
<P>having changes occur to an absent pilot's schedule that he couldn't control and</P>
<P>might not even have an opportunity to know about (e.g.; in the case of long term</P>
<P>sick leave), it was decided that for most planned absences in a pilot's schedule</P>
<P>that spanned a month-end or began on the first of a month, the pay for both the</P>
<P>old month (month "A") and new month (month "B") would be based entirely</P>

</TABLE>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>on what the pilot's published schedule included in these two months, as</P>
<P>awarded, without giving any consideration to the usual effect of month-end</P>
<P>carry overs or conflicts - if and when any conflicts existed. This means that the</P>
<P>pay forany carry-over trip from month "A" to month "B" is cut off at midnight at</P>
<P>month end;<B> </B>however, all trips at the beginning of month "B" are paid, even if the carry-over trip normally would have been in conflict.</P>
<P>The basic rule is: If, at the time the Company reconciles month-end schedule </P>
<P>conflicts created by carryover trips from the current month (month "A"), a pilot</P>
<P>has a known absence either over the upcoming month end or beginning on the</P>
<P>first day of the following month (month "B', then the Company will not repair that</P>
<P>pilot's month end schedule conflict, if one exists. In this case, the pilot's pay for</P>
<P>both months will be based on the pay value of the trips or portions of trips which</P>
<P>appear in his awarded schedules as published for both months. All that is</P>
<P>necessary for this rule to apply is for there to be a qualifying absence when</P>
<P>month-end conflicts are being worked on; when there is, this process always will</P>
<P>be followed and the pay will be split at midnight</P>
<P>at month end, whether or not the two months' schedules would have been in</P>
<P>conflict. Some special cases:</P>
<P>a. This above general rule also applies when the absence in month "B" does not</P>
<P>begin on the very first day of the month, provided the carry-over trip from month "A" projects into the absence.</P>
<P>b. It is possible, though rare, for a very long trip at the end of month "A" to satisfy</P>
<P>the circumstances described in "a", above, and also to entirely transcend a</P>
<P>shorter trip at the beginning of month "B" that does not touch the absence. (E.g.,</P>
<P>an 8 day trip beginning on the 31st of month "A", a 4 day trip beginning on the</P>
<P>1st of month "B" and a vacation beginning on the 6th of month "B".) In this case,</P>
<P>this month-end pay rule continues to apply, however the pilot would be legal, in</P>
<P>position and expected to fly the 4 day trip on the 1st.</P>
<P>c. Another variation on "a.", above that bears mentioning is created when the</P>
<P>carryover trip from month "A" does not project into the absence, but the carryover</P>
<P>trip conflicts with a trip at the beginning of month "B" that does project into the</P>
<P>absence. (E.g., a 3 day trip beginning on the 31st of month "A", a 4 day trip</P>
<P>beginning on the 2nd of month "B" and a vacation beginning on the 5th of month</P>
<P>"B".) This is not really a special case; since, in this situation, there is no</P>
<P>application of this month-end absence rule because neither of the required</P>
<P>conditions is met: There is no absence beginning on the first of month "B" nor</P>
<P>does the carry-over trip project into the vacation period. In this case, the</P>
<P>carryover trip and the first trip in the pilots line for month "B" require regular</P>
<P>month-end repair since the pilot will fly the carryover trip and cannot also get</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>paid for the conflicting trip in month "B"- even though he would not have flown the</P>
<P>trip in month "B" because it projects into the absence.</P>
<P>d. In the event a pilot is on sick leave at the beginning of an outbound trip at the</P>
<P>end of month "A" that qualified him for the application of this "month-end absence</P>
<P>rule" due to having a vacation beginning early in month "B" the pay for the</P>
<P>outbound portion of any carryover trip that appears in month "A" that projects into</P>
<P>the vacation shall be paid as vacation instead of sick leave.</P>
<P>e. This "month-end absence" rule will not be applied to pilots whose planned</P>
<P>absences are due to an ALPA drop (such as attendance at a System Schedule</P>
<P>Committee meeting) or to a Company business drop (such as a special</P>
<P>assignment). For those two types of planned absences only, month-end conflict</P>
<P>resolution will take place as if the pilot were expected to perform the month-end</P>
<P>flying.</P>
<P>3. The Association will co-sponsor the distribution of the above rules, acknowledging ALPA's agreement with this month-end application and, thereafter, both ALPA and the Company will continue to publicize these rules so that pilots with month-end
absences</P>
<P>will have accurate information about how to preference schedules when they have such absences. The Company will include a reminder with each month's schedule preferencing package to alert pilots to these special month end absence rules.</P>

<P>Dear Harlow,</P>
<P>The parties have mutually agreed to the following provisions as an addition to Section 20-E of the Agreement in order to accommodate the effect of the new FAR that imposes new limitations on crew composition involving Captains and First Officers who
have less than seventy-five (75) flight hours of PIC or SIC time in that equipment type after completing transition training. The fallowing provisions apply only to Captains and First Officers who are not "initial" Captains and First Officers; the
provisions of Section 20-E continue to apply to "operating experience" for initial Captains and First Officers.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6-A-2 and Section 20-B-1-f, Captains and First Officers shall be subject to the following schedule and reserve assignment provisions if, at the time the line or trip assignment is made, the Captain or First
Officer has not yet performed seventy-five (75) hours of flying as Pilot in Command or as Second in Command in his current aircraft type.</P>
<B><P>1.</P>
<P>1-a- </B>If a Captain is senior enough to be awarded a primary line of flying through</P>
<P>preferencing upon his activation into his new Captain assignment, and if he does</P>
<P>preference and is awarded such a line, that line shall become his "OE" line.</P>
<B><P>1-b- </B>If a First Officer is senior enough to be awarded a primary line of flying</P>
<P>through preferencing upon his activation into a new First Officer assignment, and if he does preference and is awarded such a line, that line shall become his "OE" line providing that the Captain holding the same line has completed seventy-five (75)
hours as PIC or SIC in that equipment type at the time the monthly schedule assignment is being made. In the event the First Officers preference would normally result in his being awarded a line with a Captain who has not fulfilled the above seventy five
(75) hour requirement, the First Officer will be awarded the next available line, according to his preference, to which the assigned Captain has satisfied the seventy five (75) hour requirement.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>Lineholder Captains and First Officers who have not accumulated seventy-five (75) hours in their current assignment shall not be eligible to trip trade into an assignment which dines not comply with the above requirement, nor into an
assignment in which the other pilot position is "open".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Letter 9-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 108</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>3. </B>If the newly transitioned Captain or First Officer does not have sufficient seniority to be awarded a line of flying under "1.", above, the Captain or First Officer will be awarded the reserve line to which his seniority entitles him.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>Newly transitioned Captains and First Officers who have not accumulated seventy-five (75) hours as PIC or SIC in their current type at the time the assignment is made will not be eligible to be awarded secondary lines.</P>
<B><P>5. </B>A newly transitioned Captain or First Officer who is a reserve and who has not</P>
<P>accumulated seventy-five (75) hours in his current equipment type may be bypassed in the FIFO assignment rotation in order to be assigned flying which does not violate the seventy-five (75) hour requirement. Further, such Captain or First Officer may,
at his request, be placed at the top of the FIFO list until he has acquired seventy-five (75) hours in his current assignment. Each pilot who requests to be placed at the top of the list will be placed just below all other pilots who previously requested
such placement.</P>
<B><P>6. </B>Newly transitioned Captains and First Officers who have not accumulated seventy-five (75) hours in their current equipment type and who do not have a line or reserve assignment for the current month at the time they complete JOE, may be
assigned to reserve or to an existing partial line or to a partial line created for them from open flying that does not violate the seventy-five (75) hour requirement. All trip pairings assigned to pilots who have not completed the seventy-five (75) hour
requirement must, at the time of assignment, fall into one of the following groups: (1) a complete DSL published sequence, (2) a portion of a single published sequence or (3) any sequence to which a complete crew is assigned as a unit.</P>

<P>Dear Mike,</P>
<P>As a result of the recommendations that were compiled by the Dependability Task Team, the parties have agreed to consider modifying the Agreement to allow pilots to have greater control over their schedules. Since most of the following modifications
require considerable computer support in order to be administered reliably and some of the concepts are untried and intended to be experimental, this Letter of Agreement constitutes a mutual commitment to pursue development of the necessary processes and
computer support in order to initiate trials of the concepts listed below and then to implement each provision when the panics agree that appropriate computer support is in place. Once implemented, any or all of these provisions can be discontinued by
notice being given to the other party at least 90 days prior to the month in which the provision is to be discontinued.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>1. Unlimited Trip Trading with Open Flying</P>
</B><P>Automated trip trading with open flying will include the following concepts:</P>
<B><P>1-a- </B>The automated open flying trip trade system will use (1) a single monthly "run down", prior to the beginning of the subject month, during which trades will be awarded based on relative seniority and (2) an ongoing "first come, first
served" system; both similar to the current Shuttle system.</P>
<B><P>1-b- </B>No pilot will be permitted to drop a trip if it reduces the projected value of his line below fifty (50) credit hours, without Company concurrence.</P>
<B><P>1-c- </B>Rules for establishing blackout and embargo days will be published and</P>
<P>available to pilots. It is intended that these two identifiers will be applied and</P>
<P>removed on a dynamic basis as coverage circumstances change; as such, it is</P>
<P>important that each pilot be aware of the factors that may cause his trading/</P>
<P>dropping opportunities to change as time passes.</P>
<B><P>1-d- </B>New mutually agreed upon rules will be established and published to clearly define the opportunities regarding a trade that touches an embargo day or that departs on a blackout day. These rules will provide greater access than provided by
the current Trip Trade Letter (93-2).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Letter 9-1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 110</P>
<P>1-e- </B>Depending upon the size of the domicile, up to 3% of the credit time in any</P>
<P>equipment, status and domicile may be left as open time to facilitate trip trading</P>
<P>with open flying.</P>
<B><P>1-f- </B>A pilot will be permitted to trip trade with or pick up open flying which results</P>
<P>in his projection exceeding the applicable actual flight time limit by up to two (2)</P>
<P>hours, if the trade involves flying on a blackout or embargo day. Once a pilot</P>
<P>becomes projected above the normal monthly flight time limit as a result of this</P>
<P>provision, he will not be required to drop a trip or portion of a trip if he later</P>
<P>becomes further over projected for any reason, unless he becomes projected more than one hour above the projection he had just prior to the assignment that</P>
<P>produced the additional hour.</P>
<B><P>1-g- </B>A pilot may trip trade with another pilot as long as the resulting trade is legal under the provisions of Section 5.</P>
<B><P>2. Overprojection Protection</P>
</B><P>The provisions of Section 5-B-2-a, 5-B-3 and the related provisions of the</P>
<P>International Supplement shall be modified as follows:</P>
<B><P>2-a- </B>If a pilot initially becomes projected over the actual limit applicable to him under Section 5-B-2-a (and related provisions of the International Supplement) and such overprojection is entirely (1) the result of flying a carryover trip
from the prior month or (2) the result of his flying trips that did not project him to exceed the applicable limit at the time the assignment was made (including trips assigned under the provisions of Section Section 20-H or 20-I); then such pilot may, at
his discretion, fly the remainder of his schedule without being required to drop any flying in order to comply with the 5-B-2-a limits.</P>
<B><P>2-b- </B>A pilot may indicate his willingness to fly his complete schedule under this provision even if his projection should exceed the allowable actual monthly flight time due to month-end carry overs or operational increases in flight time. A
mainline pilot may make this election at any time including during the line award process, in which case any adjustment made necessary by an inbound carry-over conflict can be repaired up to 83 actual flight hours (85 actual hours for international
lines). A pilot may contact OPBCM via phone or computer during the operating month to rescind his willingness to further exceed his actual projection. The Company will then be required to make the appropriate adjustment to prevent the pilot's actual
projection from exceeding by more than one hour his actual projection at the time he contacted OPBCM.</P>
<B><P>2-c- </B>If a pilot initially acquired a high flight time projection under the provisions of "2-a." above, he shall not be required to drop a trip due to funkier overprojection, except under the conditions described in "1-f", above,</P>
<B><P>3. Make Up of Sick Leave</P>
</B><P>The provisions of Section 7-D of the International Supplement (voluntary makeup of sick leave) shall apply to all pilots, including Shuttle pilots as follows:.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Page 111 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter 9-1</P>
<P>3-a- </B>Such pilot shall be eligible to restore all or part of his accrued sick leave used for the illness absence on an actual hour for actual hour basis.</P>
<B><P>3-b- </B>Restoration of sick leave accrual shall be accomplished by picking up open time under the provisions of Section 20-H-5 of the Agreement.</P>
<B><P>3-c- </B>Pick up under this provision shall be limited to the month in which the</P>
<P>absence occurs.</P>
<B><P>4. Language Conflicts</P>
</B><P>It is understood that, should there be language within the Agreement that appeal to be in conflict with the provisions of this Letter, this Letter shall prevail. If this accurately reflects our understanding, please sign and return 2 copies for
our files.</P>

<P>Dear Michael,</P>
<P>As a result of the new requirement that some newly trained Captains on equipment that performs international flying be assigned only domestic flying before receiving additional international training, the parties have agreed to the following:</P>
<B><P>1. </B>Any pilot who is awaiting international training and/or who requires domestic flying due to the application of the "International Training Matrix" will be paid the value of his awarded line or the value of the flying he actually performs,
whichever is greater.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>In those domiciles where both international and domestic flying are available, a</P>
<P>pilot awaiting international training who is awarded a line with international flying in the line will be removed from those international trips and be available to be assigned to domestic flying on the days he was originally scheduled to fly. He will
be considered to be at the top of the FIFO list for this provision.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>In those domiciles where no or insufficient domestic flying is scheduled, a pilot</P>
<P>requiring domestic flying may, at his option, choose to be sent TDY, if TDY is</P>
<P>available at a domestic domicile. Such TDY assignments will be made in seniority order from those pilots who volunteer for TDY. Otherwise, these pilots will be eligible to be assigned individual domestic trip pairing originating from domestic
domiciles. Such assignments will be constructed by incorporating legal deadhead segments at the start and end of the pairings; however, these pairings are not subject to the provisions of Section 8-L-6. Pilots eligible for single trip domestic assignments
will be considered to be at the top of the FIFO list for this purpose.</P>
<P>If this accurately reflects our understanding, please sign and return 2 copies for our files.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT ON A PROTOCOL</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR A CONSULTATIVE PROCESS</P>
<P>FOR ALLOCATION OF FLYING ISSUES</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BACKGROUND</P>
</B><P>The 1963 Pilot Agreement was the first to contain the provision which subsequently caused more System Board disputes between the Company and ALPA than any other provision of the contract. The provision appears in Section 20, titled allocation,
assignment and scheduling of flying, and reads:</P>
<P>It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that this System Scheduling</P>
<P>Committee shall provide pilots with the opportunity to consult with and make</P>
<P>recommendations to the Company on the allocation of flying, assignment and</P>
<P>reduction of flying to pilot domiciles in accordance with the "equipment to seniority" concept:</P>
<P>"Equipment to seniority" shall mean that within the limits of flying hours available to a domicile by equipment type, the more senior pilots shall be given the opportunity to fly equipment in the following order:...</P>
<P>The System Board heard grievances submitted by ALPA alleging the Company was not complying with these provisions in 1967, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1984 and 1993. Each System Board decision, in addition to determining the contractual rights of the parties,
stands for the proposition that the Company and ALPA have had significant difficulty determining how to effectively implement ALPA's opportunity to consult with and make recommendations to the Company on the allocation of flying, assignment and reduction
of flying to pilot domiciles in accordance with the equipment to seniority concept.</P>
<P>Each System Board decision permitted the Company to make the final decision on allocation of flying issues. In these disputes, ALPA consistently maintained the Company failed to provide a meaningful opportunity to consult or that the Company failed to
comply with the equipment to seniority concept. In making decisions on allocating, assigning and scheduling of flying, the Company maintained that it could modify a literal application of seniority due to various factors, such as:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>HUMAN/CONTRACTUAL FACTORS</P>
<P>- </B>Relative seniority of the equipment domicile</P>
<B><P>- </B>Current equipment domicile size</P>
<B><P>- </B>Other equipment types at the domicile</P>
<B><P>- </B>Number of pilots with future bids</P>
<B><P>- </B>Domicile stability.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter 97-4</P>

<B><P>- </B>Administrative costs</P>
<P>Pursuant to the ESOP established in 1994, the parties adopted a Statement of</P>
<P>Principles which defined the basic ESOP expectations of the Company and ALPA. Two of those principles are:</P>
<B><P>It shall be our goal to encourage and embrace employee input into the decision making process in order to stimulate a feeling of personal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ownership.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and</P>
<P>We will recognize and respect the managerial and representational roles &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and responsibilities of each organization.</P>
</B><P>The parties have noted that the allocation of flying provision of the contract and these two Statements of Principle are remarkably consistent with each other. The parties also recognize their recent experience with the DC10 equipment domicile
closing demonstrates continuing difficulties with implementing the provisions of Section 20-A-2</P>
<P>Therefore, the parties desire to establish a protocol which recognizes, respects and implements both the Contract and the Statement of Principles regarding this most vital element of the Company - Pilot relationship, that is, the allocation of flying,
assignment and reduction of flying in accordance with the equipment to seniority concept.</P>
<P>To that end, the Company must recognize its responsibility to give ALPA the</P>
<P>opportunity to provide meaningful input to the allocation and assignment of flying</P>
<P>process and ALPA must be confident that it has been given a legitimate opportunity to be consulted and to make recommendations before Company decisions are made on allocation of flying issues. The parties believe that ALPA's seat on the Board of
Directors, its Officers' regularly scheduled monthly meetings with the CEO and President, and the SSC's participation in the Company's strategic planning process significantly enhance this level of confidence. Accordingly, the following protocol,</P>
<B><P>Letter 97-4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</B><P>which is intended to assist the Director of Flight Crew Resources and the System</P>
<P>Scheduling Committee, establishes the rights and obligations of each party whenever the Company must extend to ALPA the right to be consulted and to make recommendations on allocation and assignment of flying issues.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROTOCOL FOR CONSULTATIVE PROCESS</P>
<P>1. </B>The Parties agree that the following subject matters are within the concept of</P>
<P>allocation, assignment and scheduling of flying as described in Section 20 of the Pilot Agreement:</P>
<B><P>1-a- </B>opening new or closing existing domiciles,</P>
<B><P>1-b- </B>opening new equipment domiciles or closing equipment domiciles,</P>
<B><P>1-c- </B>changing the size of domiciles in accordance with standards to be agreed upon.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>When the need for a decision on an above referenced subject is identified, the Director of Flight Crew Resources (the Director) has the responsibility to give ALPA notice that it will be given the opportunity to be consulted and to make
recommendations prior to the time the Company makes its decision. The Director will give this notice by issuing to the System Scheduling Committee (SSC) a Notice of Proposed Decision Making (NPDM). The Director has a good faith responsibility to issue the
NPDM as soon as possible after the need arises to allow ALPA as much time as possible to respond.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>The NPDM shall contain:</P>
<B><P>3-a- </B>a statement of the issue the Company needs to decide,</P>
<B><P>3-b- </B>an estimate of the time frame within which the Company must make a</P>
<P>decision,</P>
<B><P>3-c- </B>specific information, if any, the Company may require from ALPA, and</P>
<B><P>3-d- </B>the date by which ALPA's recommendations are required to be submitted to the Director.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>The NPDM shall be delivered to the System Schedule Committee members by US Mail or by a more expeditious method, such as hand delivered or by FAX, except that it shall also be sent certified mail to the ALPA Master Chairman.</P>
<B><P>5. </B>The SSC will respond to the NPDM by certified mail as quickly as possible given the time frame within which a decision must be made. The response to the Director shall indicate the following:</P>
<B><P>5-a- </B>whether the SSC wishes to be consulted and given the opportunity to make a recommendation on the issue, and if it does, its initial impression about how and when it wants to address the issue, such as by conference call, at an immediate
meeting or at the next SSC meeting,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter 97-4</P>
<P>5-b- </B>any preliminary information it desires for its preparation and evaluation of the issue prior to discussions with the Company,</P>
<B><P>5-c- </B>an initial estimate of the time period the SSC believes will be required before it can make recommendations.</P>
<B><P>6. </B>The Director will provide all requested pertinent information in accordance with</P>
<P>Section 20-A-2-f of the Pilot Agreement. If the Director is unable to provide the</P>
<P>requested information, the Director will inform ALPA of the reasons therefore.</P>
<B><P>7. </B>When the parties discuss the issue, they will endeavor to identify the options</P>
<P>available to them at each stage of the decision making process and whether additional information or time is required to evaluate the options. The parties will consider, evaluate and apply the human, contractual and economic factors applicable to
allocation of flying issues as appropriate to each stage of the decision making process. When the SSC is satisfied that the parties have fully explored their reasonable options, the SSC will advise the Director when the SSC will be able to make its
recommendations to the Company. The SSC acknowledges that its recommendations must be submitted within the Company's time frame for decision.</P>
<B><P>8. </B>ALPA's internal protocol will identify the process by which the SSC will develop its recommendations before they are submitted to the Company.</P>
<B><P>9. </B>The SSC will submit its recommendation(s) in writing to the Director within the time limits specified in the NPDM, unless the parties have mutually agreed to a different deadline.</P>
<B><P>10. </B>If the SSC is unable to comply with the time limits, it may request additional time from the Director. The Director will advise the SSC whether additional time can be granted, and if not, the reasons therefore. If additional time cannot be
granted, the Director will advise the SSC when the decision will be made and when it will be announced.</P>
<B><P>11. </B>Before making his decision, the Director will consider and evaluate the</P>
<P>recommendations made by the SSC, if any, and will communicate in writing to the SSC the reasons for accepting or rejecting their recommendations.</P>
<B><P>12. </B>The SSC and the Director will provide feedback to each other on how well the</P>
<P>consultative process worked on each issue covered by a NPDM and the</P>
<P>improvements, if any, which they believe should be made to the process before the next NPDM is issued.</P>
<P>The parties agree this 24th day of February, 1997.</P>

<P>Dear Michael,</P>
<P>All B-777 aircraft serving international destinations will be re-equipped with the</P>
<P>"Genesis" first class seat system. On all B-777 international flights of twelve (12)</P>
<P>hours scheduled flight time or less, one such seat will be reserved as a dedicated pilot rest facility. Until the "Genesis" seat installation process is completed, however, ALPA and Company negotiating committees have agreed to the following changes
in the B-777 crew rest policy.</P>
<B><P>1. </B>Seat 1E is the exclusive crew rest seat on all B-777 aircraft, and Seat 1F is to be assigned or occupied only if it is the last available seat in the first class cabin.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>Both Seat 1E and Seat 1F shall be marked with appropriate seat coverings which identify the seats as reserved for crew rest. Additionally, a Customer Service Representative must advise the Captain of the status of Seat 1F at the time of

<P>Dear Michael,</P>
<P>As a result of changes made to the open flying pick-up procedures for line pilots by the "trip-trade with open flying" Letter of Agreement, the parties have agreed to add the following companion changes to the pick up process for flight-qualified</P>
<P>management:</P>
<P>Flight qualified managers may use the "zero trade" provision of the trip trade with</P>
<P>open flying process to pick up open flying, with the following limitations:</P>
<P>The availability of trips which are eligible for pick up by a manager will be limited to those trips that have been placed into open flying as a result of a line pilot having already performed a trade with open flying; except that a manager may pick
up any trip that has been listed in open flying and available for pick up for at least 6 hours, or after 12 noon, local domicile time, whichever is later.</P>

<P>Rosemont, IL 60018</P>
<P>Dear Mike:</P>
<P>The purpose of this letter is to inform you of how the Company will address some</P>
<P>specific issues relative to how contract training is conducted and to the use of revenue sharing simulators.</P>
<B><P>1. </B>Contract Training</P>
<P>There are seven key areas that need to be properly managed: instruction, programs, simulator maintenance, facilities, scheduling, customer service and sales an marketing. The responsibility of each of these areas falls on either Flight Operations, UAL
Services (Flight Training Services), or both as set forth below:</P>
<U><P>Instruction</U> is the responsibility of Flight Operations "Wet" contract training for aircraft types United operates will be accomplished by Pilot Instructors on the UAL Pilot Seniority List in accordance with the Pilot Instructor Letter of
Agreement (89-2) and under virtually identical working conditions.</P>
<P>Necessary training will be provided to Pilot Instructors when required to conduct non-UAL syllabus programs.</P>
<U><P>Program development</U> is the responsibility of Flight Operations with coordination</P>
<P>support provided by FTS.</P>
<U><P>Simulator maintenance</U> is the responsibility of Flight Operations.</P>
<U><P>Facilities</U> provision and maintenance is the responsibility of Flight Operations.</P>
<U><P>Scheduling</U> is the responsibility of Flight Operations. FTS has responsibility for</P>
<P>scheduling of contract customers and to demonstrate "operational control" in</P>
<P>accordance with FAR Part 142 certification.</P>
<U><P>Customer Service</U> is the primary responsibility of FTS, but is also the responsibility of all United personnel who support contract training. FTS must coordinate each customer's entire training experience including: travel, hotel, scheduling,
contracts, payment, and changes to training, while accommodating cultural differences and any other special circumstances that may arise.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter 9-1</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><U><P>Sales and marketing</U> is the responsibility of FTS. It is the responsibility of FTS to sell excess simulator and training capacity for United Airlines.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>Revenue Share Simulators/Flight Training Devices</P>
<P>The Company is very supportive of the revenue share concept to the extent that it improves our flexibility to provide United pilot training and can generate revenues and profits for United Airlines when excess training capacity is available or sale by
United. Therefore, we would like to see its successful implementation by the following:</P>
<B><P>2-a- </B>Revenue Share simulators and flight training devices will be configured to meet existing UAL standards and maintained to those standards.</P>
<B><P>2-b- </B>The contract agreement with the revenue share partner states, among other things, that United Airlines can purchase the device at any time from the</P>
<P>commencement of the contract and has first right to purchase if the partner elects to remove the simulator</P>
<B><P>2-c- </B>United Airlines will purchase a revenue share device when it can be justified in accordance with corporate capital budgeting processes.</P>
<B><P>2-d- </B>In the event that United's pilot training needs exceed existing United owned or leased simulator capacity, United's pilot group will be given first priority when planning training times in the revenue share simulators.</P>
<P>Recognizing that this is a new concept, the Company will maintain a collaborative</P>
<P>relationship with ALPA in further developing these opportunities.</P>

<P>The parties have agreed to the establishment of a voluntary Standards Captain Job Share program in which two pilots who hold a Captain bid on the same equipment, in the same domicile, will share the duties of a Standards Captain and a line pilot. ALPA
and the Company have jointly defined the procedures to administer this program as described in a letter to Captain Michael Glawe dated January 20, 1998. Additionally, the following provisions will apply to volunteers while participating in this program:</P>
<B><P>1. </B>During the months in which the pilot is functioning in his line assignment, he may volunteer to perform LCA duties if he so desires. There is no implied obligation. if the pilot does volunteer, he will be governed by the provisions of
Section 9.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>For the month in which he will be functioning as a line pilot, the Job Share Special Assignment (JS) pilot will participate in the preferencing and awarding process at his domicile in order to have a line and/or reserve assignment.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>ESOP contributions and the allocation of ESOP stock will be governed by the</P>
<P>appropriate ESOP documents.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>Month End Conflicts</P>
<B><P>4-a- </B>Pilots shall have the option to fly their inbound during the first days of special assignment at DENTK. The Company may request the pilot be removed from any portion of the inbound in order to be in position to begin his Standard Captain's
duties and he will be pay protected for the portion of the trip in the outbound month. All contractual rest provisions will be applied prior to the pilot beginning his Standard Captain's duties at DENTK.</P>
<B><P>4-b- </B>Pilots shall have the option to continue the DENTK duties of the JS pilot into the following month, the "line month". The Company may request the pilot be removed from any portion of his initial trip in the following month, if necessary,
in order to continue Standard Captain's duties and he will be pay protected for the portion of the trip in the following month. If, as a result of performing Standard Captain activities in the following month, "the line month", the pilot has less days off
than originally scheduled in his awarded line, these lost days will be restored to him in a following month in which he is assigned to DENTK or given to him as vacation credit days with his concurrence. All contractual rest provisions will be applied
prior to the pilot beginning his line and/or reserve assignment.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter 9-2</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>5. </B>Vacation</P>
<B><P>5-a- </B>Each volunteer pilot functioning as a Job Share Standards Captain will</P>
<P>maintain any annual vacation awarded to him for the 1998/99 vacation year. If the awarded vacation split is scheduled for a month in which the pilot is on special assignment as a Job Share Standards Captain to the Fleet at DENTK, the appropriate
vacation day adjustment described in the Letter to Captain Michael Glawe dated January 20, 1998, will be applied. Remaining unawarded vacation may be taken by the Job Share Standards Captain either while functioning on the line or DENTK depending on where
he is assigned for the particular month. This monthly vacation will be awarded under Section 11-E of the Pilot Agreement or UAL Series 15 policy as appropriate. The above procedures will apply prospectively to any pilot who enters the Standards Captains
Job Share program after the awarding of the annual vacation.</P>
<B><P>5-b- </B>Beginning with the next full vacation year (1999/2000), volunteer pilots on special assignment functioning as Job Share Standards Captains, will have half of their accrued vacation allocated to be taken while flying their line assignment
and the remaining half adjusted, per the Letter to Captain Glawe dated January 20, 1998, to be taken while performing as a Job Share Standards Captain at DENTK. The appropriate previsions of Section 11 of the Pilot Agreement will apply for the bidding and
awarding of annual and monthly vacation while the pilot is flying his line assignment at the domicile and UAL. Series 15 policy will apply to the bidding and awarding of both annual and monthly vacation while the pilot is on special assignment as a
volunteer Standards Captain at DENTK.</P>

<P>Re: Standards Captain Job Share Special Assignment Agreement</P>
<P>Dear Mike:</P>
<P>This letter will confirm our agreement that during any period when a pilot is in fact</P>
<P>functioning for United as a Standards Captain under the terms of Letter of Agreement 9-2, he is, insofar as pay, working conditions, performance of his actual job duties and the responsibilities relating thereto, a management employee. Accordingly,
ALPA shall have no representational rights or obligations to any such pilot with respect to any issue relating to that pilot's employment as a Standards Captain. ALPA will continue, of course, to represent any such pilot as to other matters governed by
the terms of the Agreement and for all purposes during those periods when the pilot is functioning as a line pilot.</P>

<P>Dear Michael,</P>
<P>As it is not the intent of the Company or the Association to limit a pilot to one domicile trade in his probationary year, the parties agree that this letter shall amend and replace Letter of Agreement 91-22.</P>
<P>Effective February I, 1998, any pilot in his probationary year, while occupying the</P>
<P>assignment which he received upon initial employment as a pilot, shall be eligible to enter into voluntary domicile trades, as follows:</P>
<B><P>1. </B>Any pilot desiring to change domiciles under this provision must locate another</P>
<P>eligible pilot at the desired domicile with whom to trade. To be eligible to enter into a domicile trade, both pilots must hold assignments in the same status and equipment that they were initially trained for at DENTK as described above.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>Both pilots involved must approve the trade. All pilots on the Pilot Eligibility</P>
<P>Seniority List whose seniority falls between these two pilots have thirty (30) days from posting of the notice to object to such trade. The Association will collect and maintain the necessary records of approvals.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>Upon written notification to the Company by the Association that a trade has been agreed upon, without objection as provided under 2 above, the mutual transfer will be made effective on the first day of the next month for which schedules
have not been posted for preferencing.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>Pilots who make domicile changes under this provision will not receive Company paid moves nor be covered by any of the other provisions of Section 10. Such pilots will also accomplish necessary travel on their own time and will not receive
Company paid time off for "travel days".</P>
<B><P>5. </B>Bidding restrictions ("freezes") already in place will be unaffected by a domicile</P>
<P>trade. A trade will not generate a new freeze nor add to an existing one.</P>
<B><P>6. </B>Any awarded vacation will be unaffected by a domicile trade.</P>
<B><P>7. </B>There will not be a limit on the number of domicile trades, as long as the pilots</P>
<P>involved meet all of the requirements of this Letter. If this accurately reflects our</P>
<P>understanding, please sign and return 2 copies for our files.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><P>The attached Scheduling Protocol document has been developed in a cooperative spirit by representatives of ALPA, Flight Operations, and UAL Services (Flight Training Services). The purpose of this document is to provide a protocol to all trainees
(United Airlines and Contract), instructors (United Airlines and Contract), management employees, and customers as to the use and prioritization of assets at the Flight Center.</P>
<P>It is the intent of all responsible parties to provide a quality training environment for all trainees who come to the Flight Center. To that end, the Scheduling Protocol document contains language which addresses the scheduling of simulators (and
other flight training devices), classrooms, and instructors. The document also addresses the use of Revenue Sharing simulators, sale of guarantee simulator times, and prioritization of assets during operational changes.</P>
<P>This document is intended to be a living document which will be reviewed and</P>
<P>modified by mutual agreement to reflect the needs of all trainees who come to the Flight Center. By signing this document each party gives their support to abide by and support the implementation of the scheduling protocols.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 2: Sale of Guaranteed Simulator Time</P>
<P>1. </B>FTS may guarantee Surplus Capacity simulator time on a day specific basis, with exceptions only to be approved by the Fleet Captain, with the following restrictions:</P>
<B><P>1-a- </B>Based upon the latest Training Plan supplied by WHQ, historical data,</P>
<P>DENTK Scheduling, Fleet planning, arid Simulator Services, the Fleet Captain will determine the total amount of Surplus Capacity in his Fleet. The Fleet Captain, with input from FTS, will determine the amount of simulator time, in that Fleet, that can
be sold as Guaranteed Simulator Time.</P>
<B><P>1-b- </B>In a Fleet with a Revenue Sharing Simulator, the Fleet Captain and FTS, in a collaborative fashion, will determine the amount of simulator time that can be sold as Guaranteed Simulator Time.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>Guaranteed Simulator time can be sold no further out than 90 days from the</P>
<P>Operational Day, with the exception to be approved by the Fleet Captain and the MRI Team.</P>
<B><P>3. AFTER </B>UAL scheduling needs in a particular Fleet are met, FTS can schedule</P>
<P>Guaranteed Simulator Time for a specific time of day after approximately the 1st of the month prior to the Operational Month. For example: the 1st of March for the Operational Month of April.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>In <B>NO </B>case will the sale of Guaranteed Simulator Time generate the need for UAL pilots in training to go Off Campus for flight training.</P>
<B><P>5. </B>In <B>NO </B>case will the sale of Guaranteed Simulator Time impact the ability for</P>
<P>Simulator Services to be able to perform routine and non- routing Simulator</P>
<P>Maintenance.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 3: Revenue Sharing Simulator Access &amp; Scheduling</P>
<P>1. <I><U>TRIGGER </I>1</B></U>: The Revenue Sharing Simulators will be utilized when Overflow</P>
<P>Training, in a given Fleet, is projected during an Operational Month. UAI Flight</P>
<P>Operations will have first priority in scheduling this Overflow Training into the</P>
<P>Revenue Sharing Simulator.</P>
<B><P>2. <I><U>TRIGGER </I>2</B></U>: During the Long-range Planning and Scheduling Phase, if UAL Flight Operations needs are projected to use 25% or more of the 24:00 to 02:00 time slot in an Operational Month in a given Fleet, those incremental UAL
crews will then be scheduled into the Revenue Sharing Simulator. Every effort will he made to sell enough simulator time to make this a cost neutral transaction.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>During the Daily Planning and Scheduling Phase, if a Scheduling Disruption occurs, the Revenue Sharing Simulators should be used to accommodate crews according to Chapter 5: Daily Planning and Scheduling Phase of this Protocol</P>
<B><P>4. </B>In NO case will the sale of Revenue Sharing Simulator Time by FTS, generate the need for UAL pilots in training to go Off Campus for flight training.</P>

<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 4: Long-range Planning and Scheduling Phase</P>
</B><P>The purpose of accurate planning is to ensure that United Airlines personnel are given first choice to meet their training and maintenance requirements in accordance with the C.B.A. The Long-range Planning Phase has many key events which require
coordination between the Fleets, Simulator Services, Scheduling, and Flight Training Services.</P>
<B><P>1. </B>Priority of scheduling resources (Simulators, flight training devices, classrooms, Learning Center, etc.) for training and Simulator maintenance will be given to all UAL Flight Operations requirements. Classes will be built for all known UAL
training requirements including:</P>
<B><P>1-a- </B>Proficiency Checks</P>
<B><P>1-b- </B>Initial, Transition, Upgrade, Requalification courses, and other Specialty</P>

<B><P>2. </B>Simulator maintenance will be scheduled in a manner which best accommodates the needs of the Fleet and Simulator Services, as determined by the Fleet Captain. This need can also include FTS. For example: in order to sell a particular FTS
Contract, a simulator might require a modification or update.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>Adequate Reserve Buffers (for UAL Flight Operations, Wet and Dry Contract</P>
<P>Training) will be established to provide reasonable unplanned capacity to</P>
<P>accommodate schedule disruptions which occur after the Long-range Planning Phase, including the following parameters:</P>

<P>7. NO </B>Reserve "M" Buffer will be sold by FTS without Fleet Captain and Simulator Services approval, and then only on a "non-guaranteed" basis.</P>

<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 5: Daily Planning and Scheduling Phase</P>
</B><P>The purpose of Daily Planning and Scheduling is to administer the Long-range Plan and make adjustments as necessary to minimize disruptions and establish a priority system when disruptions occur.</P>
<B><P>1. </B>Reserve Buffers will be allocated on a priority basis, as needed. The scheduling for UAL pilots in training for the most desirable time will be as provided in the C.B.A. Section 9-G-9.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>NO Reserve Buffer time will be sold by FTS without Fleet Captain approval, and then only on a "non-guaranteed" basis.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>NO Reserve "M" Buffer will be sold by FTS without Fleet Captain and Simulator Services approval, and then only on a "nonguaranteed" basis.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>Once ANY actual Simulator/FBS training session has started (not including the</P>
<P>briefing), the training session shall not be canceled and/or delayed substantially</P>
<P>without permission from the Instructor involved unless the Fleet Captain, with</P>
<P>appropriate coordination, authorizes the interruption (the session will still have to end at its regular scheduled time period, as per priority 7 below).</P>
<B><P>5. </B>In the event that a UAL crew's training period is disrupted and in the judgment of the Instructor involved that training is negatively impacted, then the training event will be rescheduled in its entirety and the period that was disrupted
will not count toward the completion of that course.</P>
<B><P>6. </B>If the Reserve "M" Buffer is needed in the Daily Planning and Scheduling Phase, and Simulator Services approval is given, the following priority will be adhered to:</P>
<B><P>6-a- </B>All priority will be given to moving Dry Contract Training in that time slot.</P>
<B><P>6-b- </B>If no Dry Contract Training can be moved into the Reserve "M" Buffer, and extra simulator time is still needed, FTS will attempt to delay the Wet Contract Class to the next possible slot, probably the next day.</P>
<B><P>6-c- </B>If no other alternatives are viable, Wet Contract Training can be moved into the Reserve "M" Buffer, with Instructor and Crew concurrence. The rest and duty requirements for the Pl's associated with these assignments are addressed
separately by the Company and ALPA in the Pl Guidelines.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>7. </B>For the Operational Day during a disruption with no sufficient Reserve Buffers</P>
<P>available, the following priority list indicates the highest to the lowest priority. Events A, B, C, and D are expected to complete their full scheduled event, all other events should reduce their Simulator time to get back on schedule. When a
training event needs to be canceled or moved, the priority list will be applied in reverse order:</P>
<B><P>7-a- </B>Any UAL Operational Currency event (i.e. Landing Currency)</P>
<B><P>7-b- </B>UAL PC's &amp; CQP Day 1, 2, &amp; 3 (Annual Training Events)</P>
<B><P>7-c- </B>UAL and FTS (Wet or Dry) Transition course check rides, LOE's, and</P>
<P>Validations</P>
<B><P>7-d- </B>UAL Transition training periods within two periods of a Check or LOE, and within one period of a Validation event</P>
<B><P>7-e- </B>Any UAL Scheduled Training</P>
<B><P>7-f- </B>Fleet Projects, as determined by the Fleet Captain</P>
<B><P>7-g- </B>Any Guaranteed FTS Scheduled Events</P>
<B><P>7-h- </B>Any nonguaranteed FTS previously Scheduled Events</P>
<B><P>7-i- </B>FTS Events (i.e. sold Reserve Buffer time)</P>
<B><P>7-j- </B>All other events</P>
<B><P>8. </B>If a UAL and FTS event fall within the same priority category, UAL events will take priority over FTS events.</P>
<B><P>9. </B>The Daily Scheduler must manage the schedule disruptions so as to minimize the effects of that disruption on as few crews as is possible. In the event of a mechanical disruption and/or a Simulator period running over its normally scheduled
time, the next scheduled period will normally absorb the overage, as determined by the priority list above, unless the Daily Scheduler, in conjunction with the Fleet Captain, and if possible, the involved Instructors, determines an alternative plan would
be more advantageous.</P>

6: General</P>
<P>1. </B>Because of the unique nature of the Simulator Scheduling Protocol, the MRI Team will on a monthly basis review, monitor, report, and if necessary, make</P>
<P>recommendations and changes in the following areas:</P>
<B><P>1-a- </B>The sale of Guaranteed Simulator Time.</P>
<B><P>1-b- </B>The use of the Revenue Sharing Simulators. A periodic study will be</P>
<P>performed on the entire Revenue Sharing Simulator concept, including the</P>
<P>potential purchase.</P>
<B><P>1-c- </B>The concept of Reserve Buffers, utilizing such measures as:</P>
<B><P>1-c-1- </B>All Planned versus Actually used Reserve Buffer time slots in the</P>
<P>previous month.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1-c-2- </B>What kind of activity was scheduled and who used the Reserve Buffers</P>
<B><P>1-d- </B>A Simulator (or FBS) usage report of the Reserve "M" Buffers. A study will be performed anytime the usage of the Reserve "M" Buffer exceeds 5% per month in a given fleet. The report of this study will include the following:</P>
<B><P>1-d-1- </B>Reasons for the high Reserve "M" Buffer usage</P>
<B><P>1-d-2- </B>If this is just an anomaly or whether this is an upward trend</P>

<B><P>1-e- </B>Long-range and Daily Planning and Scheduling Phase.</P>
<B><P>1-f- </B>Other relevant facts, as determined by the MRI Team.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>In either case, approximately 6 months after the start of the full implementation of the Simulator Scheduling Protocol, all appropriate parties involved will perform a thorough review and publish a report.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>In case of a dispute over access to any UAL Simulator or Device, the Fleet Captain will make the final determination.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>In case of dispute over access to a Revenue Sharing Simulator, the Fleet Captain and FTS, in a collaborative fashion, will make the final determination. In the event no satisfactory resolution can be reached in a timely fashion, the Fleet
Captain will make the final determination.</P>
<B><P>5. </B>In keeping with the spirit of cooperation between the Company and ALPA, all</P>
<P>current and future matters regarding the DENTK Simulator Scheduling Protocol topic will be resolved in a collaborative fashion.</P>

<P>6400 Shafer Court, Suite 700</P>
<P>Rosemont, IL 60018</P>
<P>Dear Mike:</P>
<P>The Company has indicated a desire to introduce the B777 model aircraft into the Pacific operation. This strategy will likely prevent market fragmentation and sustain the efficient operation of current routes that no longer support the use of the
B747- 400. Additionally, the introduction of the B777-B model aircraft on such routes will provide long-term growth opportunities including increased B747-400 operations into the Pacific. Therefore, to facilitate the Company's operation of Pacific ETOPS
flight segments with B777 model aircraft, the parties have agreed to install an ALPA approved rest facility as follows:</P>
<B><P>1. </B>The Company will equip all current and future B777-B model aircraft with a crew bunk facility similar to the B747-400 aircraft. Until the crew bunk facility is installed on B777-B model aircraft, the Genesis seat will serve as the pilot crew
rest facility. The Company will retrofit all current B777-B model aircraft with a crew bunk according to the agreed upon schedule, provided all of the variables pertaining to the retrofit occur as planned.</P>
<B><P>2. </B>The Company will retrofit all three class B777-B and B777-A model aircraft with a Genesis seat. The Company will complete the installation of Genesis seats on all B777-B and B777-A model aircraft according to the agreed upon schedules,
provided all of the variables pertaining to this retrofit occur as planned. The Company, however, is not obligated to equip B777 model aircraft dedicated to the domestic operation with crew bunks or Genesis seats and these aircraft will not be scheduled
nor substituted into the international operation.</P>
<B><P>3. </B>A joint committee comprised of Company and ALPA representatives will monitor the development and installation of the crew bunk facility and the Genesis seat to ensure compliance with this agreement.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>Prior to the installation of the crew bunks on the B777-B model aircraft, the</P>
<P>Company may only schedule Pacific ETOPS flight segments with aircraft equipped with the Genesis seat. The Company may, however, substitute a B777 model aircraft equipped without Genesis seats to avoid a cancellation. This substitution provision will
remain in effect until March 1, 2000, or until 12 B777 model aircraft are equipped with the Genesis seat, whichever occurs first. Additionally, the Company will provide the Association with documentation indicating the flight segments on which any.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

</B><P>substitution was necessary and the reasons for the substitution. Completion of the installation of crew bunks and Genesis seats as set forth above resolves the crew rest issue on the B777 model aircraft utilized in the international operation and,
thereafter, the Company may continue to operate such aircraft in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</P>
<B><P>5. </B>The Company will not operate augmented B767 flying in the Pacific until such</P>
<P>aircraft are fitted with an ALPA approved crew rest facility.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">W I T N E S S E T H:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">It is hereby mutually agreed:</P>
<B><P>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The current Honolulu domicile established during the term of the 1991 Agreement will be limited to the B-747 except that short range equipment such as the B-737 and/or B-727 may also be introduced for inter-island service
only. Such inter-island equipment domicile may be established as either a permanent or TDY domicile. The Company will consult with the Association prior to establishing such inter-island Honolulu domicile. Additionally, the Company agrees to use Letter of
Agreement 97-4 (Allocation of Flying Protocol) prior to the introduction of any other equipment in the Honolulu domicile.</P>
<B><P>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>As long as the B-747 flying supporting the Honolulu domicile is sufficient to</P>
<P>maintain a minimum line level, the domicile will remain open. As the system-wide B-747 flying is reduced due to the phasing out of the equipment, the reduction will be accomplished under the provisions of Section 8 of the Agreement. The Company and
the SSC shall monitor the B-747 flying on a monthly basis to assure compliance with this provision.</P>

<P>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In construction of DSL pairings for the Honolulu B-747 equipment domicile, the Company will observe the scheduling philosophies required by Letter 91-7</P>
<P>(Scheduling Practices Letter). All Section 20 scheduling dispute resolution procedures will be available to address any problems associated with these parings, up to and including a review by the Senior Vice-President, Flight Operations.</P>
<B><P>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A paid move from the Hawaiian Islands to any point in the contiguous 48 states will be available to any pilot who (1) retires (including early or medical retirement) while based in Honolulu and (2) who has an established
residence in Hawaii. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10-C-3 of the Agreement, this move entitlement shall apply only to a move from the Hawaiian Islands to the Mainland.</P>
<B><P>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Bid but unfilled vacancies in Honolulu shall not be subject to involuntary</P>
<P>assignment under the provisions of Section 8-F of the Agreement, except the</P>

<P>Dear Captain Glawe:</P>
<P>The Association and the Company have jointly agreed to review the staffing and the currency requirements for augmented flying. This review has been separated into two distinct parts. One discusses temporary modifications to address currency
requirements. The other studies various methods of staffing augmented flights. The following procedures will apply until the staffing study is completed:</P>
<P>The B747-400 crews will, in addition to the PC/CQP, be scheduled for a PT as follows:</P>
<P>The PT will be scheduled in the same manner as a PC/CQP, using a base six (6)</P>
<P>months from the PC/CQP base month. The PT will comply with the PC/CQP scheduling rules of the Agreement. Travel to and from a PT will be the same as the PC/CQP.</P>
<P>In addition to the present landing currency requirements, all B747-400 first officers will be required to accomplish one (1) landing and take off in the aircraft within 180 consecutive days.</P>
<P>A new training opportunity will be implemented, an Operating Experience Refresher ("OER"). The OER will consist of at least two (2) segments in the aircraft. A minimum of one (1) segment will be flown with the pilot receiving the OER as the pilot
flying ("PF"). A check airman will conduct the OER. The check airman may extend the OER beyond the minimum two (2) legs if</P>
<P>necessary. The Company may assign an OER to a pilot during his last 30 calendar days of availability prior to the expiration of the 180-day landing/takeoff currency limit. During any time other than this last 30 calendar day period, the Company may
assign an OER only with pilot concurrence.</P>
<B><P>Page 418 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter 99-6</P>
</B><P>Lineholders who are subject to an OER as described in the above paragraph may be assigned up to the actual domestic limits of FAR 121.471. With pilot concurrence, The OER may be scheduled on days off in conjunction with</P>
<P>vacation. If the pilot refuses an OER on his vacation days off, any flying lost due to not qualified status ("NQ") will be pay protected to the 78-hour guarantee.</P>
<P>A first officer requiring an OER may be assigned an open flying ID or displace a</P>
<P>first officer in a flying ID.</P>
<P>Letter 91-28 will apply to OER's for reserve pilots in the same manner as IOE's.</P>
<P>Over-projection protection contained within Letter of Agreement 9-1 will apply to OER assignments. Consistent with 3-B-4-c-2, the pilot will be paid his line value or his line value after the OER modification, whichever is greater.</P>
<P>The following modifications will be implemented for the B747-400 schedules.</P>
<P>Commencing with the March 1999 schedule, lines of flying will be constructed to</P>
<P>include a combination of flying and non-flying ID's when possible. Specifically, one (1) flying ID will be traded for a non-flying ID provided it has the same schedule legs and pay value. First officer ID's with all domestic flying may be
redistributed to relief pilot lines' whenever possible.</P>
<P>First officers who have repeated two (2) training/checking events within twenty-four (24) months, or first officers with less than 75 hours in the aircraft, will not be</P>
<P>permitted to bid a line or be assigned an ID with a captain who has repeated two</P>
<P>(2) training/checking events within twenty-four (24) months or a captain with less</P>
<P>than 75 hours in the aircraft. If a first officer is paired with a captain who has not fulfilled the initial requirement of ten (10) landings, OPBCM may provide other flying that would maintain the first officer's landing currency. This modification
will require the first officer's concurrence. If the replacement flying is of a lesser value, the first officer will be pay protected for the greater. With his concurrence, a flight officer that could lapse landing currency may be removed from an ID and
assigned other flying to maintain his currency. If the replacement flying is of a lesser value, the flight officer will be pay protected for the greater.</P>
<B><P>Letter 99-6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</B><P>Pilots will be prohibited from trading out of a flying ID when they have exceeded</P>
<P>120 days without an actual landing and take off in the aircraft by freezing the ID.</P>
<P>Once a pilot has been assigned an OER, all flying ID's will no longer be frozen.</P>
<P>OPBCM may effect the trade, providing the pilot is attempting to trade into another flying ID and allowing the trade will not negatively influence the outcome of the pilot's currency.</P>
<P>The following flight assignment restrictions will apply to the B747-400: A first officer who is not landing/take off current (180 day currency) in the aircraft</P>
<P>can only be given an OER assignment to regain currency. OPBCM may alter FIFO order to make a flying ID assignment to a captain or first officer who is within 30 days of lapsing currency. The parties encourage pilots to assist in maintaining currency
requirements by exchanging roles within an ID whenever possible.</P>
<P>A "Safety Awareness" program will be scheduled and all pilots will be required to</P>
<P>attend a presentation of this program or revert to NQ, non-pay status. This program will be approximately one (1) hour long. The pilot will receive one (1) hour of pay for attending in addition to all other pay for the month. A schedule will be posted
of the viewing times available at each domicile and DENTK for the entire presentation period. A pilot may view the Safety Awareness program at any location.</P>
<P>The provisions contained within this Letter will initially apply to the B747-400 fleet but may be expanded to other augmented fleets. The parties agree to monitor the results of the above provisions and will immediately meet to address any necessary
modifications. The provisions of this Letter will remain in effect until the completion and implementation of the Augmentation Study or December 1, 1999, whichever occurs first, unless both parties agree to an extension.</P>
<P>This Letter of understanding reflects the changes necessary to comply with the FAA requirements in place for the time period required to complete the Augmentation Study. Provisions contained within this Letter are non-precedent setting and will not be
cited by either party in any manner.</P>

<P>Dear Captain Glawe:</P>
<P>On March 29, 1999, we discussed our previously unwritten agreement of not</P>
<P>assigning new-hire pilots for their initial assignment to wide-body First Officer</P>
<P>positions in an international operation. Flight Operations agrees this is a wise</P>
<P>approach in helping maintain the highest safety standards in our international</P>
<P>operation.</P>
<P>To this end, I am reaffirming my direction to Flight Crew Resources and to the Denver Flight Center to continue this policy and ensure that all new-hire pilots receiving their initial assignment not be assigned to any wide-body First Officer position
in an international operation. If this accurately reflects our discussion and our agreement, please sign and return two (2) copies to me for our files.</P>

<P>Dear Mike,</P>
<P>This letter is to inform you of a change to the Job Share Standards Captain</P>
<P>guidelines. Based on the recommendations of a team studying the issue, effective July 1, 1999, the Company will alter the manner in which it pays Job Share Standards Captains. The following provision will replace the pay paragraph in the original
letter of January 20, 1999, as well as the addendum dated March 19, 1999:</P>
<B><P>PAY</B>. During a month in which the pilot is assigned to DENTK, the Company will</P>
<P>pay the pilot at the individual's current rate for the greater of 81 hours or the</P>
<P>individual's awarded line value. In addition to this monthly rate, the Company will pay the pilot $100 for each day the individual performs Standards Captain duties at DENTK.</P>
<P>Please advise if the Association has any questions regarding this process change.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS the Company has advised the Association that in response to these developments it is considering a proposed transaction (the "Transaction") in which a limited partnership formed pursuant to a partnership agreement
(the ''Partnership Agreement'') between the Company and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, a corporation organized under the laws of Germany ("L") with L as a general partner (the "Joint Venture"), would purchase preferred stock of Air Canada, Inc. ("C"), that is
convertible into nonvoting common stock of C (the "Preferred Stock''), and.</P>

</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Partnership Agreement provides that the purposes of the Joint Venture are to acquire, hold, convert and exchange the Preferred Stock and securities issuable upon conversion thereof and to engage in
certain activities related thereto;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company has further advised the Association that (1) according to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the Company would have a 40 percent interest in the Joint Venture, which itself would conduct no
flight operations of any sort whatsoever; (2) as it relates to the issue of whether the Joint Venture is an ''Affiliate'', in the Partnership Agreement the Company would expressly disavow the right or power to conduct those activities that are set forth
in the pilot collective bargaining agreement (the ''Agreement'') as constituting ''Control''; (3) as part of the Transaction, the Company would also acquire interests as a lessor or equity holder in an aircraft sale-leaseback and as the provider of a
guarantee of certain indebtedness of C; however, the sale/leaseback lease will contain a provision which prohibits C from using such aircraft to provide or receive passenger feed from the Company pursuant to an agreement or an arrangement with the Company
or an Affiliate other than an</P>
<P>industry standard interline agreement; and (4) the Transaction may provide that each investor in the Joint Venture will have the right at any time after December 31, 2001 to require the Joint Venture to (i) make a distribution to such investor of
Preferred Stock or (ii) sell Preferred Stock on behalf of such investor and to distribute the proceeds from such sale to such investor, subject to certain limitations, but in such event the Company will agree in such Transaction to exercise the right
under clause (i), above, only with the consent of the Association or if such exercise is no longer prohibited by the Agreement, and</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, while the Association believes that the potential Transaction could violate Section 1-B and related sections of the Agreement, the Company has advised the Association that it believes that the proposed
Transaction would not violate the Agreement and is not seeking the Association's approval, and</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS the Association has determined, in light of the strategic importance of the Canadian aviation relationship, that it does not wish to object at this time to the Transaction as it presently understands the Company's
plans, and</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS the Company has advised the Association that it is developing plans for additional Company flying to the Canadian market and will brief the Association on such plans no later than the regularly scheduled January
2000 UAL-MEC meeting, and</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and the Association hereby agree as follows:</P>
<B><P>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Reservation of Rights. The Association hereby advises the Company that it does not intend to object to the proposed Transaction at this time based on its present understanding of the Transaction. Nonetheless, the
Association reserves the right to object to the Transaction in the future under Section 1-B or any other relevant provision of the Agreement. Nothing in this letter shall constitute or be construed as an endorsement or approval of the Transaction by the
Association.</P>
<B><P>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Tolling Agreement and Time Limits. A grievance under Section 1-J of the</P>
<P>Agreement objecting to the Transaction will be considered timely if filed by the</P>
<P>Association within one year following the date of the initial public announcement of the Transaction (the "Public Announcement''). Commencing six months following the Public Announcement, if the Association becomes aware of material facts regarding
the Transaction (i) that were not previously known by it and (ii) of which it could not reasonably have had knowledge, a grievance under Section 1-J of the Agreement objecting to the Transaction based on these material facts will be timely if filed by the
Association within the contractual time limits established in Section 17 of the Agreement.</P>
<B><P>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Non-prejudice. Except as limited by Paragraph 2, above, neither this Letter of Agreement, nor any decision by the Association not to object to the Transaction, will act in any way to prejudice the right of the Association
to object to the Transaction or to any other future action by the Company with respect to investment in aviation. The Association agrees that neither this Letter of Agreement nor the Company's decision to pursue the Transaction as described, to pursue it
in another form, or to withdraw from pursuing it, will act in any way to prejudice the Company's rights with respect to this or other such transactions.</P>
<B><P>4. </B>Duration. This Letter of Agreement will take effect upon its execution by the parties and will remain in effect concurrent with the Agreement.</P>
<B><P>Letter 99-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>Dear Captain Glawe:</P>
<P>The parties agree to modify the November 10, 1999 letter regarding the treatment of meal expenses incurred by pilots in line operations as follows:</P>
<B><P>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If an on board crew meal is unavailable, reimbursement of reasonable actual</P>
<P>expenses associated with obtaining a meal will be paid to the pilot upon submission of a company expense form and receipt.</P>
<B><P>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If the unavailable crew meal was ALPA requested, the reimbursement will be offset by the meal cost specified in Section 4-A-2 of the Agreement, which will be charged to the pilot. If the pilot obtains no meal, or requests
no reimbursement, the meal cost specified in Section 4-A-2 will not be charged to the pilot.</P>
<B><P>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A meal is "unavailable" if it is not on board the aircraft, incomplete, or spoiled.</P>
<B><P>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>"Unavailable" does not include meals that meet the SPCMEL request but are</P>
<P>deemed not appetizing or tasty.</P>

<P>Dear Mike,</P>
<P>As a result of discussions between the ALPA and Company Negotiating Committees, the parties have agreed to make the following adjustments to the Pilot Instructor Letter of Agreement (89-2):</P>
<B><P>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Modify Paragraph 5 of Letter of Agreement 89-2 to read as follows:</P>
<P>"The rate of pay for a pilot who is permanently assigned as a Pilot Instructor shall be not less than the 81 hour salary for the line assignment which he holds plus 15%. However, the monthly Pilot Instructor rate of pay shall not exceed the 85 hour
salary for a B747-400 First Officer at the sixth year longevity plus 7%."</P>
<B><P>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Modify Paragraph 6 of Letter 89-2 to read as follows: "Pilot Instructor schedules shall have a minimum of twelve (12) calendar days free of duty per month. For trainee/instructor continuity, Pilot Instructors shall be
allowed, at</P>
<P>their option, to trade their days off. Additionally, Pilot Instructor's may volunteer to</P>
<P>work up to two (2) additional days per month. The Pilot Instructor will make his</P>
<P>willingness to volunteer known prior to the closing date for instructor "days off"</P>
<P>requests. Pilot Instructors will be selected in seniority order within each fleet to work additional days. The pay for the additional days of work will be over and above all other monthly compensation (not limited to the monthly cap) and will be
calculated by dividing the Pilot Instructor's monthly salary by eighteen (18) to determine the daily value."</P>
<B><P>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The modifications of Letter of Agreement 89-2 in paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall take effect on November 1, 1999, and shall remain in effect for a period of twelve (12) months. During this twelve month period, a committee of
management and ALPA representatives will jointly develop a comprehensive proposal setting forth a plan for the permanent restructuring of the instructor workforce at DENTK with a time line for implementation. If the parties are successful in developing a
restructuring plan, the twelve (12) month period referenced above may be extended for up to an additional six (6) months to complete the transition of instructors at DENTK.</P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P>The following policy will apply to pilots who are unable to report to work due to a</P>
<P>"natural disaster", i.e., weather or other event as determined by the Chief Pilot or</P>
<P>Flight Manager.</P>
<B><P>- </B>Pilots will be placed on a "without pay" (ANP) status for the pairing(s) missed, according to the normal UAL "no work, no pay" policy.</P>
<B><P>- </B>Pilots holding a line and placed on "without pay" status may make up lost</P>
<P>credit time through the trip trade system or requesting to be placed on the 20-H-3 list for assignment to open time.</P>
<B><P>- </B>For reserve pilots, Chief Pilots or Flight Managers may, with the concurrence of the pilot, move remaining RDO's to cover the absence.</P>
<B><P>- </B>If there is insufficient time remaining in the month to make up lost credit time or if the pilot so chooses, the pilot may request that his/her Chief Pilot or Flight Manager restore pay up to the original value of the pilot's line from any
unassigned future or current vacation due to the pilot, without splitting any covered pairings. Note that using future or current vacation to cover the missed pairing(s) may result in reducing the number of "splits" available to the pilot in that vacation
year. In the event the "natural disaster" prevents a significant number of United employees from reporting to work, the COO will determine whether that time will be treated as paid time off.</P>

<B><P>- </B>lineholders will be assigned on a day off and will receive (1) training credit day as compensation;</P>
<B><P>- </B>reserves will be assigned on a reserve day of availability and his allowable monthly flight time will be reduced by four hours and twenty minutes (4:20) for the day missed as shown in his assigned reserve line. This compensation will be

<P>During discussions between ALPA and the Company, the parties have agreed that the following is full and final resolution to the 2000-2001 annual vacation award issue:</P>
<P>The company will re-award the 2000-2001 Annual vacations for pilots domiciled in Anchorage. Those affected Anchorage pilots will be given the option of retaining their original award or accepting the new award. For all other domiciles, the award of
the minimum vacation allocation for the 2000 - 2001 annual vacation process will be examined to determine the number of vacation days that were bid but unassigned. In the months where the 2000 - 2001 annual vacation days were bid but unassigned, the
company will allocate a minimum of those bid but unassigned annual vacation days in the respective 60-day monthly vacation</P>
<P>process.</P>
<P>The minimum monthly allocation will be awarded in each status for all future annual vacation preferencing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS LETTER OF AGREEMENT is made and entered into in accordance with the provisions of Title II of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, by and between UNITED AIR LINES, INC. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") and
the AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL (hereinafter referred to as "ALPA" or "the Association").</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">W I T N E S S E T H:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">It is mutually agreed that the 1994 AGREEMENT between UNITED AIR LINES,</P>
<P>INC. and THE AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL is amended as follows:</P>
<B><P>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Pay for April 2000 flying (paid in May 2000) will be paid at a rate that reflects</P>
<P>63.333% of the post-ESOP pay increase. This is an 11/30 reduction in the post-ESOP increase for the month of April 2000.</P>
<B><P>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>After the May 2000 paychecks have been processed, ISD will, to the extent the information is available in the Payroll system, begin to calculate the differential pay for Pilots who should receive additional pay for post-ESOP
actual flying, as follows:</P>
<B><P>B-1- </B>Lineholders shall be entitled to be paid at ESOP rates for the amount of actual flying performed on or prior to April 11, 2000, and at post-ESOP rates for the flying thereafter, unless the amount provided in "A", above, provides a higher
amount.</P>
<B><P>B-2- </B>Reserves shall be entitled to be paid for their ESOP activity either (1) for four hours and twenty minutes at ESOP rates for each reserve available day performed </P>
<B><P>Letter 00-4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 443</P>
</B><P>on or prior to April 11, 2000; or (2) if greater, for actual hours flown on or prior to April 11,2000. Reserves will be paid at post-ESOP rates for the remainder of April (not to exceed 78 hours of pay, unless the reserve is entitled to additional
pay due to having exceeded 78 flight hours or due to normal application of the deadhead credit rule.) Reserves will be entitled to be paid according to this computation unless the amount provided in "A", above, provides a higher amount.</P>
<B><P>B-3- </B>This pay verification process will begin not more than 30 days after the</P>
<P>second paycheck is issued in May 2000. In the event the Company is unable to accurately recreate ESOP earnings from Payroll data or if any pilot disagrees with the Company's calculation of his ESOP pay for any reason, the pilot may submit his CMS
record for April 2000 and the Company will, if necessary, recalculate his pay and make any corrections.</P>
<B><P>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>ESOP Earnings from May 1 and May 16, 2000 paychecks will be based upon</P>
<P>38.405% of the gross pay for the month. This is 12/30 of the month.</P>
<B><P>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The increase in the PDAP contribution from 1% to 9% will be handled as follows:</P>
<B><P>D-1- </B>11 days of April 2000 are at 1% and 19 days of April 2000 are at 9%, which results in the average percentage for the month being 6.202%. This percentage will be used for line pilots on both the May 1 and May 16, 2000 paychecks and will be
subject to the same adjustment, if any under "B" above.</P>
<B><P>D-2- </B>For the Pilot Instructors for the first half of the month of April 2000 the first 11 days are at 1% and the next 4 days of the month are at 9%, which results in the average percentage for the Friday, April 14, 2000 paycheck being 3.250%.</P>

<B><P>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Pilot pension ("A Plan") earnings for April 2000 flying will be based upon the book rates of pay.</P>
<B><P>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Pilot Bank will not be paid out. Pilot Bank payouts after May 2000 will receive the 9% PDAP payment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have signed this Agreement this 14th day of April, 2000.</P>

<P>Air Line Pilots Association</P>
<P>6400 Shafer Court, Suite 700</P>
<P>Rosemont, IL 60018</P>
<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<B><P>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Association through its Professional Standards Committee has undertaken training of its designated representatives, and is committed to ensuring that all designated Professional Standards representatives are trained to
competently assist any pilot who asks for help in resolving workplace-related problems with other pilots based on gender and/or minority issues. As with all issues undertaken by Professional Standards, voluntary participation of the affected pilots will
be essential to that process. Since the key to their success is rooted in the fact that Professional Standards' efforts are confidential, any pilot who becomes aware of a gender or minority complaint as a result of his or her official role in Professional
Standards activities will not be required to report that event to the Company. The goal of Professional Standards in handling these complaints will be to achieve behavior and attitude changes that will eliminate recurrence of the reported problems. No
changes will be made to the present Professional Standards operating rules in order to accommodate this new activity.</P>
<B><P>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When the Company receives a complaint, Flight Operations managers will have the option of initiating an investigation as specified in the Company's harassment/discrimination policy or of offering the pilot who makes a report the
option of first attempting to achieve resolution by taking the matter to ALPA Professional Standards. When offered, the decision to use or not use Professional Standards will be made entirely by the complaining pilot. In no case will the manager make a
recommendation to the pilot about which option to choose; however the manager will be free to answer all questions and to explain both processes, to the best of his or her understanding. If the complaining pilot chooses to use Professional Standards, the
responding pilot's concurrence will be required before the matter is referred to Professional Standards for resolution. If the complaining pilot chooses not to use Professional Standards, the Company will immediately take action as specified in its
harassment/discrimination policy. If a pilot chooses to use Professional Standards, he/she nonetheless may, at any time, report to the Company that he/she is not satisfied with the Professional.</P>
<B><P>Letter 00-6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 447</P>
</B><P>Standards progress and the Company will immediately initiate an investigation. In the event the pilots decide to use Professional Standards, the referral by the Company will be subject to all of the provisions of Letter of Agreement 87-1. If the
Company receives notice that Professional Standards is unable to reach a solution satisfactory to the complaining pilot, the Company will be responsible for taking any and all steps specified in its harassment and discrimination policy in an effort to
resolve the problem.</P>
<B><P>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If, after reporting to the Company a complaint based on gender or minority issues, a pilot then chooses to use Professional Standards, he/she will be required to sign a document saying that he/she received and read this Letter of
Agreement, which contains information relevant to his/her decision.</P>
<B><P>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>This agreement shall not be construed to limit, expand or otherwise modify the previous existing statutory responsibilities of either party. The activities that the Association will engage in under the provisions of this Letter
are activities that it will conduct on its own behalf and at its discretion, with neither influence nor control by the Company. In no respect will the Association function or serve as an agent of the Company in the handling of these matters.</P>
<B><P>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Agreement may be terminated by either party with 30 days advance notice.</P>

<P>Re: Memorandum of Understanding - Human Factors Land and Hold Short &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operations Simulator Study (LAHSO Study)</P>
<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P>Pursuant to our June 7 and 8, 2000 discussions, regarding the above-referenced</P>
<P>LAHSO study, the terms and conditions under which pilots will participate in the</P>
<P>program are as follows:</P>
<B><P>- </B>The LAHSO Study will be conducted for the sole purpose of data collection.</P>
<P>Therefore, no records, documents or notes produced during or as a result of the LAHSO Study will be placed in any pilot's personnel training record. Any</P>
<P>records, documents or notes produced during or as a result of the LAHSO Study will be de-identified. Moreover, no participating pilot (line holders and/or</P>
<P>reserve) will be subject to any instruction, checking, discipline, discharge or</P>
<P>enforcement action by the company during or as a result of their participation in the LAHSO Study.</P>
<B><P>- </B>It is agreed that the pilot briefing statement contained on page 19 of the FAA</P>
<P>Test Plan, dated June 6, 2000, will suffice as a statement from the FAA that no participating pilot (line holders and/or reserve) will be subject to any instruction, checking, discipline, enforcement action or certificate action by the FAA.</P>
<B><P>- </B>Participating line pilots will be paid and credited for the full value of any</P>
<P>missed trips.</P>
<B><P>- </B>Available lineholders can be used and if a lineholder volunteers on a day off,</P>
<P>he will receive a vacation day for each day of participation.</P>
<B><P>- </B>Participating reserve pilots will receive a reserve day of pay, presently four (4) hours and ten (10) minutes.</P>
<B><P>Page 450 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>- </B>All participating pilots will be compensated for any and all expenses, lodging</P>
<P>and transportation as provided for in Section 4 of the Collective Bargaining</P>
<P>Agreement.</P>
<B><P>- </B>Any and all pertinent company personnel must be appraised of and comply</P>

<P>This is to confirm that during the negotiations which led up to the 2000 Agreement, the Company and the Association agreed to establish a team of doctors composed of a representative of United, ALPA, and a third independent doctor highly qualified in
the field of crew rest and fatigue. This team shall be tasked to review and evaluate United's international scheduling practices and to develop recommendations of scheduling principles which recognize and address crew rest and fatigue.</P>
<P>The parties are committed, upon receipt of the final recommendations of the team of doctors, to meet forthwith to negotiate any and all changes in scheduling practices which, in light of the doctors' recommendations and other relevant factors, the
parties agree are appropriate.</P>
<P>If this accurately reflects our understanding, please sign and return two (2) copies for our files.</P>

<P>6400 Shafer Court, Suite 700</P>
<P>Rosemont, IL 60018</P>
<P>Dear Captain Dubinsky:</P>
<P>During the negotiations which led to the 2000 Agreement, the parties agreed to the following provisions pertaining to the introduction of new equipment:</P>
<B><P>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The provisions of the Agreement apply only to the aircraft types and aircraft series which are currently operated by United or on order by United, which include:</P>
<P>B-747-400 B-757-200</P>
<P>B-747-200 A-320</P>
<P>B-777-200 A-319</P>
<P>DC-10 B-727-200</P>
<P>DC-10F B-737-500</P>
<P>B-767-300 B-737-300</P>
<P>B-767-200 B-737-200.</P>
<B><P>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In the event United intends to operate any equipment type or series with a speed of .95M or below, and with a UAL certificated maximum takeoff weight (MTW) of less than one million pounds which is not included above, the
Association and the Company will begin negotiating rates of pay and working conditions for such new equipment as soon as orders have been placed and delivery dates have been established, or earlier by mutual agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Page 456 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter 00-13</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>During these new equipment negotiations, United will be free to bid vacancies, train pilots and prepare, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, for orderly introduction of the new equipment into service. If the parties are
not successful in reaching an agreement by the date United plans to introduce the new equipment, the new equipment will be flown in revenue service under Section 5 of the Agreement or under Section 3 of the International Supplement, whichever is applicable.</P>
<B><P>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Until final agreement is reached, pilots will fly the new equipment under the</P>
<P>following interim hourly rates. The new equipment pay rates will be established as follows:</P>
<B><P>4-a- </B>If the maximum takeoff weight (MTW) of the new equipment is less than</P>
<P>590,000 pounds, the hourly rate for captains and first officers will be:</P>
<P>(P1 - P0) (MTW-117) / 473 + P0. Where MTW is the maximum takeoff weight (MTW) of the new equipment, P0 is the B-737-200 hourly rate corresponding to the pilot's position and year of longevity, and P1 is the B-777 hourly rate for the pilot's position
and year of longevity; provided, however, no pilot who flies a B-737 aircraft not listed above will maintain an hourly rate less than the hourly rate established by the Agreement for B-737-200 aircraft.</P>
<B><P>4-b- </B>If the MTW of the new equipment is 590,000 pounds or greater, the hourly rate for captains and first officers will be: (P2 - P1) (MTW-590) / 285 + P1. Where MTW is the maximum takeoff weight (MTW) of the new equipment, P1 is the B-777
hourly rate for the pilot's position and year of longevity, and P2 is the B-747-400 hourly rate for the pilot's position and year of longevity.</P>
<B><P>4-c- </B>If the new equipment requires a minimum crew of 3 pilots, the hourly new equipment rate for any second officer on that equipment will be equal to the following: 1st year equals 1st year first officer rate for that equipment.</P>
<P>Thereafter the second officer rate will be equal to a percentage of the rate for</P>
<P>captains on that equipment according to the following:</P>
<P>2nd year = 32.0 percent of 2nd year captain rate</P>
<P>3rd year = 42.1 percent of 3rd year captain rate</P>
<P>4th year = 52.1 percent of 4th year captain rate</P>
<P>5th year = 53.1 percent of 5th year captain rate</P>
<P>6th year = 54.0 percent of 6th year captain rate</P>
<P>7th year = 54.6 percent of 7th year captain rate</P>
<P>8th year = 54.7 percent of 8th year captain rate</P>
<P>9th year = 54.8 percent of 9th year captain rate</P>
<P>10th year = 54.8 percent of 10th year captain rate</P>
<P>11th year = 54.8 percent of 11th year captain rate</P>
<P>12th year = 54.8 percent of 12th year captain rate.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Letter 00-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 457</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In the event, any Company aircraft listed above is re-certified resulting in an</P>
<P>increased MTW of 10,000 pounds or more, the appropriate new equipment formula above will be applied to establish new hourly rates for that aircraft. The new rates will become effective the first of the month following the re-certification of the MTW.

<P>Re: Cabotage</P>
<P>Dear Captain Woerth:</P>
<P>I write to confirm the following agreement made between the Air Line Pilots</P>
<P>Association, International ("ALPA") and United Airlines, Inc. ("United") in the</P>
<P>negotiations leading to the 2000 ALPA-United collective bargaining agreement (the "Agreement").</P>
<P>The parties agree that a change in U.S. law to permit foreign air carriers to engage in cabotage would be contrary to the long term commercial interests of the Company and the career security interests of the United pilots. The parties will work
together cooperatively to oppose strongly any such change in the law and inform members of Congress, the U.S. Administration, applicable foreign governments and international trade bodies, and other U.S. and foreign air carriers of such opposition. The
parties further agree that if there is such a change in the law, despite their efforts, they will meet to develop measures to protect against negative results to the Company and pilots' commercial and career interests.</P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P>This shall confirm our commitment to address a pilot's infrequent need to be relieved from flight duty in order to attend what we have termed a "life event" when he cannot secure relief using other provisions of the Agreement or Company Policy. </P>
<P>Understanding that we anticipate this procedure to be used for significant personal obligations such as a pilot's own wedding, the wedding of his child, religious right of passage of his child, his child's graduation or other qualitatively similar
events, and further understanding that we do not intend it to include his child's ball game, little league pictures, driving his child to camp and other qualitatively similar events, we venture into this agreement knowing ahead of time we will be mutually
obliged to exercise reasonable judgement. The foregoing being our best effort to describe our intent, it is agreed that a pilot who</P>
<P>1) gives the company notice of a life event prior to bidding, 2) tries to bid around it, but is unsuccessful and 3) tries to trade around it but is unsuccessful will be relieved of no more than one trip that conflicts with such life event barring the
most extraordinary circumstances.</P>
<P>A pilot whose request is honored will make-up the trip during the current month. If the pilot can demonstrate that making-up the trip is not possible during the month, he may take Authorized No Pay (ANP) or use his unassigned current vacation or his
next year's vacation to provide pay for the absence.</P>
<P>A pilot whose request is denied due to extraordinary circumstances shall be entitled to reconsideration of his request by his chief pilot within 48 hours of its denial. If the application of this letter should result in any unforeseen situations which
could produce a potential disruption in service, the parties agree to immediately seek to reach a mutual resolution of the problem prior to the Company taking any unilateral action.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>

<P>Re: UAL Pilot Scheduling Philosophy: Continual Improvement</P>
<P>Dear Captain Dubinsky:</P>
<P>This will confirm that, in section 6 negotiations leading up to the 2000 Contract, United and ALPA have committed to the following:</P>
<P>An explicit "UAL Pilot scheduling philosophy"</P>
<P>System Quality of Work Life (QWL) standards for domestic mainline pilot schedules</P>
<P>Enforceable plan for continued improvements in schedules and QWL Standards.</P>
<P>UAL Pilot Scheduling Philosophy - United and ALPA will strive to continually create less fatiguing, more reliable and more productive days of flying. In immediate support of this philosophy, within 60 days of ratification of the 2000 contract. United
will implement the following:</P>
<B><P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Build night flying to specific standards to address fatigue and quality issues</P>
<B><P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Minimize excessive short or long layovers which cause reliability, quality and human factor issues</P>
<B><P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Build lines of flying with improved pairing purity and improved days on/off</P>
<P>patterns. Demonstrated improvement in days off will be incorporated in these</P>
<P>enhancements. These lines recognize seniority with an emphasis on</P>
<P>concentrating high quality flying to the maximum number of senior lines.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Letter 00-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 62</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><P>System Quality of Work Life Standards - The following standards will apply after</P>
<P>ratification unless different standards are agreed upon by both the Company and</P>
<P>ALPA. These standards are contingent upon the elimination of the two for one rest provisions of the pilot working agreement, and based upon the daily 7 day domestic schedule:</P>
<B><P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>No more than 55% of turns </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>1 </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">in the same aircraft (System Average)</P>
<B><P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>No more than 55% of the lines of flying will have 270 or more hours Time Away From Base, unless both the SSC and the Company determine this limit has an adverse impact on purity and quality.</P>
<P>Provide contractual trip and duty RIGs in the actual operation so as to create</P>
<P>an economic incentive for the Company to minimize Time Away from base as</P>
<P>well as providing an economic benefit to the pilot when Time Away From</P>
<P>Base becomes higher than scheduled. Schedules that do not meet these standards will not be published without agreement with ALPA. The techniques used to achieve these standards will be applied across all domestic mainline fleets consistently unless
excepted by agreement with the SSC or by external events such as major ATC system disruption, government action affecting</P>
<P>a fleet type, concerted labor activity, or a long term disruption of service due to a</P>
<P>natural disaster.</P>
<P>Plan for Continual Improvement - The Company and ALPA will sponsor a Joint</P>
<P>Committee to monitor and evaluate how well the above standards serve both the pilots and the Company. Additionally, the Joint Committee will continue to explore methods to improve pilot schedules and quality of work life.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Joint Committee will convene immediately and will, within two (2) weeks, submit a working plan and schedule to the MEC Chairman and UAL's Chief Operating Officer for their approval. United will assign a full time analyst to this
project for a period of at least six (6) months. The subcommittee will explore additional computer programming and other opportunities to implement changes to modify, improve and maintain schedule quality consistent with a changing airline. Reduction in
Time Away from Home</P>
<P>will be a high priority of the Committee's study. It will submit written progress</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS LETTER OF AGREEMENT is made and entered into in accordance with the provisions of Title II of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, by and between UNITED AIR LINES, INC. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") and
the AIR LINE PILOTS in the service of UNITED AIR LINES, INC. as represented by the AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL (hereinafter referred to as "ALPA" or the "Association")</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">WITNESSETH:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company and the Association wish to state the Agreement they have reached with respect to Short Term Disability</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed that the following provisions shall apply in the administration of a Short Term Disability policy: A pilot who is disabled due to illness, non-occupational injury or pregnancy, but whose
disability does not qualify the pilot to receive Pilot Disability Income Benefits, will be eligible for Short Term Disability ("STD") benefits subject to the following:</P>
<P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pilot is eligible for STD from date of hire.</P>
<P>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon exhaustion of the pilot's non-occupational sick leave bank the company will pay the pilot an amount equal to 55% of pay based upon the minimum monthly guarantee for up to a maximum of 90 days. Partial months will be prorated on a
calendar day basis (number of days disabled divided by the number of days in the bid month). Such benefit will be considered earnings for the Fixed Benefit Plan but will not be considered earnings for the purpose of any other employee benefit plan
including, but not limited to, PDAP and Pilot Disability Benefits.</P>
<P>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for the benefit, the pilot must be under a doctor's care for treatment of the condition and the pilot must be medically unable to work. In the case of pregnancy, a pilot who requests STD will be considered medically
unable to work. during the period of pregnancy and for a period of up to 90 days following the date of delivery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Letter 00-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 66</P>
</B><P>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are questions regarding the extent to which the pilot is disabled, the Company's Regional Medical Offices will be responsible for reviewing the medical documentation, requesting any additional information deemed
appropriate, and approving the request. If there is disagreement between the Company physician and the pilot's physician, the pilot may request Medical Arbitration by a disinterested third party. If the pilot requests medical arbitration, the Company's
doctor and the pilot's doctor will mutually agree upon a third physician to examine the pilot. The Medical Department will arrange for the consultation, and the decision of the majority will be binding on the Company and the pilot. The pilot and the
Company will each be responsible for one half the fee of the mutually agreed upon examiner. A pilot who initiates medical arbitration will be provided with compensation pursuant to STD. This compensation will be refunded to the Company if the Company
prevails in medical arbitration.</P>
<P>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This benefit is not payable (i) for any illness or injury arising out of or in the course of employment with UA for which the pilot is receiving Worker's</P>
<P>Compensation benefits, (ii) after termination of the pilot's employment with United, and (iii) for any disability that begins while a pilot is on an unpaid leave of absence.</P>
<P>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STD benefit will be restored upon return to active employment as a line pilot for a period of 12 months which need not be consecutive (active employment is any month in which the pilot receives at least fifty (50) credit hours
flight time credit and/or vacation credit).</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have signed this Letter of Agreement this 26<SUP>th</SUP> day of October, 2000.</P>

<P>Re: Pilot Seniority Dates for ''the 570'' Pilot Group</P>
<P>Dear Captain Dubinsky,</P>
<P>This will confirm the parties agreement to change both the pilot and second officer seniority dates (the classification dates) and the company hire dates for the group of pilots commonly known as ''the 570'' from the date of May 17, 1985 to the date
upon which each of these pilots actually commenced training. Those dates occurred during the period commencing on December l 1, 1984 and continuing through May 16, 1985.</P>
<P>This change will bring these dates of this group into conformity with the rest of</P>
<P>United's pilots. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a list reflecting the date upon which members of the 570 commenced training, which date will become the new pilot and second officer seniority date and company hire date for each such pilot. The only
exception to this is if the pilot's company hire date is earlier than the date displayed, in which case the earlier date will be retained.</P>
<P>The parties further agree that these new dates will affect the contractual rights and benefits of those pilots on a prospective basis only.</P>
<P>If this letter accurately reflects our agreement, please sign and return three (3) copies for our files.</P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P>During the negotiations leading to the 2000 Agreement, the parties agreed to the</P>
<P>following:</P>
<P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;The parties have jointly developed a display page to provide the means for a pilot to request a particular Pilot Instructor or Standards Captain prior to reporting to DENTK. The Company will honor such requests when doing so will not
disrupt a Pilot Instructor's or Standards Captain's previously arranged schedule.</P>
<P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;PI's acting as fill-in crew members will participate in PC/CQP/PT's to the same extent as that required of normal line pilots. Additionally, the Company will publish PC/CQP/PT fill-in guidelines in relevant Fleet and Flight Center
documents. These fill-in guidelines will be distributed to each PI prior to serving as a fill-in on a checking assignment.</P>
<P>-&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties have jointly developed a handout for type rated First Officers acting as Captains during training and PC/CQP/PT's. These handouts will be distributed to type rated First Officers prior to acting as a Captain during training
and PC/CQP/PT's.</P>
<P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary pilots taking their nine month PC/CQP will not be graded to different standards than those required to successfully complete the initial transition course.</P>
<P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to Flight Operations Policy regarding home study prior to DENTK transition study, all transition course curricula are established independent of any home study considerations and, therefore, home study is not required prior
to reporting to DENTK. All pilots will be treated fairly and consistently under this policy.</P>
<P>- &nbsp;&nbsp;The parties will jointly develop a display page to provide the means for a pilot to request a hotel room for the night before reporting to DENTK for a PC/CQP. When requested, the Company will provide a hotel room the night before a PC/CQP.

<P>Rosemont, Illinois 60018</P>
<P>Dear Rick:</P>
<P>Due to the closing of the Anchorage domicile, and recognizing the unique geographic circumstances associated with this domicile, a pilot who holds an Anchorage bid and exercises a bump under Section 8-O of the 2000 Agreement ("the Agreement") will be
eligible for the following provisions:</P>
<B><P>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A pilot will be entitled to a paid move under the provisions of Section 10 of the Agreement. However, if the pilot is moving his primary residence from Alaska, the pilot will have up to thirty-six (36) months from the date of
activation in his new assignment to complete his household move.</P>
<B><P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>If a pilot who holds an Anchorage bid never exercised his paid move entitlement as stated in Section 10-A-3-g of the Agreement, the Company will pay to move his household goods from Alaska, even if he bumps back to the domicile
at which he was based prior to receiving his Anchorage bid. However, the Company will only pay to move household goods after the pilot has first exhausted the 1000-pound NRSA COMAT limits.</P>
<B><P>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The three (3) transfer days addressed in Section 10-A-2-a and 10-A-3 of the Agreement will be increased to five (5) days.</P>
<B><P>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A pilot will be eligible for up to four (4) house hunting days to be used</P>
<P>consecutively; with the understanding that the Company will only reimburse house hunting expenses for up to four (4) days and three (3) nights.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Letter 00-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 74</P>
<P>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>An Anchorage pilot covered by this letter, and who maintains his primary residence in Alaska, shall be provided BP-3 NRPS transport between Anchorage and his domicile for each scheduled trip pairing or for each consecutive series of
reserve days until the day the pilot completes his household move from Alaska or December 23, 2002, whichever occurs earlier. Provided the pilot has not relocated his primary residence from Alaska prior to December 23, 2002, he will be eligible for BP-7
NRSA transportation between Anchorage and his domicile for each scheduled trip pairing or for each consecutive series of reserve days until the day the pilot completes his</P>
<P>household move from Alaska or December 23, 2002, whichever occurs earlier.</P>
<B><P>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A pilot and his eligible dependents will be entitled to a one-way BP-3 NRPS ticket from Anchorage for the purpose of relocating to a new primary residence.</P>
<B><P>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If a pilot exercised a paid move entitlement after receiving his Anchorage bid and moved more than 25,000 pounds to Alaska (as reflected in Company records), the pilot will, as a result of exercising his bump, be eligible to move
up to the same amount of household goods from his Alaska primary residence to his new residence.</P>
<B><P>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Should a pilot choose to drive a vehicle from Alaska to his new domicile/residence, the pilot will be eligible for a number of travel days equal to the distance between Anchorage and and the pilots new domicile divided by 400.
These travel days must be used consecutively, and the pilot must furnish receipts (e.g. gas, meals, lodging, etc.) to document that he did drive during the travel day period.</P>
<B><P>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A pilot who maintains his primary residence in Alaska will retain parking privileges at Anchorage International Airport until he completes his household move.</P>
<B><P>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Until November 22, 2001, a pilot who maintains his primary residence in</P>
<P>Anchorage and who travels from Anchorage to Denver for a PC/CQP/PT will be eligible for a travel day immediately prior to and immediately following the training event.</P>
<B><P>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A pilot will not be scheduled for training over the 2000 Christmas holiday.</P>
<B><P>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; </B>The Company will make every effort to allow a pilot to move a training date for the purpose of avoiding a planned vacation, unless such an action results in a lost training slot or adversely impacts the needs of the operation.</P>

<B><P>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>As a clarification, the provisions of Section 11-E-3 will apply to a pilot's vacation assignments.</P>
<B><P>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Company will continue to provide support for ANCFO until the Anchorage domicile is closed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Page 75 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter 00-28</P>
<P>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Any pilot who bumps from Anchorage as a result of the domicile closing will be entitled to "grandfather" rights back to Anchorage should the Company reopen an Anchorage domicile prior to November 22, 2005. A pilot returning to the
Anchorage domicile under this provision will be entitled to activation into the assignment that he has seniority to hold systemwide. A pilot's "grandfather" rights will expire on November 22, 2005, or on the date the Company offers the pilot an Anchorage
domicile assignment, if earlier, regardless of whether the pilot accepts or rejects the assignment.</P>
<B><P>16. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Except as specifically modified by this letter, the provisions of Section 8 and Section 10 of the Agreement will apply to the Anchorage domicile closing.</P>
<B><P>17. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Company and the Association agree that this letter of agreement</P>
<P>encompasses the complete and final entitlement available to pilots bumping from Anchorage as a result of the domicile closing.</P>
<B><P>18. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The parties agree that this letter of agreement is entered into on a no precedent basis and will not be used by either party in any similar future situation.</P>

</B><I><P>Navigating Change Workshop</P>
</I><B><P>United Airlines/ALPA</P>
</B><P>December 2000</P>
<P>To all United Pilots,</P>
<P>You may have heard that a committee of four ALPA and four Company appointees has been working for many months on an educational project about minority and gender issues that are relevant to our United pilot group. A letter of Agreement signed by the
Association and the Company directed this project. As a result of this joint initiative, some permanent changes will be made, most notably to our instructor training and to our new-hire curriculum.</P>
<P>The initial activity is a seminar called the "Navigating Change Workshop." This workshop is directed to pilots who are in leadership positions: primarily LCA's, DENTK personnel, ALPA officials and Flight Operations management. The purpose of the
workshop is to give these leaders enough understanding of diversity related issues to provide relevant and guidance to fellow pilots who have had problems or difficulties working with pilots of a different race, gender</P>
<P>or other minority status.</P>
<P>We believe this goal has been achieved. The workshop will provide useful information and techniques to recognize and avoid participating in inappropriate behavior and also to constructively respond to inappropriate behavior should it occur, either as
an individual or with ALPA and Company support. It is far more comprehensive than previous efforts to address this subject.</P>
<P>Many of you will not be required to attend the workshop; however, you may be affected by it. We want you to have factual information about what it is. These workshop issues are an easy "lightening rod" for criticism, usually not based on program
content, but rather on the point of view of the observer. The joint development committee has succeeded in developing a program based entirely on common sense and maturity -- and it requires only these two values be used</P>
<P>when viewing or commenting on its content. We believe this program will prove to be of great value to all of our pilots.</P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P>As a result of discussions between the parties, it has been agreed that the Company may operate B777 two (2) pilot aircraft on a single segment consisting of a Pacific Crossing of more than twelve (12) and less than sixteen (16) hours.</P>
<P>The crew complement will consist of a Captain and three (3) First Officers who hold an ATP certificate with a type rating in the operating aircraft.</P>
<P>The duty time limitations of Section 3-A-7 and Section 3-N-3 and the legal rest</P>
<P>minimums of Section 3-M of the International Agreement shall apply. The designated pilot rest facility will be as follows:</P>
<P>B777 (with First class Suite) 2 First Class Suites (3A and 3J)</P>
<P>B777 (with the cockpit crew bunk and no First Class Suite)</P>
<P>Crew Bunk Facility and 2 Business class seats (Left bulkhead window</P>
<P>and aisle)</P>
<P>The Company may not substitute any other B777 aircraft to accomplish this flying which does not have the required rest facility outlined above. The new overhead bunk facility once available from Boeing will be installed during each aircraft's heavy
maintenance visit.</P>
<P>Flight Operations will work with the Onboard Division to seek opportunities to</P>
<P>minimize flight attendant activity in the area of door 1L during periods of pilot crew rest. Should these arrangements prove unsatisfactory, either ALPA or the Company may terminate this agreement with sixty (60) days notice prior to the awarding of
pilot monthly schedules in the B777 domicile in which the scheduled flying described above is assigned.</P>

<P>Dear Captain Dubinsky,</P>
<P>On March 29, 1995, the parties agreed to not assign new-hire pilots for their initial assignment to wide-body First Officer positions in an international operation. After discussions with ALPA regarding this agreement, the parties have agreed to
modify this restriction in Letter 99-8 (Wide-Body First Officer) to the following extent to allow a new hire to be initially assigned to a B-757/767 First Officer position under the following conditions:</P>
<B><P>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The new-hire pilot will be assigned to domestic flying until he has performed a minimum of 250 actual hours of flying.</P>
<B><P>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The new-hire pilot will not be awarded a lateral to another international B-757/767 domicile until he has completed the required 250 actual hours of domestic flying.</P>
<P>If this adequately reflects our discussion and our agreement, please sign and return two (2) copies to me for our files.</P>

<P>UAL-MEC Air Line Pilots Association</P>
<P>6400 Shafer court, Suite 700</P>
<P>Rosemont, IL 60018</P>
<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P>The parties have agreed to amend the 2000 pilot Agreement as follows:</P>
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Revise the second sentence in Section 8-K-1 to read: "Such notice shall be given not less than thirty (30) days nor more than one hundred twenty-five (125) days prior to the date of displacement."</P>
<P>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Revise Section 9-B-1-a to read: "All pilots shall be notified as far in advance as possible but in no case less than fourteen (14) days prior to being scheduled to receive transition or extended training of five (5) days or more.
However, if a pilot is returning to work from an absence and he needs requalification or transition training, this fourteen (14) day minimum notification may be reduced to seven (7) days. These minimum notification requirements may be further reduced only
with pilot concurrence. Official notice of training assignments will be conveyed through the pilot's Company mail box and by electronic notification. If, however, a pilot's schedule shows that he does not have any duty following the initiation of the
notice, or that the pilot has not checked the electronic notification, the company will make an effort to contact him by telephone within seven (7) days of the original</P>
<P>notification. If this attempt is unsuccessful, a letter will be sent by U.S. mail to his home of record. If a pilot volunteers for training with less than fourteen (14) days notice of a training assignment of this type and does not have a scheduled
calendar day off between the time of notification and the time he is required to depart his domicile, he will be provided with a calendar day off within seven (7) days from departing his domicile."</P>
<P>Since these changes were agreed to prior to the publication of the 2000 pilot</P>
<P>Agreement, these amendments will be incorporated into the body of the Agreement and this letter will be referenced in Section 22.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11-D of the Agreement, the parties have agreed that pilots surplussed as a result of an equipment domicile closing who are awarded a bump but are not on the domicile roster at their new assignment as of
January 1, will be permitted to bid their annual vacation during the annual vacation bidding period at their bump assignment.</P>

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>To UAL Corporation:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We have audited the accompanying statements of financial position of
the Employees' Stock Purchase Plan of UAL Corporation (the "Plan") as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the related statements of changes in participants'
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000.&nbsp;
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's administrator.&nbsp;
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States.&nbsp; Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.&nbsp; An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.&nbsp; An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Plan's
administrator, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.&nbsp;
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Plan as of December
31, 2000 and 1999 and the changes in its participants' equity for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

<p><br>
<br>
<p><u>(1)&nbsp; The Plan</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Employees' Stock
Purchase Plan of UAL Corporation (the "Plan") is sponsored by UAL Corporation
("UAL").&nbsp; UAL offers participation in the Plan to eligible employees
of UAL and its subsidiaries.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><u>(2)&nbsp; Purchase and Distribution of Stock</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchases are made
by the Plan monthly, and the shares purchased are credited to the accounts
of each participant on the basis of the ratio of the participant's contribution
to total participants' contributions for the month.&nbsp; The cost of common
stock purchased for the Plan includes all brokerage charges involved in
the purchase.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When shares of stock
are distributed to the individual participants pursuant to the terms of
the Plan, the market value of such shares is removed from the investment
account of the Plan.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terminating participants
receive a certificate for the full number of shares, plus cash for the
fractional shares, held for their accounts.&nbsp; Partially withdrawing
participants receive certificates for the full number of shares withdrawn.&nbsp;
There are no forfeiture provisions under the Plan with respect to participants'
contributions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><u>(3)&nbsp; Investment in Common Stock of UAL</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investment in common
stock of UAL is valued at year-end published market prices as reported
by the New York Stock Exchange.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><u>(4)&nbsp; Realized Gain on Stock Distributed to Participants</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gains on stock distributed
to participants are realized to the extent of the difference between the
weighted average cost of shares distributed and the market value at the
date of distribution.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) in the value of investment is the change from the prior
year-end to the current year-end in the difference between the market value
and the cost of the investment.&nbsp; The following is a summary of unrealized
appreciation (depreciation):
