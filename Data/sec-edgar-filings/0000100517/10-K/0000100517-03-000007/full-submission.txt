<p><b>ITEM 1.&nbsp; BUSINESS.</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL Corporation ("UAL" or
the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on December 30, 1968.&nbsp; The world headquarters of the Company is located
at 1200 East Algonquin Road, Elk Grove Township, Illinois 60007.&nbsp;
The Company's mailing address is P.O. Box 66919, Chicago, Illinois 60666.&nbsp;
The telephone number for the Company is (847) 700-4000.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL is a holding company
and its principal, wholly owned subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("United").&nbsp; United's operations, which consist
primarily of the transportation of persons, property and mail throughout
the U.S. and abroad, accounted for most of the Company's revenues and expenses
in 2002.&nbsp; United is the second largest scheduled passenger airline
in the world and for the full year 2002 was the industry leader in domestic
on-time performance, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's web address
is www.united.com.&nbsp; Through the Company's web site, its annual report
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K,
and all amendments to those reports are made available (free of charge)
as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically
filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<p><i><font size=-1>This Form 10-K contains various "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking
statements represent the Company's expectations and beliefs concerning
future events, based on information available to the Company on the date
of the filing of this Form 10-K, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
referenced in the forward-looking statements are listed in the last paragraph
of the section, "Outlook for 2003" in <u>Item 7. Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</u>.</font></i>
<p><i><font size=-1>The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update
or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether in response to
new information, unforeseen events, changed circumstances or otherwise.</font></i>
<p><b><u>Bankruptcy Considerations</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 9, 2002 (the
"Petition Date"), UAL, United and 26 other direct and indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for
relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division, in Chicago (the "Bankruptcy Court") under case numbers 02-B-48191
through 02-B-48218 (the "Chapter 11 Cases"). Specific information pertaining
to the bankruptcy filing may be obtained from the website www.pd-ual.com.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Debtors are currently
operating their business as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable
court orders.&nbsp; In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are
authorized under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business,
but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business
without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes in consumer behavior,
particularly the reduction in business travel and the changes in business
travel patterns, have led to a significant decline in revenues, yield and
revenue passenger miles for United, which in turn have severely impacted
the Company's financial condition and United's ability to meet some of
its maturing debt obligations. The Company filed for bankruptcy because
the Chapter 11 process offered the best available means to facilitate the
implementation of necessary changes to the Debtors' business to bring costs
and operations in line with the current business environment.&nbsp; In
addition, the protections of the Chapter 11 process offered the Debtors
access to capital through debtor-in-possession financing that otherwise
would not have been available.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Petition Date, the
Bankruptcy Court gave interim approval for an aggregate of up to $1.5 billion
in debtor-in-possession secured financing (the "DIP Financing"). The DIP
Financing is structured as a $300 million facility from Bank One, NA (the
"Bank One Facility") and a $1.2 billion facility provided by a group led
by JPMorgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank One, NA and The CIT Group/Business
Credit, Inc. (the "Club Facility").&nbsp; The Company has received commitments
of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility following the completion of the
syndication process for that facility; the balance is conditioned upon
the participation of one or more additional lenders, subject to approval
by the existing participants.&nbsp; The Company currently has access to
the entire Bank One Facility and to $500 million of the Club Facility.
Access to the balance of the Club Facility is subject to specified terms
of that facility.&nbsp; These terms require that the Company achieve performance
milestones under its business plan, which include substantial cost savings
in the near term.&nbsp; Final approval of the DIP Financing was granted
by the Bankruptcy Court on December 30, 2002.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United's DIP Financing
requires compliance with a number of financial covenants, including the
achievement of specified earnings thresholds.&nbsp; The adverse economic
impact of external events, such as those described below in "Fuel," "Conflict
with Iraq" and "Employees - Labor Matters," if not offset by the achievement
of savings elsewhere, could lead to the breach of one or more of those
covenants and, absent a waiver from the DIP lenders, their foreclosure
on substantial assets United needs to operate its business.&nbsp; For more
information on the DIP Financing, see Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to exit Chapter
11 successfully, the Company will need to propose, and obtain confirmation
by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would resolve,
among other things, the Debtors' pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for
its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy. On March 21,
2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the extension to October 2003 of the
Company's "exclusivity period," during which it is the only party permitted
to file a plan of reorganization.&nbsp; Under certain circumstances, the
exclusivity period could be shortened by two months. The timing of filing
a plan of reorganization by the Company will depend on the timing and outcome
of numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases. Although the
Company expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides for its
emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance
at this time that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically stays
most actions against a debtor, including most actions to collect pre-petition
indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the debtor's estate.&nbsp;
Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition
liabilities are subject to settlement under the plan of reorganization.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the preceding
general discussion of the automatic stay, the Debtors' rights to possess
and operate certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related
equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional
sale contract are governed by a particular provision of the Bankruptcy
Code that specifies different treatment. Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code ("Section 1110") provides that unless the Debtors take certain action,
within 60 days after the Petition Date or such later date as is agreed
by the applicable lessor, secured party, or conditional vendor, the contractual
rights of such financier to take possession of such equipment and to enforce
any of its other rights or remedies under the applicable agreement are
not limited or otherwise affected by the automatic stay or any other provision
of the Bankruptcy Code. For more information on Section 1110, see "Properties
- - Flight Equipment" under Item 2 below and Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain
executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property,
aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and certain other conditions.&nbsp; In general, rejection of an unexpired
lease or executory contract is treated as a pre-petition breach of the
lease or contract in question. Subject to certain exceptions, this rejection
relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under that
lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a
pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by the deemed breach.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counterparties to these rejected
contracts or leases may file proofs of claim against the Debtors' estate
for such damages.&nbsp; Due to the uncertain nature of many of the potential
rejection and abandonment related claims, the Company is unable to project
the magnitude of these claims with any degree of certainty at this time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, the assumption
of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires a debtor to cure most
existing defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bankruptcy Code provides
special treatment for collective bargaining agreements ("CBAs"). In particular,
Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code permits the Company to move to reject
its collective bargaining agreements if the Company first satisfies a number
of statutorily prescribed substantive and procedural prerequisites and
obtains the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the rejection. After bargaining
in good faith and sharing relevant information with its unions, the debtor
must make proposals to modify its existing CBAs based on the most complete
and reliable information available at the time. The proposed modifications
must be necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and must ensure
that all the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably relative
to the creditors and the debtor. Ultimately, rejection is appropriate if
the unions refuse to agree to the debtors necessary proposals "without
good cause" and the balance of the equities favors rejection. See "Employees
- - Labor Matters" below under this Item 1 and "Labor Matters" under <u>Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States Trustee
for the Northern District of Illinois (the "U.S. Trustee") has appointed
an official committee of unsecured creditors (the "Creditors' Committee").&nbsp;
The Creditors' Committee and its legal representatives have a right to
be heard on all matters that come before the Bankruptcy Court.&nbsp; There
can be no assurance that the Creditors' Committee will support the Debtors'
positions or the Debtors' ultimate plan of reorganization, once proposed,
and disagreements between the Debtors and the Creditors' Committee could
protract the Chapter 11 Cases, could negatively impact the Debtors' ability
to operate during the Chapter 11 Cases and could prevent the Debtors' emergence
from Chapter 11.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, it is not possible
to predict accurately the effect of the Chapter 11 reorganization process
on the Company's business or when it may emerge from Chapter 11.&nbsp;
The Company's future results depend on the timely and successful confirmation
and implementation of a plan of reorganization. The rights and claims of
various creditors and security holders will be determined by the plan as
well.&nbsp; No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be
ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies,
and it is possible that UAL's equity or other securities will be restructured
in a manner that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value.
Accordingly, the Company urges that appropriate caution be exercised with
respect to existing and future investments in any of such securities and
claims.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 24, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court entered a preliminary injunction in order to restrict
the trading of the Company's common stock and debt interests in the Company.
The purpose of the preliminary injunction was to ensure that the Company
did not lose the benefit of its net operating loss ("NOL"). Under federal
and state income tax law, an NOL can be used to offset future taxable income,
and thus is an extremely valuable asset. However, a company can lose the
benefit of its NOLs if the company is deemed to undergo an "ownership change"
under certain very specific tax rules in the Internal Revenue Code. Excessive
trading in a company's stock (or debt when the company is in bankruptcy)
can trigger such an "ownership change," and thus the Company sought to
restrict the trading of the Company's common stock and debt interests.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the terms of the preliminary
injunction, no person can buy or sell UAL stock if that person holds more
than 4.8 million shares of UAL common stock or would hold more than 4.8
million shares after the purchase. Any person who holds more than $200
million in debt claims against UAL must register as a "substantial claimholder"
with UAL, and no person may acquire debt claims against UAL if the acquisition
of the claims would cause them to hold more than $200 million in such claims.
See Note 7, "Income Taxes" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p><b><i>Plan for Transformation</i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Central to UAL's reorganization
and emergence from Chapter 11 is its plan for transformation, which outlines
the fundamental changes to United's strategic direction. The plan, which
the Company seeks to refine through further collaboration with its employee
and creditor constituencies, is intended to lay the foundation for a company
that is successful and competitive for the long run. Core objectives of
the plan are the reduction of United's labor and non-labor costs and the
development of a more comprehensive and compelling portfolio of products.
Key operational elements of the plan include: (1) the preservation and
enhancement of United's extensive mainline service targeted primarily at
the business traveler; (2) the creation of a low-cost offering to compete
directly with low-cost carriers for leisure and price-sensitive travelers;
(3) the growth of the Company's United Express regional operations and
(4) the expansion of United's domestic and international alliances. See

<p><b><u>Operations</u></b>
<p><b><i>Segments.</i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL operates its businesses
through five reporting segments:&nbsp; North America, the Pacific, the
Atlantic and Latin America, each of which is operated by United, and UAL
Loyalty Services, Inc. ("ULS").&nbsp; Financial information on UAL's operating
segments can be found in Note 23, "Segment Information" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2002, United carried
approximately 69 million passengers and flew approximately 109 billion
revenue passenger miles.&nbsp; United's network provides comprehensive
transportation service within its North American segment and to international
destinations within its Pacific, Atlantic and Latin America segments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating revenues attributed to
United's North America segment were $8.8 billion in 2002, $10.7 billion
in 2001 and $13.1 billion in 2000.&nbsp; Operating revenues attributed
to United's international segments were $4.7 billion in 2002, $5.4 billion
in 2001 and $6.2 billion in 2000.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>North America</u>.&nbsp;
As of March 24, 2003, United serves approximately 83 destinations throughout
North America and operates hubs in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco
and Washington, D.C.&nbsp; United's North America operations accounted
for 61.9% of UAL's revenues in 2002.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Pacific</u>.&nbsp; Via
its Tokyo hub, United provides passenger service between its U.S. gateway
cities (Chicago, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle)
and the Asian cities of Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and
Taipei. United also provides nonstop service between Hong Kong and each
of Chicago and San Francisco; between San Francisco and each of Osaka,
Shanghai, Sydney and Melbourne (via Sydney); between Los Angeles and Sydney
and Melbourne (via Sydney); and between Chicago and Beijing. In 2002, United's
Pacific operations accounted for 16.9% of UAL's operating revenues.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Atlantic</u>.&nbsp; Washington,
D.C. is United's primary gateway to Europe, serving Amsterdam, Brussels,
Frankfurt, London, Munich and Paris.&nbsp; Chicago is United's secondary
gateway to Europe, with nonstop service to Frankfurt, London and Paris.&nbsp;
United also provides nonstop service between San Francisco and each of
London and Frankfurt; and between London and each of Los Angeles, Newark
and New York. In 2002, United's Atlantic operations accounted for 12.9%
of UAL's operating revenues.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Latin America</u>.&nbsp;
United's primary gateway to Latin America is Washington, D.C., providing
service from Washington, D.C. to Aruba, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro (one-stop),
Sao Paolo, San Juan and St. Thomas.&nbsp; United also provides service
from Mexico City to each of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington,
D.C., and San Jose (Costa Rica).&nbsp; In addition, United has service
from Chicago to Aruba, Montevideo (one-stop), San Juan, Sao Paulo and St.
Thomas; between Miami and Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo; between Los Angeles
and Guatemala City, San Jose (one-stop) and San Salvador; between New York
and San Juan; and between Guatemala City and San Jose. In 2002, United's
Latin America operations accounted for 3.4% of UAL's revenues.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>UAL Loyalty Services,
Inc</u>.&nbsp; UAL Loyalty Services, Inc. ("ULS") is the fifth reporting
segment of UAL's operations and accounted for 4.9% of UAL's 2002 revenues.&nbsp;
ULS focuses on expanding the non-core marketing businesses of UAL and building
customer loyalty for United and others.&nbsp; ULS operates in four areas:&nbsp;
loyalty programs, travel distribution, direct-to-consumer services and
media assets.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ULS operates substantially
all United-branded travel distribution and customer loyalty e-commerce
activities, such as united.com, and also owns and manages UAL's interests
in various third-party e-commerce enterprises, such as Orbitz and Hotwire.&nbsp;
In addition, as of the first quarter of 2002, ULS owns and operates the
Mileage Plus frequent flyer programs and is responsible for certain aspects
of it, including member relationships, communications and account management,
while United continues to be responsible for the elite frequent flyer aspects
of the program, including the Premier, Premier Executive and Premier Executive
1K programs, as well as the air travel accrual and award aspects of the
program.&nbsp; United also retains responsibility for managing the relationship
with Mileage Plus' airline partners, while ULS manages relationships with
non-airline business partners, such as the Mileage Plus Visa Card, hotels,
car rental companies and dining programs. ULS also owns and operates certain
other United-branded customer programs as well as the MyPoints.com online
loyalty program, under which registered consumers earn points for goods
and services purchased from participating vendors.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>United Cargo<sup>&reg;</sup>.</i></b>&nbsp;
United Cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through its
Small Package Delivery; T.D. Guaranteed; First Freight; International Freight;
UA 2-Day service; and United SameDay.&nbsp; Freight accounts for most of
United Cargo's shipments, while mail remains an important component of
United's cargo strategy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the year 2002, United
Cargo generated approximately $673 million in freight and mail revenue,
which represents a 4.4% decrease versus 2001.&nbsp; Traffic has gradually
improved, but volumes remain below pre-September 11, 2001 levels.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August 2002, United Cargo
opened a new cargo warehouse facility in Chicago, which is presently the
largest facility for processing freight and mail in North America.&nbsp;
This completes United Cargo's planned investment in facilities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January of 2003, United
Cargo, along with Unisys Corporation and two other cargo carriers, launched
Cargo Portal Services, an internet portal that allows freight forwarders
to book and manage shipments more easily through the delivery cycle.&nbsp;
By providing enhanced computer-based communications between customers and
air carriers, United expects Cargo Portal Services to reduce transaction
costs for both United and its customers.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Fuel.</i></b>&nbsp;
Fuel is United's second largest cost behind labor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's
fuel costs and consumption for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price and availability of jet
fuel significantly affect United's operations. Based on projected 2003
fuel consumption, the Company estimates that every $0.01 change in the
average annual price-per-gallon of jet fuel will impact United's 2003 fuel
costs by approximately $21 million, absent any fuel hedging arrangements.&nbsp;
Due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, United may
be unable to pass on to its customers any increased fuel costs that it
may encounter.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help mitigate against
price increases, United in the past has entered into hedging arrangements.
In 2002, United hedged 26% of its fuel consumption using crude oil and
heating oil swaps.&nbsp; United had also put in place hedges for 7% of
its estimated fuel consumption for the first half of 2003 (the impact of
these hedges is included in the total fuel cost shown above).&nbsp; However,
as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the derivatives counterparties
terminated all outstanding swap contracts, leaving United completely unhedged.&nbsp;
As market conditions and its economic outlook change, the Company continually
evaluates the potential economic benefit of entering into fuel hedging
arrangements.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure adequate supplies
of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs, United ships
fuel on major pipelines and stores fuel close to its major hub locations.&nbsp;
Although the Company currently does not anticipate a significant reduction
in the availability of jet fuel, a number of factors make accurate predictions
impossible, including geopolitical uncertainties in oil-producing nations.&nbsp;
For example, hostilities in Iraq could lead to disruptions in oil production
and/or to substantially increased oil prices.&nbsp; The continuing political
turmoil in Venezuela also could have similar effects.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Insurance.</i></b>&nbsp;
United carries hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the
air transportation industry, in amounts which it deems adequate, covering
passenger liability, public liability and damage to United's aircraft and
other physical property.&nbsp; However, as a result of the September 11,
2001 terrorist attacks, the premiums have increased significantly.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, after September
11, 2001 commercial insurers cancelled United's liability insurance for
losses resulting from war perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other
similar perils), but United obtained replacement coverage through the FAA.&nbsp;
Under the Homeland Security Act, which became effective in February 2003,
the FAA is authorized to offer this insurance through August 31, 2003,
and it may be extended to December 31, 2003, if the federal government
determines such an extension is in the national interest.&nbsp; Likewise,
United maintains hull war risk insurance through the FAA program, which
provides worldwide coverage for war and associated perils (including hijacking
and confiscation).&nbsp; There can be no assurance, however, that the FAA
insurance will continue to be available.&nbsp; Should the FAA discontinue
this coverage, obtaining it from commercial underwriters could result in
substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if it is available
at all.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, United maintains other
types of insurance such as property and casualty, directors and officers,
cargo, automobile and the like, with limits and deductibles that are standard
within the industry.&nbsp; Compared to insurance prior to September 11,
the premiums are substantially higher with lower limits.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Program.</i></b>&nbsp; In time of war or certain other national emergencies,
the U.S. government can require United and other major air carriers to
provide airlift services to the U.S. Military under the Civil Reserve Air
Fleet Program ("CRAF").&nbsp; On February 8, 2003, the U.S. government
activated CRAF (for only the second time since the program was established
in 1951) because the U.S. military's airlift needs exceeded the military's
capabilities in connection with the buildup of troops in the Middle East.&nbsp;
As a result, United, along with other U.S. commercial airlines, is currently
participating in the transportation of troops and cargo to the Middle East.&nbsp;
While United's participation in the CRAF program to date has had a positive
impact on United's profitability, should United be required to provide
a more substantial amount of these services for an extended period, its
business could be adversely impacted.
<p><b><u>Conflict With Iraq</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In anticipation of the U.S.
conflict with Iraq, United conducted extensive contingency preparations
and developed a plan to address the likely effects on the airline industry
as a whole and on United in particular.&nbsp; With the initiation of the
military campaign on March 19, 2003, United implemented that plan, which
included an immediate reduction in capacity of 8% effective April 6, 2003
and placing a number of employees on temporary unpaid leave.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, United has been
working with other carriers, major labor unions, and the Air Transport
Association, a trade association of major U.S. airlines, to develop and
propose a comprehensive government assistance package for the carriers.&nbsp;
Potential components could include relief from certain taxes, the payment
by the federal government of all costs for airport security, opening up
the Strategic Oil Reserve and government-provided terrorism insurance for
the airlines.&nbsp; At this time it is impossible to assess the prospects
of such legislation and there can be no assurance that Congress or the
President will approve this or any other relief for the industry.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, if other relief
is insufficient or is unavailable on a timely basis, the Company may seek
to implement additional, temporary wage reductions for all employees.
<p><b><u>Marketing Strategy</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United seeks to attract customers
and create customer preference for United by providing a comprehensive
network, an attractive frequent flyer program and enhanced and differentiated
product and service offerings.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Alliances.</i>&nbsp;</b>
United has entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances
with other airlines to provide its customers more choices and to participate
in markets worldwide that it does not serve directly.&nbsp; These collaborative
marketing arrangements typically include one or more of the following features:
joint frequent flyer participation; code sharing of flight operations (whereby
one carrier's flights can be marketed under the two-letter airline designator
code of another carrier); coordination of reservations, baggage handling
and flight schedules; and other resource-sharing activities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most significant of these
is the Star Alliance<font face="Symbol">&Ocirc;</font><font size=-2>, </font>a
global integrated airline network co-founded by United in 1997.&nbsp; As
of December 31, 2002, Star Alliance carriers served approximately 727 destinations
in approximately 125 countries with approximately 10,622 daily flights.&nbsp;
Current Star Alliance partners, in addition to United, are Air Canada,
Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Asiana, Austrian Airlines, bmi, Lauda
Air, Lufthansa, Mexicana, SAS, Singapore Airways, Thai International Airways,
Tyrolean and Varig.&nbsp; Two additional carriers are expected to join
in 2003: Spanair as of April 1 and LOT Polish Airlines as of October 26.&nbsp;
United currently holds bilateral antitrust immunity with Air Canada and
integrated antitrust immunity with Lufthansa, SAS and the Austrian Airlines
Group (which includes Austrian Airlines, Lauda Air and Tyrolean).&nbsp;
United has limited antitrust immunity with bmi subject to completion of
an "Open Skies" Agreement between the U.S. and U.K.&nbsp; For more information
on Open Skies and international rights, see "Government Regulation" in
this Item 1.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 2002, United announced
the development of a marketing partnership with US Airways to include joint
frequent flyer participation, joint lounge access and code sharing on certain
flights.&nbsp; Currently, United and US Airways have substantially implemented
the first two of those arrangements.&nbsp; The carriers currently code
share on selected flights and expect to complete the implementation of
the code sharing element of the partnership by the end of 2003, subject
to certain conditions imposed by the U.S. government.&nbsp; On August 11,
2002, US Airways and certain subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for
relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.&nbsp; That case is still
pending before the Bankruptcy Court. Although US Airways has filed a plan
of reorganization that has been approved by its creditors and confirmed
by the Bankruptcy Court and that provides for its emergence from bankruptcy
as a going concern, there can be no assurance that such plan will be implemented
successfully.&nbsp; If US Airways is unable to emerge as a going concern
or if it emerges as a significantly smaller or different company, the anticipated
benefits to United of the marketing partnership may never materialize and
United's business may suffer.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has also formed independent
marketing agreements with other air carriers, including Aloha, BWIA West
Indies Airways, Continental Connection (operated by Gulfstream), Great
Lakes Airlines (a regional carrier) and Spanair.&nbsp; United continually
evaluates the need for relationships with these and other carriers and
from time to time will change its independent marketing partners as conditions
warrant.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, United operates
the United Express<sup><font size=-2>&reg; </font></sup>marketing program
in North America, under which independent regional carriers serve small
and medium-sized cities and link them to United's mainline network.&nbsp;
United Express carriers are Air Wisconsin Airlines, Atlantic Coast Airlines
and Sky West Airlines.&nbsp; On February 27, 2003, United announced that
it had entered into an agreement with Mesa Air Group, Inc., pursuant to
which Mesa Air will become a United Express carrier on western routes.&nbsp;
As part of the Chapter 11 process, the Company is reevaluating each of
the contracts with the three existing United Express carriers and may renegotiate
or reject any of these agreements in connection with its reorganization.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Mileage Plus.</i></b>&nbsp;
The Mileage Plus frequent flyer program was established to develop passenger
loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers.&nbsp; More
than 40 million members have enrolled in Mileage Plus since it began in
1981.&nbsp; Mileage Plus members earn mileage credit for flights on United,
United Express, the Star Alliance carriers and certain other airlines that
participate in the program.&nbsp; Miles also can be earned by purchasing
the goods and services of non-airline program participants, such as hotels,
car rental companies, and credit card issuers.&nbsp; Mileage credits can
be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded travel and non-travel awards.&nbsp;
For a detailed description of the treatment of Mileage Plus awards, see
"Critical Accounting Policies" in <u>Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Distribution Channels.</i></b>&nbsp;
The overwhelming majority of United's airline inventory continues to be
distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global
distribution systems ("GDS").&nbsp; The U.S. Department of Transportation
("DOT") has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that could significantly
change the rules under which carriers deal with the GDS.&nbsp; These new
rules are expected to be finalized in January 2004.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United uses the Apollo reservation
system, which is hosted by Galileo International.&nbsp; The hosting agreement
with Galileo continues through 2004.
<p><b><u>Industry Conditions</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Operating Environment.</i></b>&nbsp;
The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.&nbsp; United's
operations can be adversely impacted by winter weather and United's first-
and fourth-quarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand.&nbsp;
Historically, operating results are better in the second and third quarters.&nbsp;
The events of September 11, 2001, and the recession in the U.S. economy
distorted the normal seasonal relationships in 2001 and 2002.&nbsp; As
a result of the U.S. war with Iraq, the typical seasonal fluctuations may
continue to be disrupted in 2003.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Competition.</i></b>&nbsp;
The airline industry is highly competitive.&nbsp; In domestic markets,
new and existing carriers are free to initiate service on any route.&nbsp;
United's domestic competitors include all of the other major U.S. airlines
as well as regional carriers, most of which have lower cost structures
than United.&nbsp; Recently, three of United's largest competitors, Delta
Airlines, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines, have given notice
of their intention to implement a comprehensive code sharing arrangement,
subject to certain regulatory approval.&nbsp; The successful introduction
of this arrangement, or of other comparable arrangements by other carriers,
likely will further intensify domestic competition.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its international service,
United competes not only with U.S. airlines, but also with foreign carriers.&nbsp;
United's competition on specified international routes is subject to varying
degrees of governmental regulations (see "Government Regulation").&nbsp;
United has advantages over foreign air carriers in the U.S. because of
its ability to generate U.S. origin-destination traffic from its integrated
domestic route systems, and because foreign carriers are prohibited by
U.S. law from carrying local passengers between two points in the U.S.&nbsp;
United experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries.&nbsp;
In addition, U.S. carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers
to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations
in air service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign
governments.&nbsp; To compensate for these structural limitations, U.S.
and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements
that allow the carriers to provide traffic feed to each other's flights.&nbsp;
See "Marketing Strategy - Alliances."
<p><b><u>Government Regulation</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Domestic Regulation.</i></b>&nbsp;
All carriers engaged in air transportation in the U.S. are subject to regulation
by the DOT.&nbsp; Among its responsibilities, the DOT has authority to
issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air
transportation, grant international route authorities, approve international
code share agreements, regulate methods of competition and enforce certain
consumer protection regulations, such as those dealing with advertising,
denied boarding compensation and baggage liability.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Airlines are also regulated
by the FAA, primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and
other safety and technical matters.&nbsp; The FAA has authority to issue
air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates,
prescribe maintenance procedures, and regulate pilot and other employee
training, among other responsibilities.&nbsp; The FAA also administers
the U.S. air-traffic control system.&nbsp; From time to time, the FAA issues
rules that require air carriers to take certain actions, such as the inspection
or modification of aircraft and other equipment, that may cause United
to incur substantial, unplanned expenses.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, the Company
is subject to inquiries by these and other U.S. and international regulatory
bodies.&nbsp; The Company does not believe that any such existing inquiries
will have a material effect on its business.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access to landing and take-off
rights, or "slots," at four U.S. airports historically has been subject
to government regulation.&nbsp; At these airports, O'Hare International
in Chicago, John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia in New York, and
Reagan National in Washington, D.C., the FAA has regulated the number of
available slots. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act
for the 21st Century, enacted in April of 2000, eliminated all slot restrictions
at O'Hare in July of 2002 and called for the elimination of slot restrictions
at Kennedy and LaGuardia by 2007. The eliminations to date have not had,
and the planned eliminations are not expected to have, a material effect
on the Company.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>International Regulation.</i></b>
Internationally, the Company is subject to the aviation authorities of
the foreign countries that United serves. These authorities may from time
to time impose regulations beyond those that apply to United's domestic
operations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, access to foreign
markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral treaties regulating
the number of points served, the number of carriers and the frequencies
of flights. More recently, the U.S. has pursued a policy of "Open Skies,"
under which the U.S. government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements
allowing unrestricted access to foreign markets. While a considerable number
of foreign governments have agreed to Open Skies, several major markets
remain subject to restrictive bilateral agreements. Among them are London
and Tokyo, where United has significant operations. Further, United's ability
to serve some countries and its expansion into certain others is limited
by the absence altogether of aviation agreements between the U.S. and the
relevant governments. Shifts in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies
can lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements between
the U.S. and other countries.&nbsp; These changes could diminish the value
of United's international route authority because changes in these agreements
could curtail or terminate United's international rights in the associated
markets.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2002, United
sought to expand its access to and presence in Asia.&nbsp; In response
to United's application for additional frequencies under newly negotiated
rights in the U.S.-Hong Kong bilateral agreement, the DOT awarded United
rights that will allow United to operate a second daily Hong Kong-Tokyo
flight.&nbsp; United also was awarded an additional code share frequency
to serve Vietnam, which brings the carrier's current pool of Vietnam code
share frequencies to eight.&nbsp; Although Vietnam holds significant commercial
potential, the absence of an air service treaty between the United States
and Vietnam prohibits U.S. carriers from serving this market directly.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air services agreement
between the U.S. and Japan provides an unlimited number of frequencies
to certain carriers, including United.&nbsp; United also holds significant
traffic rights from Japan to other locations within the Pacific.&nbsp;
These rights and the 2002 opening of Tokyo's Narita airport's second runway
provided United with the opportunity to add service in 2002 between Tokyo
and Taipei.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with
its international services, United is required to make regular filings
with the DOT and, in some cases, to observe rules establishing the tariffs
charged and service provided.&nbsp; In some cases, fares and schedules
also require the approval of the relevant foreign governments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The European Union (the "EU")
is taking an increasingly active role in regulating international aviation.
In October of 2002, the European Commission granted antitrust immunity,
subject to certain conditions, to United, Lufthansa and SAS.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November 2002, the European
Court of Justice issued a ruling that invalidated certain provisions of
aviation agreements between the U.S. and the EU.&nbsp; The governments
are committed to ensuring that this ruling does not interrupt existing
air service.&nbsp; This decision paves the way for the EU to negotiate
aviation treaties on behalf of EU Member States with other non-EU countries.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The European Commission continues
its attempts to modify the existing regulation that governs slots at EU
airports.&nbsp; The most recent proposal, if accepted, would have the effect
of favoring EU airlines and would dramatically alter the manner in which
EU slots are held and allocated. The proposed changes threaten to redefine
the issue of slot ownership and impede the selling and trading of slots.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in late 2001 and
continuing through March 24, 2002, airport authorities and other regulatory
bodies granted United and other international slot holders short-term waivers
from an international rule that ordinarily requires a carrier to forfeit
any slot that it uses less than 80% of the time in any season.&nbsp; Separately,
the DOT waived through March 31, 2002 its requirement that U.S. carriers
in limited-entry international markets return to the DOT frequencies in
those markets that they do not use more than 90 days. In light of the current
conflict with Iraq, United and other carriers are seeking comparable waivers
of the slot and frequency-of-use requirements from domestic and international
regulatory bodies and airport authorities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Legislation.</i></b>&nbsp;
The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the
"Stabilization Act") established the federal Air Transportation Stabilization
Board ("ATSB") and made $5 billion in federal grants and $10 billion in
loan guarantees conditionally available to the airline industry.&nbsp;
The legislation also provides relief from increased insurance premiums,
caps potential liability from the September 11 terrorist attacks, limits
liability for any future terrorist events and creates a federal compensation
fund for attack victims.&nbsp; In 2001 and 2002, United received $782 million
in grants. On June 24, 2002, UAL submitted an application to the ATSB for
a loan guarantee in connection with a contemplated financing.&nbsp; After
discussions with the ATSB and subsequent revision to the application, on
December 4, 2002, the ATSB informed the Company that it had not approved
the application.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the denial of the Company's application
for a pre-petition loan guaranty, UAL has been continuing to work with
the ATSB toward the possible funding of a loan that would provide financing
to the Company upon its exit from bankruptcy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate legislation enacted
in November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the "Aviation
Act"), has had wide-ranging effects on United's operations.&nbsp; The Aviation
Act makes the federal government responsible for virtually all aspects
of security that United has traditionally provided.&nbsp; The Aviation
Act created a new government agency, the TSA, responsible for aviation
security. Notably, the Aviation Act required that the security screener
workforce be composed entirely of federal employees by November 2002.&nbsp;
Regulations under the Aviation Act also require carriers to charge passengers
in the U.S. a security fee of $2.50 per enplanement, capped at $10.00 per
round trip and to remit that fee to the DOT.&nbsp; The DOT, as provided
in the Aviation Act, also has assessed an additional fee, equal to the
amount paid by carriers for security screening in the year 2000, directly
on air carriers to compensate for the costs of screening activities and
property.&nbsp; The Aviation Act mandates numerous additional security
measures, including that, as of December 31, 2002, all checked baggage
be screened by explosive detection systems.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Privacy Laws.</i> </b>An
initiative of significant impact within the EU and elsewhere is the introduction
of privacy standards that apply to companies transmitting private information
from the EU to non-EU countries.&nbsp; To comply with the privacy directives,
the U.S. Commerce Department and the EU have agreed to safe harbor principles.&nbsp;
Although the safe harbor principles are voluntary at this time, United
plans to comply with them.&nbsp; The U.S. Commerce Department and the EU
continue to review the status of voluntary compliance.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada, Argentina and Australia
have enacted new privacy laws covering the collection and disclosure of
personally identifiable information.&nbsp; These laws may have an impact
on the way United collects and transmits personally identifiable information
in these jurisdictions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Environmental Regulations.</i></b>&nbsp;
The Company, like others in the airline industry, is subject to federal,
state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning
emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe
drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils, and waste
materials.&nbsp; The Company and the industry are also subject to other
environmental laws and regulations, including those that require the Company
to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives.&nbsp; It is
the Company's policy to comply with all environmental laws and regulations,
which can require expenditures.&nbsp; The Company also conducts voluntary
remediation actions.&nbsp; These costs are not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known
as "Superfund") and similar environmental clean-up laws, waste generators
can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at
disposal sites that have been identified as requiring response actions.&nbsp;
The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party (by
a governmental unit or private party) at certain sites that could result
in future expenditures, including the Mattiace Petrochemical Superfund
Site, the Approved Oil Superfund Site, the Chemsol Inc. Superfund Site,
and the Gibson Environmental Inc. Superfund Site.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a dispute primarily
among United, American, and Ogden Services (as well as Northwest Airlines
and Delta) concerning the responsibility for payment of certain clean up
costs for groundwater and soil contamination near terminals 8 and 9 at
New York's JFK Airport.&nbsp; The parties' views on proper allocation of
the costs differ. This litigation, which was initiated in 2000 in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, is currently stayed because of the bankruptcy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Miami International Airport
has been conducting a long-term project to investigate and remediate soil
and groundwater contamination at the airport.&nbsp; Recently, the Miami
International Airport has identified a multitude of current and former
tenants it believes should help pay for these remedial measures, and United
is one of these tenants.&nbsp; While the airport initiated a lawsuit in
2001 against a handful of potentially responsible parties, United is not
one of the parties named in the lawsuit.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with a June
1999 order issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board
("CRWQCB"), United, along with most of the other tenants of the San Francisco
International Airport, has been investigating potential environmental contamination
at the airport and conducting remediation when needed.&nbsp; Among these
projects is an investigation and remediation project for solvent impacts
to soil and groundwater at the San Francisco Maintenance Center.&nbsp;
This project is being conducted in accordance with CRWQCB approvals.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August 2002, the Company
entered into a settlement with the U.S. EPA to address voluntarily disclosed
Clean Air Act violations associated with the requirement that low-sulfur
diesel fuel be used in certain ground support equipment.&nbsp; This settlement
involves a penalty payment and performance of a Supplemental Environmental
Project (involving the replacement of some older ground support equipment
with new electric-powered equipment).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. EPA and the State
of California are seeking penalties, and potentially injunctive relief,
from the Company for alleged non-compliance with hazardous waste generator
requirements at United's San Francisco Maintenance Center identified in
1999 and 2001.&nbsp; The Company has been working with both governmental
entities to resolve this matter.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the matters
discussed above, from time to time the Company becomes aware of potential
non-compliance with environmental regulations, which have either been identified
by the Company (through its internal environmental compliance auditing
program) or through a governmental entity.&nbsp; In some instances, these
matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial
proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions of $100,000
or more.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company does not expect
these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material adverse
effect on the Company.
<p><b><u>Employees - Labor Matters</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of March 1, 2003, the
Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 72,000 employees, of which
approximately 80% are represented by various labor organizations.&nbsp;
This number represents a significant reduction from the end of 2001, when
the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 84,000 employees.&nbsp;
This reduction was a direct response to the continuing adverse impact on
air travel resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, reduced
demand for air travel in general, as well as United's concerted efforts
to reduce costs.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The employee groups, number
of employees, labor organization and current contract status for each of
United's collective bargaining groups, as of February 28, 2003, were as

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collective bargaining agreements
("CBAs") are negotiated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor
relations in the transportation industry, and typically do not contain
an expiration date.&nbsp; Instead, they specify an amendable date, upon
which the contract is considered "open for amendment."&nbsp; Prior to the
amendable date, neither party is required to agree to modifications to
the bargaining agreement.&nbsp; Nevertheless, nothing prevents the parties
from agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the agreement in advance
of the amendable date. Contracts remain in effect while new agreements
are negotiated.&nbsp; During the negotiating period, both the Company and
the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo.
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>In order to
meet the earnings covenant under the DIP Financing, United needed to obtain
substantial labor savings from its employees by mid-February 2003. Therefore,
the Company imposed immediate wage reductions on its management and salaried
employees, including officers in December 2002. Additionally, United immediately
began negotiations with all of its unions in early December regarding the
changes to the Company's CBAs necessary to satisfy United's short-term
and long-term financial and business imperatives.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event the parties
cannot reach consensual modifications, Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code permits the Company to move to reject its CBAs. Under Section 1113(c),
the Company must satisfy several statutorily prescribed substantive and
procedural prerequisites before the Bankruptcy Court will authorize the
Company to reject its CBAs. In order to meet the deadline imposed by the
DIP Financing covenants for reducing its labor costs, United had been prepared
to file a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code by December 26, 2002, if consensual CBA modifications could
not be reached before that date.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the December 26 deadline
neared, however, United and several of its unions agreed to consensual
interim wage relief from its unions that would allow United and its unions
more time to continue negotiations to reach agreements on the CBA modifications
necessary for United to reorganize successfully while still meeting the
short-term financial imperatives established by the DIP covenants. United
reached agreements with four of its five unions to reduce wages on an interim
basis, effective January 1, 2003 to April 30, 2003. The leadership of the
IAM rejected the Company's proposal and therefore, on December 27, 2002,
United filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to impose a wage reduction
for the IAM-represented employees. On January 10, 2003, the Bankruptcy
Court granted the Company's motion.
<p>_______________________
<br><font size=-1><sup>1</sup>&nbsp; The collective bargaining agreement
between the Company and the AFA provides for negotiated mid-term wage adjustments.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the terms of the interim
agreements with its unions, and the relief granted by the Bankruptcy Court
against the IAM, United agreed not to file a motion to reject its CBAs
pursuant to Section 1113(c) before March 15, 2003. In the meantime, United
and its unions continued negotiations. The Company's DIP covenants, however,
still require United to obtain all of the relief sought in its proposed
CBA modifications by May 1, 2003. As a result, on March 17, 2003, United
filed a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) and the Bankruptcy
Court has scheduled hearings on this motion for April 14. March 17 was
the deadline by which such a motion needed to be filed to ensure that the
Company could obtain a ruling on its motion by early May 2003 and stay
in compliance with its DIP Financing covenants.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 26, 2003,
the Company reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association,
International ("ALPA") on a restructured CBA. The agreement, which will
become effective May 1, 2003, if ratified by the pilot membership, has
a 6-year duration and would reduce pay and benefits, and improve productivity
(through work rule changes), by an average of approximately $1.1 billion
per year versus the current contract.&nbsp; As part of these changes, retirement
and medical benefits for pilots would be reduced through a decrease in
the Company's contribution to the pilot defined contribution plan, a reduction
in the formula for their defined benefit plan, and changes to the medical
plan including increases to co-payments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tentative agreement
includes a success-sharing program that provides the opportunity for annual
pay-outs tied to the Company's level of profitability and performance.&nbsp;
The tentative agreement provides for significantly enhanced flexibility
with respect to regional jets, code share arrangements and a low-cost offering.&nbsp;
Finally, the Company has agreed to include in its plan of reorganization
provisions that pilots would receive a distribution of the equity, securities
or other consideration provided to the general unsecured creditors.&nbsp;
Additionally, the Company had agreed that any plan of reorganization it
proposes or supports will provide the pilot group with a distribution of
the above-described equity, securities or other consideration (as compared
to the total distribution provided to all employee groups) which matches
the proportion of pilots' contribution to total employee cost reductions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pilot contribution
in the tentative agreement represents a significant portion of the overall
labor cost reductions sought by the Company.&nbsp; Should the Company be
unable to obtain labor cost reductions from any of its union groups (through
consensual agreements or otherwise) which fall below the relief the Company
has articulates as necessary from that group, the Company has agreed to
proportionately reduce ALPA's approximate $1.1 billion contribution.

in <u>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations</u>.
<p><b><u>Corporate Governance and the ESOPs; Sunset</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 1994, the stockholders
of UAL approved a plan of recapitalization that provided an approximately
55% equity and voting interest in UAL to certain employees of United, in
exchange for wage concessions and work-rule changes.&nbsp; The employees'
equity interest was allocated to individual employee accounts through the
year 2000 under the Employee Stock Ownership Plans ("ESOPs") created as
part of the recapitalization.&nbsp; The entire ESOP voting interest is
voted by the ESOP trustee at the direction of, and on behalf of, the employees
participating in the ESOPs through Voting Preferred Stock. For further
background information and a description of the ESOPs see Note 16, "ESOP
Preferred Stock" and Note 19, "Employee Stock Ownership Plans" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the recapitalization,
the Company's stockholders approved an elaborate governance structure,
which was contained principally in the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation ("UAL Charter") and the ESOPs.&nbsp; Among other matters,
the UAL Charter provided that the Company's Board of Directors was to consist
of five public directors, four independent directors and three employee
directors appointed by different classes of stockholders.&nbsp; A number
of special stockholder, Board and Board Committee voting requirements were
also established which included special Board voting requirements on Extraordinary
Matters (e.g. specified business transaction outside the ordinary course
of business; significant asset dispositions; and most issuances of equity
securities), amendments to the UAL Charter and specified bylaws, repurchases
of common stock, stock sales to employee benefit plans, and business transactions
with labor.
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Under the terms of
the UAL Charter, these special governance provisions, except as set forth
below, expired or "Sunset" in all relevant respects on March 7, 2003, when
the (a) common shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding Class 1 and
Class 2 ESOP convertible preferred stock, plus (b) Common Equity (generally
common stock issued or issuable as of July 1995) and common stock held
in the ESOP and any other employee benefit plans sponsored by UAL or any
of its subsidiaries for the benefit of employees, represented, in the aggregate,
less than 20% of Common Equity.&nbsp; For purposes of measuring the Sunset,
employee ownership was 33.37% at December 31, 2002 and 19.21% on March
7, 2003.&nbsp; After Sunset, Class P Voting Preferred Stock, Class M Voting
Preferred Stock and Class S Voting Preferred Stock represent the right
to cast in the aggregate the number of votes that is equal to 46.23%, 37.13%
and 16.64%, respectively, of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of ESOP Preferred Stock outstanding or issuable under the
Supplemental ESOP. The following provisions relating to the Board of Directors
are in effect following Sunset: the three employee directors (representing
ALPA, IAM and salaried and management employees) continue to serve on the
Board; the Board size remains at 12 directors; the Outstanding Public Director
Nominating Committee has the responsibility to nominate up to nine directors;
and the two union directors serve on the Executive Committee and on any
other committees with responsibilities substantially the same as to those
of any committee on which the union directors were serving immediately
prior to Sunset.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section is intended as a general
summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the UAL Charter.

bankruptcy reorganization under Chapter 11, United is reassessing its fleet
requirements and is seeking to reduce significantly its aircraft financing
costs. Central to this undertaking is the Company's effort to readjust
lease and mortgage payments for aircraft whose fair market values have
fallen since the execution of the original agreements.&nbsp; United is
negotiating with a significant number of its aircraft lenders and lessors
to restructure the underlying financings to reflect current market rates.&nbsp;
Although the Company has reached agreements in principle with respect to
a number of aircraft, there can be no assurance that those tentative arrangements
will be successfully converted to final contracts, or that other comparable
arrangements will be available to the Company.&nbsp; To the extent United
is unable to reach final agreements at economically attractive terms for
the requisite number of aircraft, its financial and operational performance
may be adversely affected.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the automatic stay lasts for only 60 days with respect
to Section 1110-eligible aircraft, engines and related equipment except
under two conditions. The debtor may extend the 60-day period by agreement
of the relevant financier, with court approval. Alternatively, the debtor
may agree to perform all of the obligations under the applicable financing
and cure any defaults thereunder as required by the Bankruptcy Code.&nbsp;
In the absence of either such arrangement, the financier may take possession
of the property and enforce any of its contractual rights or remedies to
sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such equipment.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 60-day period under Section
1110 in UAL's Chapter 11 Case expired on February 7, 2003.&nbsp; The Company
has reached agreements with a significant number of aircraft financiers
to extend the automatic stay, in exchange in certain instances for United's
agreement to make specified payments.&nbsp; United also has made elections
with respect to certain other aircraft to cure all existing defaults and
to pay the contract rates as required by the Bankruptcy Code. With respect
to certain aircraft, however, United neither negotiated an extension of
the automatic stay nor agreed to cure and resume payments.&nbsp; Accordingly,
the financiers of such aircraft may seek to repossess the property.&nbsp;
Although no such financiers have sought to repossess any United equipment,
and although the Company believes that market conditions for commercial
aircraft make repossession unlikely, there can be no assurance that UAL's
lenders and lessors will not repossess any of the applicable aircraft.&nbsp;
Any such repossessions could result in substantial disruptions to United's
operations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information on Section
1110, see Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</u>
<p><b><u>Ground Facilities</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has entered into various
leases relating to its use of airport landing areas, gates, hangar sites,
terminal buildings and other airport facilities in most of the municipalities
it serves.&nbsp; Major leases expire at San Francisco in 2003 and 2011,
Oakland in 2007, Washington-Dulles in 2014, Chicago O'Hare in 2018, Los
Angeles in 2021, Denver in 2025 and Indianapolis in 2031.&nbsp; United
intends to exercise its rights under the 2003 San Francisco lease by extending
the term until 2013 pursuant to a 10-year renewal option. United owns a
106-acre complex in suburban Chicago consisting of more than 1,000,000
square feet of office space for its world headquarters, a computer facility
and a training center.&nbsp; United also owns a flight training center,
located in the City and County of Denver, that can accommodate 36 flight
simulators and more than 90 computer-based training stations.&nbsp; Both
the Chicago and Denver facilities are fully mortgaged. United owns a limited
number of other properties, including a reservations facility and an office
building in Denver and a crew hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii; all of these facilities
are fully mortgaged.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United's Maintenance Operation
Center at San Francisco International Airport occupies 129 acres of land,
3,000,000 square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar docks under
a lease expiring in 2003, with an option to extend for 10 years.&nbsp;
United intends to exercise its rights under the lease agreement by extending
the term until 2013 pursuant to the renewal option. United's Indianapolis
Maintenance Center, a major aircraft maintenance and overhaul facility,
is operated under a lease with the Indianapolis Airport Authority that
expires in 2031.&nbsp; The Indianapolis Maintenance Center occupies 300
acres of land, 1,690,000 square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar
docks. United also leases a major facility at the Oakland, California airport,
dedicated to widebody airframe maintenance.&nbsp; The Oakland facility
occupies 44 acres of land, 380,000 square feet of floor space and has four
aircraft hangar docks.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United's off-airport leased
properties have included a number of ticketing, sales and general office
space in the downtown and outlying areas of most of the larger cities comprised
in the United system. As part of its restructuring and cost containment
efforts, United has closed, terminated or rejected all of its city ticket
office leases. United continues to lease and operate a number of general
office, reservations, sales and other support facilities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002, approximately
$1.7 billion in special facilities revenue bonds ("municipal bonds") originally
issued on behalf of United to build or improve airport-related facilities
were outstanding. The Company leases facilities at airports pursuant to
lease agreements where municipal bonds funded at least some of its airport-related
projects. Pursuant to the financing agreements entered into by United in
connection with such issuance of municipal bonds, the Company is required
to make payments in amounts sufficient to pay the interest semi-annually
with principal payable upon maturity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United is not permitted under
the Bankruptcy Code to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt without
providing notice to its creditors and receiving the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court. As United has been advised its municipal bonds are unsecured (or
in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt, United cannot
make payments thereon without first meeting the requirements outlined above.Accordingly,
the Company has classified all of its municipal bonds as liabilities subject
to compromise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code requires that the Company timely perform all of its post-petition
obligations under unexpired leases of non-residential real property. The
Company believes that it is in compliance with all payment obligations
under its lease agreements relating to those airports where it has municipal
bonds outstanding. Under certain of the airport lease agreements, however,
the Company may be considered in default due to the non-payment of the
debt and therefore subject to the default provisions of the lease agreements
with the airports. Possible consequences could include loss of the Company's
status as a signatory airline (resulting in increased rents and landing
fees) and loss of the Company's exclusive space agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company did not pay certain
rental and landing fees when first due on December 1, 2002 under its airport
use agreement with the City of Chicago with respect to the Chicago O'Hare
International Airport. By letter to the Company dated December 4, 2002,
Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago asserted that the Company may
have forfeited its exclusive rights to its premises at O'Hare on account
of the Company's non-payment of such rental and landing fees. By letter
to Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago on December 5, 2002, the
Company confirmed that it had paid, by wire transfer, on December 5, 2002,
the full payment of outstanding rental and landing fee obligations at O'Hare
and that such payment constituted a cure of any delinquency or default
and that the Company's rights under such lease remain unaffected. Likewise,
by letter to Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago on December 6,
2002, the Company reiterated its position that the December 5<sup>th</sup>
payment represented a cure of any rental delinquencies or defaults and
that the City's attempt to modify the Company's exclusive rights was ineffective.
A difference of opinion remains as to whether the City of Chicago's attempt
to change the exclusive nature of the premises at O'Hare has any legal
effect.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company did not make
the debt service payments due March 1, 2003 of approximately $3.2 million
on its Chicago O'Hare Series 1999A Bonds and of approximately $1.0 million
on its Miami-Dade Series 2000 Bonds. Additionally, the Company does not
intend to make debt service payments or any other payment due on or after
April 1, 2003 on any of the municipal bond issuances, which include those
referenced above, issued on behalf of the Company and relating to domestic
airport financings.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company filed a Complaint
Of Debtor For Declaratory Judgment with the Bankruptcy Court on February
28, 2003 and entered into a Standstill Agreement with the City of Chicago
to seek clarification of its obligations under the municipal bonds and
to protect its rights under its airport lease agreement at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport until the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits of
the complaint.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 21, 2003, the Company
filed other Complaints of Debtor for Declaratory Judgment and, in connection
therewith, corresponding Motions for Temporary Restraining Order with respect
to the municipal bonds issuances relating to the facilities at the Denver
International Airport, the New York City - John F. Kennedy International
Airport, the San Francisco International Airport, and the Los Angeles International
Airport, each seeking a clarification of the Company's obligations under
the applicable municipal bonds, and the protection of its rights under
its underlying airport lease agreements at the applicable airport until
the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits of each of the above complaints.
On March 27, the Bankruptcy Court conducted a hearing on this issue.&nbsp;
At that time, the Court continued the hearing until March 31, 2003 and
the parties are attempting to negotiate an order that would protect the
Company's rights under its leases by requiring the lessors to give additional
notice of certain alleged defaults.&nbsp; The Company is unable to predict
what, if any, action might be taken in the future by either the bondholders
or the airport authorities as a result of its failure to pay these obligations
as contractually required.

<p><b>ITEM 3.&nbsp; LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.</b>
<p><b><u>In re: UAL Corporation, et. al.</u></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>As discussed
above, on the Petition Date, the Company, United and 26 other direct and
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court.&nbsp;
The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption "In
re UAL Corporation, et al., Case Nos. 02-B-48191 through 02-B-48218."&nbsp;
As debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are authorized under Chapter 11 to
continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may not engage in transactions
outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the
Bankruptcy Court.&nbsp; As of the Petition Date, virtually all pending
litigation (including some of the actions described below) is stayed, and
absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject to certain
exceptions, may take any action, again subject to certain exceptions, to
recover on pre-petition claims against the Debtors.&nbsp; In addition,
Debtors may reject pre-petition executory contracts and unexpired lease
obligations, and parties affected by these rejections may file claims with
the Bankruptcy Court.&nbsp; At this time, it is not possible to predict
the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases or their effect on the Company's business.
<p><b><u>Summers v. UAL Corporation ESOP, et. al.</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UAL Corporation ESOP
and the ESOP Committee were sued on February 28, 2003, by certain ESOP
participants in a purported class action that alleges that the ESOP Committee
breached its fiduciary duty by not selling UAL stock held by the ESOP from
July 19, 2001 to the present. The complaint cites numerous events and disclosures
that allegedly should have alerted the Committee to the need to sell the
shares. The ESOP committee ultimately appointed State Street to act as
fiduciary, and State Street started selling the shares in September 2002
when the stock was trading between $1 and $5 per share. The Company has
$10 million in fiduciary insurance in place to cover some portion of any
liability and is obligated to indemnify the Committee members beyond that
coverage.
<p><b><u>Frank, et al. v. United; EEOC v. United</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A class action lawsuit against
United was filed on February 7, 1992 in federal district court in California,
alleging that United's former flight attendant weight program, in effect
from 1989 to 1994, unlawfully discriminated against flight attendants on
the grounds of sex, age and other factors, and seeking monetary relief.&nbsp;
On April 29, 1994, the class was certified as to the sex and age claims.
Following extensive motion practice, on March 10, 1998, the district court
dismissed all the claims against United.&nbsp; Following an appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a three-judge panel of the
Ninth Circuit, on June 21, 2000, overturned the ruling.&nbsp; The court
ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law
on their claims for discrimination based on sex and that a trial was required
for determination on their claims for age discrimination. In addition,
the appellate court reversed the dismissal of all individual class representative
claims of discrimination and the case was remanded to the district court
for further proceedings.&nbsp; United's petition before the U.S. Supreme
Court was rejected.&nbsp; Prior to United's Chapter 11 filing, the parties
settled the case to enable plaintiffs to establish the size of their unsecured
claim.&nbsp; The automatic stay resulting from United's Chapter 11 filing
will be lifted to allow the court to conduct proceedings to allow the finalization
of the settlement as to the class.
<p><b><u>Hall d.b.a. Travel Specialists v. United</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A North Carolina travel agent
filed an antitrust class action suit against United (and other carriers)
initially in state court and then in federal court in North Carolina following
the reduction by United (and other carriers) in November 1999 of commission
rates payable to travel agents. Plaintiffs allege that United and the other
carrier-defendants conspired to fix travel agent commissions in violation
of the Sherman Act and seek treble damages and injunctive relief. Subsequent
to this initial filing, the case has been expanded by the addition of five
new travel agencies, ARTA, and eight new carrier defendants, including
two Star Alliance carriers. In addition, the court has allowed the addition
of claims related to carriers' commission reduction actions in 1997, 1998,
2001, and 2002. Earlier this year the Court granted plaintiffs' motion
to certify the case as a class action consisting of all U.S. (and its possessions)
travel agencies. Plaintiffs have claimed lost commissions, assuming liability,
in the amount of approximately $13 billion, although United's alleged share
of this amount has not been determined by plaintiffs. Upon UAL's Chapter
11 filing, this case was stayed as against United. Since that date, all
remaining defendants have moved for summary judgment. Those motions are
pending before the court.&nbsp; Trial has been set for September 2, 2003.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the Hall case,
United has been named in several other cases filed in the U.S. and Canada,
involving commission rates payable to travel agencies. These cases are
in their early stages. United does not expect the outcome of Hall and the
related cases to have any material effect upon UAL's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
<p><b><u>Litigation Associated with September 11 Terrorism</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 40 lawsuits
have been served on United in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York related to the September 11 terrorist attacks.&nbsp;
The suits seek a variety of recoveries, including wrongful death, injury
or property damage, and claim that United and others breached their duty
of care to the passengers and to the ground victims.&nbsp; A number of
lawsuits have also been filed against American and other defendants.&nbsp;
Under federal law, United's liability on such claims will be limited to
the amount of United's insurance coverage.&nbsp; United anticipates the
filing of other lawsuits related to the September 11 attacks in the future.&nbsp;
Also, a forum was created under federal law to provide, as an alternative
to litigation, an administrative avenue for the payment of compensation
to victims of the terror attacks. United has stipulated that the automatic
stay applicable to these lawsuits under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code will be
lifted for 60 days to permit United's participation in a motion to dismiss
the claims of the ground victims.

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The Company has suspended
the payment of cash dividends on the Common Stock. No assurance can be
given as to when or whether the payment of dividends will resume.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rights and claims of

as to what values, if any, will be ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings

caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in
any of such securities and claims.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 28, 2003, based
on reports by the Company's transfer agent for the Common Stock, there
were 19,665 common stockholders of record.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continued listing on the
NYSE requires, among other things, compliance with certain quantitative
criteria established by the NYSE. One such requirement is that the stock
price remain, on average, at or above $1. On March 25, 2003, the Company
received notice from the NYSE that the Common Stock was "below criteria"
in this regard in that its average closing price for the preceding 30 consecutive
trading days was less than $1. The Company has determined that it cannot
affirm to the NYSE an intent to cure this deficiency within the prescribed
period of time and, as a result, the NYSE has initiated delisting procedures

<p><b><u>Chapter 11 Reorganization</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 9, 2002, the
Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, Eastern Division, in Chicago. For further details
regarding the bankruptcy filing, see "Bankruptcy Considerations" under
Item 1.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Petition Date, the
Bankruptcy Court gave interim approval for an aggregate of up to $1.5 billion
in DIP Financing. The DIP Financing is structured as a $300 million facility
from Bank One, NA (the "Bank One Facility") and a $1.2 billion facility
provided by a group led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank
One, NA and The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. (the "Club Facility").&nbsp;
The Company has received commitments of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility
following the completion of the syndication process for that facility;
the balance is conditioned upon the participation of one or more additional
lenders, subject to approval by the existing participants.&nbsp; The Company
currently has access to the entire Bank One Facility and to $500 million
of the Club Facility. Access to the balance of the Club Facility is subject
to specified terms of that facility.&nbsp; These terms require that the
Company achieve performance milestones under its business plan, which include
substantial cost savings in the near term.&nbsp; Final approval of the
DIP Financing was granted by the Bankruptcy Court on December 30, 2002.
For more information on the DIP Financing, see Note 1, "Proceedings Under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to successfully
exit Chapter 11, the Company will need to propose, and obtain confirmation
by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would resolve,
among other things, the Debtors' pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for
its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy. The timing
of filing a plan of reorganization by the Company will depend on the timing
and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases.
Although the Company expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides
for its emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance
at this time that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court, or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically stays
most actions against a debtor, including most actions to collect pre-petition
indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the debtor's estate.&nbsp;
Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition
liabilities are subject to settlement under the plan of reorganization.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtors' rights to possess and operate
certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related
equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional
sale contract are governed by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code ("Section
1110") that specifies different treatment. For further information on Section
1110 and its impact on the Company, see "Properties - Flight Equipment"
under Item 2 and Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject
certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real
property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the
Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions.&nbsp; In general, rejection
of an unexpired lease or executory contract is treated as a pre-petition
breach of the lease or contract in question. Subject to certain exceptions,
this rejection relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations
under that lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty
to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by the deemed
breach. Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code specified particular treatment
of collective bargaining agreements ("CBAs") which a debtor may move to
reject if the debtor first satisfies a number of statutorily prescribed
substantive and procedural prerequisites and obtains the Bankruptcy Court's
approval of the rejection. See "Employees - Labor Matters" under Item 1
and "Labor Agreements" below for further information.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, it is not possible
to predict accurately the effect of the Chapter 11 reorganization process
on the Company's business or when it may emerge from Chapter 11.&nbsp;
The Company's future results depend on the timely and successful confirmation
and implementation of a plan of reorganization. The rights and claims of
various creditors and security holders will be determined by the plan as
well.&nbsp; No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be
ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies,
and it is possible that UAL's equity or other securities will be restructured
in a manner that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value.
Accordingly, the Company urges that appropriate caution be exercised with
respect to existing and future investments in any of such securities and
claims.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 24, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court entered a preliminary injunction in order to restrict
the trading of the Company's common stock and debt interests in the Company.
The purpose of the preliminary injunction was to ensure that the Company
did not lose the benefit of its net operating loss ("NOL"). Under federal
and state income tax law, an NOL can be used to offset future taxable income,
and thus is an extremely valuable asset. However, a company can lose the
benefit of its NOLs if the company is deemed to undergo an "ownership change"
under certain very specific tax rules in the Internal Revenue Code. Excessive
trading in a company's stock (or debt when the company is in bankruptcy)
can trigger such an "ownership change," and thus the Company sought to
restrict the trading of the Company's common stock and debt interests.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the terms of the preliminary
injunction, no person can buy or sell UAL stock if that person holds more
than 4.8 million shares of UAL common stock or would hold more than 4.8
million shares after the purchase. Any person who holds more than $200
million in debt claims against UAL must register as a "substantial claimholder"
with UAL, and no person may acquire debt claims against UAL if the acquisition
of the claims would cause them to hold more than $200 million in such claims.
See Note 7, "Income Taxes" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with SOP 90-7 and
on a going-concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations,
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course
of business.&nbsp; However, as a result of the Debtors' Chapter 11 filing,
such realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities, without substantial
adjustments or changes in ownership, are subject to uncertainty.&nbsp;
While operating as debtors-in-possession under the protection of Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code and subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court
or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business, the Debtors
may sell or otherwise dispose of assets, or liquidate and settle liabilities,
for some amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial
statements.&nbsp; Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change
the amounts and classifications in the historical financial statements.
<p><b><u>Results of Operations</u></b>
<p><b>Summary of Results -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air travel business
is subject to seasonal fluctuations. United's operations are often adversely
impacted by winter weather and United's first- and fourth-quarter results
normally reflect reduced travel demand. Historically, operating results
are better in the second and third quarters. The events of September 11
and the downturn in the U.S. economy distorted the normal seasonal relationships
in 2001 and 2002. As a result of the U.S. war with Iraq, the typical seasonal
fluctuations may continue to be disrupted in 2003.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, the Company
experienced significant operational disruptions, as a result of labor-related
delays and cancellations, as well as weather and air traffic control limitations,
which adversely affected both revenue and expense performance. The Company
attempted to mitigate the impact of these operational difficulties by reducing
capacity, particularly in the domestic markets, where most of the problems
were concentrated. The Company estimated the revenue shortfall arising
from these disruptions and associated schedule reductions and cancellations
to be somewhere between $700 and $750 million for the year.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, beginning
in early 2001, the weakening U.S. economy had a significant impact on the
airline industry as corporations reduced their business travel budgets
and changed their travel behavior. During the first six months of 2001,
the industry began experiencing significant revenue declines as a result
of the decrease in business traffic, which impacted both unit revenues
and yields, particularly in the domestic markets. United's domestic passenger
revenue was down $728 million (12%) in the first six months of 2001 compared
to the same period in 2000, partially driven from a 4% domestic capacity
reduction and a 15% decline in business revenues. Domestic unit revenue
was down 8% from 2000. Domestic business revenue was down $631 million
(15%) in the first six months of 2001, driven by a 13% decline in volume
and a 2% decline in yield.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, there
has been a strong correlation between airline revenues and GDP and corporate
profitability. As corporate profitability dropped during this period, companies
reduced spending on travel. During this period, approximately 65% to 75%
of United's domestic revenues were derived from business travelers, which
resulted in United being disproportionately affected by this decline as
compared to some of United's competitors who rely less heavily on business
travelers.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 had a significant negative impact on passenger and cargo
demand for air travel. In a direct response to the adverse impact on air
travel as a result of the terrorist attacks, United reduced its capacity
by 23% based on system-wide available seat miles compared to levels prior
to September 11. This schedule reduction allowed for the early retirement
of the entire B727-200 and B737-200 fleets in 2001. Additionally, United
began the process of furloughing approximately 20,000 employees. During
the fourth quarter 2001, United restructured its aircraft delivery program
with both The Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie to defer deliveries of
new aircraft for 2002 and 2003 from the 67 originally planned to 24 aircraft.
United took delivery of 24 of an original 49 aircraft scheduled for the
year 2002 and will not take delivery of any of the 18 aircraft originally
scheduled for 2003. The remaining 43 aircraft have been deferred into 2004
and beyond. United's future schedule will vary as the Company reacts to
continuing changes in demand and yields, as well as normal factors such
as seasonality and fleet composition.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the Air
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the "Act")
enacted in response to the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government
made $5.0 billion in federal grants available to the airline industry.
The Company received a total of $782 million in grants under the Act. This
amount represents the Company's total allocation of grant money under the
Act and is recorded as non-operating income in the <u>Statements of Consolidated
Operations</u>. For further discussion of the impact of the attacks, the
Company's response and the Act on the Company's financial statements, see
Note 3, "Special Charges" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout 2002, the
Company continued to suffer from the weakened revenue environment resulting
from the events of September 11 and the weak U.S. economy. In early 2002,
year-over-year unit revenues had been improving each month from a 14% decline
in January to a 4% decline in May; however, unit revenue growth stalled
in the third and fourth quarters as demand continued to be weak and yields
declined. Industry revenues continue to remain below 1995 levels and United,
in particular, has experienced declines in domestic unit revenue that are
below industry levels. United's unit revenue for 2002 decreased 4% from
the prior year and yields have declined 8% year-over-year.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL's loss from operations
was $(2.8) billion in 2002, compared to $(3.8) billion in 2001. UAL's net
loss for 2002 was $(3.2) billion ($(53.55) per share), compared to $(2.1)
billion ($(39.90) per share) before the cumulative effect of an accounting
change in 2001.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2002 results include
a special charge of $149 million recorded in connection with the closing
of Avolar ($82 million) and severance related to furloughs ($67 million)
Additionally, the Company recorded a gain of $46 million on the sale of
its investment in Cendant Corporation and recognized $130 million in non-operating
income as compensation under the Act. During 2002, the Company also had
a 0% effective tax rate, as compared to recognizing a $1.2 billion tax
credit in 2001.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2001, United recorded
a special charge of $1.3 billion in operating expense and $49 million in
non-operating expense for amounts relating to the September 11 terrorist
attacks and the resulting impact on the Company's schedule and operations.
In addition, through December 31, United has recognized $652 million in
non-operating income as compensation under the Act.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also during 2001, UAL recognized
a special charge of $116 million for costs associated with a terminated
merger with US Airways Group, Inc., including a $50 million termination
fee. In addition, the Company recorded a gain of $261 million on the sale
of certain investments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the above special
charges and gains on sales are described more fully in Note 3, "Special
Charges," Note 7, "Income Taxes" and Note 8 "Investments" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p><b>2002 Compared with 2001</b> -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Operating Revenues.</i></b>
Operating revenues decreased $1.9 billion (12%) and United's revenue per
available seat mile (unit revenue) decreased 4% from 9.76 cents to 9.35
cents. Passenger revenues decreased $1.9 billion (14%) due to a 6% decrease
in revenue passenger miles and an 8% decrease in yield. United's available
seat miles across the system decreased 10% from 2001; however, passenger
load factor increased 2.7 points to 73.5%. The following analysis by market
is based on information reported to the DOT:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cargo revenues decreased
$31 million (4%) due primarily to a 5% decrease in cargo ton miles, as
cargo yields remained flat year over year. Other operating revenues increased
$95 million (6%) primarily due to increases in Mileage Plus third-party
revenues.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Operating Expenses.</i></b>
Operating expenses decreased $1.5 billion (8%) and United's cost per available
seat mile (unit cost) increased 0.8% from 11.24 cents to 11.33 cents, excluding
special charges. Salaries and related costs decreased $51 million (1%)
as the impact of furloughing employees was partially offset by contractually
driven salary and benefit enhancements as well as increases to pension
and postretirement expense. Aircraft fuel decreased $555 million (22%)
on a 14% decrease in consumption and a 10% decrease in fuel price. Purchased
services decreased $239 million (15%) primarily as a result of volume-driven
decreases in GDS (global distribution systems) and credit card discount
fees. Depreciation and amortization decreased $66 million (6%) primarily
due to retirements of older aircraft. Aircraft maintenance decreased $141
million (20%) due to retirements of older aircraft and a decrease in engine
and aircraft repair volumes as a result of reduced flying. Commissions
decreased $294 million (41%) as a result of United discontinuing paying
base commissions on all tickets purchased in the U.S. and Canada, effective
March 20, 2002, as well as a decrease in commissionable revenues. Other
operating expenses decreased $157 million (9%) due to decreases in crew
layover expenses and volume-driven food and beverage costs, offset by increased
costs for hull and liability insurance of approximately $100 million.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Other income (expense).</i></b>
Other non-operating expense amounted to $534 million in 2002 compared to
$450 million in 2001, excluding special charges, reorganization items,
gains on sales and the airline stabilization grant. Interest expense increased
$65 million (12%) due to new debt issuances and increased borrowing rates.
Interest capitalized decreased $54 million (68%) primarily as a result
of lower advance payments outstanding towards future aircraft purchases.
Interest income decreased $45 million (43%) due to lower investment balances
combined with lower interest rates. Miscellaneous, net decreased $64 million
(74%) primarily as a result of lower reserve requirements for legal and
environmental costs.
<p><b>2001 Compared with 2000 -</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Operating Revenues.&nbsp;</i></b>
Operating revenues decreased $3.2 billion (17%) and United's revenue per
available seat mile (unit revenue) decreased 11% from 11.02 cents to 9.76
cents. Passenger revenues decreased $3.1 billion (19%) due to an 8% decrease
in revenue passenger miles and an 11% decrease in yield. United's available
seat miles across the system decreased 6% from 2000 which, combined with
the decrease in revenue passenger miles, resulted in a decrease to passenger
load factor of 1.5 points to 70.8%. The following analysis by market is

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cargo revenues decreased
$227 million (24%) due to a 24% decrease in cargo ton miles largely as
a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as the discontinuation
of freighter operations in the fourth quarter 2000. Other operating revenues
grew $157 million (11%) primarily due to a $161 million increase in fuel
sales to third parties.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Operating Expenses.
</i></b>Operating
expenses decreased $78 million (0.4%) and United's cost per available seat
mile (unit cost) increased 6%, from 10.58 cents to 11.24 cents, excluding
special charges. Salaries and related costs increased $203 million (3%)
due to routine annual salary increases for non-contract employees, contractually-driven
increases for employees represented by ALPA and the estimated costs of
contracts with the IAM, which were partially offset by the reduction in
force implemented after September 11. Commissions decreased $315 million
(31%) as a result of a decrease in commissionable revenues and a change
to the commission structure implemented in August 2001, which reduced the
cap paid on commissions issued in the U.S. for domestic travel from $50
for a round-trip ticket ($25 for a one-way ticket) to $20 and $10, respectively.
Aircraft rent decreased $61 million (7%) as the retirement of older aircraft
reduced the number of aircraft under operating leases. Landing fees and
other rent increased $50 million (5%) primarily due to increased rates
at various airports. Depreciation and amortization increased $38 million
(4%) due to an increase in the number of owned aircraft. Cost of sales
increased $219 million (21%) primarily due to costs associated with fuel
sales to third parties.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Other income (expense).</i></b>
Other non-operating expense amounted to $450 million in 2001 compared to
$271 million in 2000, excluding special charges, gains on sales and the
airline stabilization grant. Interest expense increased $123 million (31%)
as a result of new debt issuances. Equity in losses of affiliates increased
$11 million (92%) primarily due to losses recorded for the Company's investment
in Orbitz.
<p><b><u>Liquidity and Capital Resources</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The matters described
in "Liquidity and Capital Resources," to the extent that they relate to
future events or expectations, may be significantly affected by the Chapter
11 Cases. Those proceedings will involve, or may result in, various restrictions
on the Company's activities, limitations on financing, the need to obtain
Bankruptcy Court and Creditor's Committee approval for various matters
and uncertainty as to relationships with vendors, suppliers, customers
and others with whom the Company may conduct or seek to conduct business.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, under the Bankruptcy
Code, most of a debtor's liabilities must be satisfied in full before the
debtor's stockholders can receive any distribution on account of such shares.
The rights and claims of the Company's various creditors and security holders
will be determined by any plan of reorganization filed by UAL.&nbsp; Further,
it is also likely that pre-petition unsecured claims against the Company
will be substantially impaired in connection with the Company's reorganization.
No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed in
the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies, and it is possible
that UAL's equity or other securities will be restructured in a manner
that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value.
<p><b>Liquidity -</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>UAL's total
of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted
cash (both short- and long-term), was $1.9 billion at December 31, 2002,
compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2001. Cash flows used in operations
amounted to $1.1 billion, including the receipt of $130 million in government
grant money.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Property additions,
including aircraft and aircraft spare parts, amounted to $887 million,
including $730 million of vendor-financed purchases. During 2002, United
took delivery of eight A319, twelve A320 and four B777 aircraft. All of
these aircraft were purchased. United also acquired one B757 and nine B737
aircraft off lease during the same period. Additionally, ten owned aircraft
were sold and then leased back under operating leases during the year.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financing activities
during 2002 included principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations
of $1.3 billion and $220 million, respectively. During 2002, United closed
on a $775 million private debt financing which refinanced certain aircraft
and raised approximately $250 million in additional cash. United also arranged
long-term financing for approximately $314 million in debt that had been
placed in interim financing facilities and refinanced $238 million in long-term
debt through a sale-leaseback transaction that raised approximately $72
million in additional cash. Additionally, United repaid $133 million in
receivables-backed short-term borrowings when certain banks supporting
the borrowing program declined to renew it. In December 2002, United borrowed
$700 million under the DIP Financing.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 2002, United
repaid $34 million to the State of Indiana, on behalf of the various parties
to the agreements, for failure to reach its capital targets in connection
with the construction of the Indianapolis Maintenance Center. In addition,
in December 2002, the Company paid $59 million in retroactive pay plus
accrued interest to IAM-represented employees.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2002, the Company
received approximately $580 million, net, in income tax refunds, part of
which was a result of changes in the tax laws. In addition, United paid
$290 million in federal transportation taxes that had been deferred under
the Act after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in 2002, the Company
received $137 million in proceeds from the sale of its Cendant Corporation
stock and $130 million in compensation under the Act. In the third quarter
of 2002, the Company received approximately $113 million in cash which
had been held in trust under a services agreement with Galileo International
(now Cendant Corporation).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of December 31,
2002, the Company had $578 million in restricted cash (including $116 million
in long-term restricted cash) on deposit with various state and local governments.
The cash largely represents security for worker compensation obligations
in states where United self-insures, security deposits for airport leases
and reserves with institutions which process the Company's sales. Prior
to 2002, United met many of these obligations through surety bonds or a
secured letter of credit facility; however, many of the bonds have been
cancelled and the letter of credit facility expired in August of 2002.
As a result, United has been and may, in the future, be required to post
additional collateral in the form of cash deposits to support these types
of obligations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United's liability insurance
for losses resulting from war perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and
other similar perils) was cancelled effective September 26, 2001. United
obtained replacement coverage, although it was charged significantly higher
premiums for this replacement coverage which was in a substantially reduced
amount for claims not involving aircraft passengers. Additionally, the
FAA began providing supplemental third-party war risk insurance coverage
to commercial carriers for renewable 60-day periods for levels of coverage
not available in the market, which United also obtained.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November 2002, Congress
passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which required the FAA to provide
third party, passenger and hull war risk insurance through August 31, 2003.
This insurance may be extended to December 31, 2003, subject to the federal
government's determination that such coverage is necessary to the national
interest. There can be no assurance, however, that the FAA insurance will
continue to be available. Should the FAA discontinue this coverage, obtaining
replacement insurance from commercial underwriters could result in substantially
higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if it is available at all.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United did not make
any cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan trusts for U.S.
based employees in 2001 or 2002. In lieu of making cash contributions,
the Company utilized a portion of its credit balance (the cumulative difference
between prior year minimum required contributions and actual contributions)
to meet the minimum required contribution. The Company has a remaining
credit balance that is available to be used in 2003; however, once the
credit balance is fully utilized, substantial contributions may be required.
The Company currently estimates, based on current market conditions and
benefit plans, that it could be required to contribute approximately $5.5
billion to its defined benefit pension plan trusts over the next few years.
However, future funding requirements are dependent upon factors such as
interest rate levels, funded status, regulatory requirements for funding
purposes and the level and timing of asset returns as compared with the
level and timing of expected benefit disbursements. In addition, the Company
is seeking to revise its pension plans, as discussed in "Labor Agreements"
below, which would also impact future funding requirements. As such, it
is not possible to be more specific with respect to required contributions
and actual future contributions may differ materially. As of December 31,
2002, United's defined benefit pension plans were in compliance with all
U.S. government funding requirements.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conjunction with
the ratification of the contracts for the IAM, the Company has provided
collateral consisting of certain real estate, flight simulators, ground
equipment and spare part assets to support the payment of approximately
$520 million in retroactive wages due under the contracts in eight quarterly
installments commencing December 2002. In December 2002, the Company made
the first payment required under the contract and is currently seeking
release of the additional collateral.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 30, 2002,
UAL announced that it was suspending the payment of dividends on its 12.25%
Series B preferred stock and extending the payment of the December 31 distribution
on its 13.25% Trust Originated Preferred Securities ("TOPrS") to March
31, 2003. As a result of its bankruptcy filing, UAL is no longer making
dividend payments on the Series B or paying distributions on the TOPrS.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with
UAL's announcement that it was suspending dividend and distribution payments,
Standard &amp; Poor's ("S&amp;P") downgraded UAL's Series B preferred stock
and TOPrS to D from CC. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, S&amp;P downgraded
United's senior unsecured debt to D. In August 2002, Moody's Investors
Service Inc. downgraded its credit ratings on United's senior unsecured
debt from Caa1 to Ca and its ratings on UAL's Series B preferred stock
and redeemable preferred securities from Ca to C. Downgrades of the Company's
credit ratings during 2002 have resulted in an increase of $2 million in
interest expense for the year.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002,
commitments for the purchase of property and equipment, principally aircraft,
approximated $1.6 billion, after deducting advance payments. Of this amount,
an estimated $0.1 billion is expected to be spent in 2003. For further
details, see Note 21, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p><b>Capital Commitments -</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The Company's business
is very capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to
fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. United has, in the
past, funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by
issuing debt, or by entering into capital or operating leases. Similarly,
the Company often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports
to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other similar facilities.
As can be seen in the table below, these operating lease commitments (which
are sometimes referred to as "off-balance sheet debt") are significant.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following is a summary of
the Company's material contractual cash obligations as of December 31,
2002:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the
bankruptcy filing, the Company is not permitted to make any payments on
its
pre-petition debt and therefore, the amounts have been excluded from the
above table. In addition, as discussed in Note 1, "Proceedings under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code" and Note 13, "Lease Obligations" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>, the Company may assume, assume
and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases pursuant
to the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, the Company anticipates that its lease
obligations as currently detailed in the above table will change significantly
in the future.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pension obligations as
of December 31, 2002 are based on the Company's current pension assumptions
and current labor contracts. Thus, they assume no permanent wage concessions
are achieved, nor any changes to the Company's pension benefit plans are
implemented and that no waivers have been obtained from the government
to spread the minimum cash contributions for pensions over a longer period.
If these changes are effected in the future, the Company's pension funding
obligations could be reduced by approximately $1.9 billion over this same
period.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See Note 12, "Long-Term Debt,"
Note 13, "Lease Obligations," Note 20, "Pension and Postretirement Plans"
and Note 21, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties" in
the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u> for additional discussion
of these items.
<p><b>Capital Resources -</b>
<br><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DIP Financing.
</i></b>The
DIP Financing consists of two facilities, the Bank One Facility for $300
million and the Club Facility for $1.2 billion. The Company has received
commitments of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility following the completion
of the syndication process for that facility; the balance is conditioned
upon the participation of one or more additional lenders, subject to approval
by the existing participants.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bank One Facility
consists of a $300 million term loan with an interest rate option of the
prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%). As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $300 million at the LIBOR
option which is due in five equal monthly installments beginning in March
2004.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Club Facility consists
of a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of $800 million and
a term loan of $400 million, which matures on July 1, 2004. The Company
has the option of borrowing under the Club Facility at an interest rate
of the prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%).
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $400 million under the
term loan at the LIBOR option. In addition, the Company had available a
$100 million letter of credit facility that was drawn down in March 2003.
The remaining $700 million under the revolving credit facility is subject
to stringent availability hurdles as discussed below.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terms of the DIP
Financing include covenants that require the Company to satisfy monthly
ongoing financial requirements as determined by EBITDAR (earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rents)
and covenants that limit, among other things, the Debtors' ability to borrow
additional money, make capital expenditures and make additional corporate
investments. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a minimum
unrestricted cash balance, excluding escrowed amounts, of $300 million.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Club Facility,
borrowing availability is determined by a formula based on a percentage
of eligible assets. The eligible assets consist of certain previously unencumbered
aircraft, spare engines, spare parts inventory, certain flight simulators
and quick engine change kits. The underlying value of such assets may fluctuate
periodically due to prevailing market conditions and fluctuations in value
may have an impact on the borrowing availability under the Club Facility.
Availability may be further limited by additional reserves imposed by the
banks in their commercially reasonable discretion.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining $700
million of availability under the Club Facility, subject to the limitation
on borrowing availability discussed above, will be available to the Company
after certain conditions are met, including achieving positive cumulative
EBITDAR; submitting a certified updated business plan; providing updated
appraisals on the collateral and ascertaining there has been no material
adverse change with respect to transferability of routes, gate leaseholds
or slots.
<p><b><u>Other Information</u></b>
<p><b>Plan for Transformation -</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>During the
first quarter of 2003, the Company presented to its Board of Directors
and employees information regarding the plan for transformation (the "Plan"),
which outlines the fundamental changes to United's strategic direction.
The Plan, which the Company is working to refine through further collaboration
with its employee and creditor constituencies, seeks to develop a durable
and sustainable business model that will lay the foundation for a company
that is successful and competitive for the long run.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Core objectives of
the Plan are the reduction of United's labor and non-labor costs and the
development of a more comprehensive and compelling portfolio of products.
The Plan is intended to leverage United's strengths, including its industry-leading
global route network, substantial, well-situated hubs and large and loyal
customer base, including its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program. Key operational
elements of the plan include: (1) the preservation and enhancement of United's
extensive mainline service targeted primarily at the business traveler;
(2) the creation of a low-cost offering to compete directly with low-cost
carriers for leisure and price-sensitive travelers; (3) the growth of the
Company's United Express regional operations and (4) the expansion of United's
domestic and international alliances.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Plan, the
Company must:
<ul>
<li>
reduce costs and develop a business model that builds credibility with
the financial and investment community to ensure that United has access
to capital to emerge from Chapter 11;</li>

<li>
create clear and compelling value for customers;</li>

<li>
maintain and build on United's strong global network by creating a competitive
portfolio of products that allows United to continue to serve our core
business customer, yet offers additional value to cost-conscious fliers
and addresses the threat from low-cost carriers; and</li>

<li>
deliver value to employees in a fundamentally changed industry environment.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has already began
making cost reductions through a comprehensive restructuring program that
includes:
<ul>
<li>
reducing union labor costs through interim wage reductions as discussed
below in "Labor Agreements;"</li>

<li>
reducing salaried and management costs by $250 million in 2003 through
wage reductions implemented in December 2002, headcount reductions effective
January 2003 and proposed benefit changes;</li>

<li>
identifying business transformation initiatives that involve strategic
projects, such as the US Airways code share, and a systematic cost reduction
program to increase revenues and lower costs by over $1 billion in 2003
and $1.4 billion in 2004;</li>

<li>
renegotiating aircraft lease and mortgage agreements for approximately
$500 million in estimated savings by 2005; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
reducing capacity by 6% in 2003 and closing all U.S. city ticket offices
and certain reservation call centers</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, in 2003,
the Company has implemented an additional across-the-board reduction to
cut costs by targeting such areas as overhead staffing, food and beverage
costs and technology spending. The Company has also begun a "best practices"
program designed to examine every area of the Company and implement more
efficient practices. This program is expected to result in an additional
$400 million in cost reductions by 2005.
<p><b>Labor Agreements -</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>In order to
meet the EBITDAR covenant under the DIP Financing, United needed to obtain
substantial labor savings from its employees by mid-February 2003. Therefore,
the Company imposed immediate wage reductions of between 3% and 11% on
its management and salaried employees, including officers in December 2002.
Additionally, United immediately began negotiations with all of its unions
in early December regarding the changes to the Company's CBAs necessary
to satisfy United's short-term and long-term financial and business imperatives.
The Company's proposed changes to its CBAs involve targeted cost savings
of $2.56 billion annually on a cash basis compared to the current contractual
path. These cost savings are expected to be realized through wage rate
reductions, work rule modifications and reduced benefit levels.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event the parties
cannot reach consensual modifications, Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code permits the Company to move to reject its CBAs. Under Section 1113(c),
the Company must satisfy several statutorily prescribed substantive and
procedural prerequisites before the Bankruptcy Court will authorize the
Company to reject its CBAs. In order to meet the deadline for reducing
its labor costs and avoid being in default under the terms of the DIP Financing,
United had been prepared to file a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to
Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code by December 26, 2002, if consensual
CBA modifications could not be reached before that date.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the December 26
deadline neared, however, United and several of its unions agreed to consensual
interim wage relief from its unions that would allow United and its unions
more time to continue negotiations to reach agreements on the CBA modifications
necessary for United to successfully reorganize while still meeting the
short-term financial imperatives established by the DIP covenants in the
meantime. United reached agreements with four of its five unions to reduce
wages on an interim basis, effective January 1, 2003 to April 30, 2003,
resulting in a reduction to wages for ALPA-represented employees of 29%,
AFA-represented employees of 9% and PAFCA and TWU-represented employees
of 13%. The leadership of the IAM rejected the Company's proposal and therefore,
on December 27, 2002, United filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to
impose a 13% wage reduction for the IAM-represented employees. On January
10, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Company's motion and the Company
effectively reduced IAM-represented employee wages by 13% (14% from wages
earned after January 10, 2003). These wage reductions, combined with the
wage reductions for the Company's salaried and management employees, are
expected to result in cost savings of approximately $70 million per month
through April 2003.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the terms of
the interim agreements with its unions, and the relief granted by the Bankruptcy
Court against the IAM, United agreed not to file a motion to reject its
CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) before March 15, 2003. In the meantime,
United and its unions continued negotiations. The Company's DIP covenants,
however, still require United to obtain all of the relief sought in its
proposed CBA modifications by May 1, 2003. As a result, on March 17, 2003,
United
filed a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) and the Bankruptcy
Court has scheduled hearings on this motions for April 14. March 17 was
the deadline by which such a motion needed to be filed to ensure that the
Company could obtain a ruling on its motion by early May 2003 and stay
in compliance with its DIP Financing covenants. Without the full relief
sought by United's proposed CBA modifications becoming effective by early
May, the Company would be unable to meet its covenants, entitling its DIP
lenders to foreclose on substantial assets United needs to operate its
business.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 26, 2003,
the Company reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association
on a restructured CBA. The agreement, which will become effective May 1,
2003, if ratified by the pilot membership, has a 6-year duration, includes
provisions for a 30% pay cut (with1.5% increases on May 1, 2006, 2007,
2008 and April 30, 2009) and common pay rates for three groupings of aircraft:
B747-400 and B777 (paid at the B777 rate), B767 and B757 (paid at a blended
rate), and A319/320 and B737 300/500 (paid at the B737 rate). The pilot
defined benefit plan multiplier is reduced to 1.35 and the participation
credit is capped at 30 years. The Company's contribution to the pilot defined
contribution plan is reduced from 11% to 9%. Pilot health benefits will
be adjusted to incorporate mainstream benefit provisions and form the basis
for a common plan among all employees with a 20% co-pay.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The agreement provides
for flexibility with respect to regional jets, domestic and international
code share, cargo, and targeted low-cost operations. The contract no longer
contains a prohibition on furlough or a requirement to maintain a minimum
fleet or level of pilot staffing. Instead, the agreement provides for the
establishment of a single block hours commitment at the time of emergence
from bankruptcy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a part of the restructured
CBA, United pilots will participate in a two-part success-sharing program
including an annual incentive plan that aligns the interests of management
and other employees and a pre-tax profit-sharing plan that recognizes the
pilots' level of participation in the overall restructuring. In addition,
the pilot group will have a representative on the UAL board of directors
with ordinary voting power. The pilots additionally will receive equity
securities or other consideration under the plan of reorganization that
fairly reflects the value of the pilot contribution to the reorganization
of the Company.
<p><b>US Airways Code Share -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 24, 2002,
the Company announced a code share agreement with US Airways. The agreement,
which is expected to generate more than $200 million in annual revenue
for United, would allow both carriers to market service on each other's
network, providing significant consumer benefits and bringing new revenue
and customers to their route networks.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United and US Airways
customers have access to each carriers' airport clubs and they are able
to earn and redeem miles on each carriers' frequent flyer program. Additionally,
beginning January 28, 2003, the two carriers began to code share on selected
flights and expect to complete implementation of the code sharing arrangement
by the end of 2003.
<p><b>Foreign Operations -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United generates revenues
and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies. These expenses include
aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel expense, advertising
and distribution costs, customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact operating income through
changes in foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses.
Despite the adverse (favorable) effects a strengthening (weakening) foreign
currency may have on U.S. originating traffic, a strengthening (weakening)
of foreign currencies tends to increase (decrease) reported revenue and
operating income because United's foreign currency-denominated operating
revenue generally exceeds its foreign currency-denominated operating expense
for each currency.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a worldwide network
and significant sales and marketing efforts in the U.S. as well as every
major economic region in the world, United is able to mitigate its exposure
to fluctuations in any single foreign currency. The Company's biggest net
exposures are typically for British pound, Hong Kong dollar, euro and Japanese
yen. The table below sets forth the Company's exposure to various currencies
in 2002:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce the impact of exchange
rate fluctuations on United's financial results, the Company may hedge
some of the risk of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future
foreign currency revenues by purchasing put options (consisting of Japanese
yen, euro, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds) and
selling Hong Kong dollar forwards. To reduce hedging costs, the Company
sells a correlation option in the first five currencies referred to above.
United also attempts to reduce its exposure to transaction gains and losses
by converting excess local currencies generated to U.S. dollars on a timely
basis and by entering into currency forward or exchange contracts. As a
result of the bankruptcy filing, all swaps and forwards were terminated
by the respective counterparties and the Company's ability to enter into
new swaps or forwards may be limited in the future as a result of the bankruptcy
filing.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United's foreign operations
involve insignificant amounts of physical assets; however, the Company
does have sizable intangible assets related to acquisitions of Atlantic
and Latin America route authorities. Operating authorities in international
markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the U.S.
and foreign countries. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies
can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements
that could adversely impact the value of United's international route authority.
Significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact
on UAL's operating revenues and results of operations.
<p><b>Municipal Bonds</b> -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002,
approximately $1.7 billion in special facilities revenue bonds ("municipal
bonds") originally issued on behalf of United to build or improve airport-related
facilities were outstanding. The Company leases facilities at airports
pursuant to lease agreements where municipal bonds funded at least some
of its airport-related projects. Pursuant to the financing agreements entered
into by United in connection with such issuance of municipal bonds, the
Company is required to make payments in amounts sufficient to pay the interest
semi-annually with principal payable upon maturity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United is not permitted
under the Bankruptcy Code to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt
without providing notice to its creditors and receiving the approval of
the Bankruptcy Court. As United has been advised its municipal bonds are
unsecured (or in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt,
United cannot make payments thereon without first meeting the requirements
outlined above.<b> </b>Accordingly, the Company has classified all of its
municipal bonds as liabilities subject to compromise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code requires that the Company timely perform all of its post-petition
obligations under unexpired leases of non-residential real property. The
Company believes that it is in compliance with all payment obligations
under its lease agreements relating to those airports where it has municipal
bonds outstanding. Under certain of the airport lease agreements, however,
the Company may be considered in default due to the non-payment of the
debt and therefore subject to the default provisions of the lease agreements
with the airports. Possible consequences could include loss of the Company's
status as a signatory airline (resulting in increased rents and landing
fees) and loss of the Company's exclusive space agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company did
not make the debt service payments due March 1, 2003 of approximately $3.2
million on its Chicago O'Hare Series 1999A Bonds and of approximately $1.0
million on its Miami-Dade Series 2000 Bonds. Additionally, the Company
does not intend to make debt service payments or any other payment due
on or after April 1, 2003 on any of the municipal bond issuances, which
include those referenced above, issued on behalf of the Company and relating
to domestic airport financings.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company filed a
Complaint Of Debtor For Declaratory Judgment with the Bankruptcy Court
on February 28, 2003 and entered into a Standstill Agreement with the City
of Chicago to seek clarification of its obligations under the municipal
bonds and to protect its rights under its airport lease agreement at Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport until the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits
of the complaint.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 21, 2003, the Company
filed other Complaints of Debtor for Declaratory Judgment and, in connection
therewith, corresponding Motions for Temporary Restraining Order with respect
to the municipal bonds issuances relating to the facilities at the Denver
International Airport, the New York City - John F. Kennedy International
Airport, the San Francisco International Airport, and the Los Angeles International
Airport, each seeking a clarification of the Company's obligations under
the applicable municipal bonds, and the protection of its rights under
its underlying airport lease agreements at the applicable airport until
the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits of each of the above complaints.&nbsp;
On March 27, the Bankruptcy Court conducted a hearing on this issue.&nbsp;
At that time, the Court continued the hearing until March 31, 2003 and
the parties are attempting to negotiate an order that would protect the
Company's rights under its leases by requiring the lessors to give additional
notice of certain alleged defaults.&nbsp; The Company is unable to predict
what, if any, action might be taken in the future by either the bondholders
or the airport authorities as a result of its failure to pay these obligations
as contractually required.
<p><b>Airport Rents and Landing Fees -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United is charged facility
rents and/or landing fees at every airport at which it operates. In recent
years, many airports have increased or sought to increase rates charged
to airlines as a means of compensating for increased demands upon airport
revenues. Airlines have challenged certain of these increases through litigation
and, in some cases, have not been successful. However, to the extent the
limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge
such charges is restricted, the rates charged by airports may increase
substantially. Management cannot predict either the likelihood or the magnitude
of any such increase.
<p><b>Environmental and Legal Contingencies -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has been named as
a Potentially Responsible Party at certain Environmental Protection Agency
or State Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA or State EPA") cleanup sites
which have been designated as Superfund Sites. United's alleged proportionate
contributions at the sites are minimal; however, at sites where the EPA
or State EPA have commenced litigation or administrative proceedings, potential
liability is joint and several. Additionally, United has participated and
is participating in remediation actions at certain other sites, primarily
airports. The estimated cost of these actions is accrued when it is determined
that it is probable that United is liable. Environmental regulations and
remediation processes are subject to future change, and determining the
actual cost of remediation will require further investigation and additional
progress of the remediation. Therefore, the ultimate disposition cannot
be determined at this time. However, while such cost may vary from United's
current estimate, United believes the difference between its accrued reserve
and the ultimate liability will not be material.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL has certain other contingencies
resulting from the above environmental actions and other litigation and
claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes,
after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the
views of legal counsel, the nature of such contingencies and prior experience,
that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially
affect UAL's financial condition, operating results or liquidity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the
Chapter 11 Filing, as of the Petition Date, virtually all pending litigation
is stayed, and absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, no party,
subject to certain exceptions, may take any action, again subject to certain
exceptions, to recover on pre-petition claims against the Debtors.
<p><b>Sunset -</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>In connection
with the July 1994 recapitalization, certain employees of United were granted
an approximate 55% equity and voting interest in UAL in exchange for wage
concessions and work-rule changes. In addition, the Company's stockholders
approved an elaborate governance structure as described in Item 1. Business,
"Corporate Governance and the ESOPs." Under the recapitalization, the governance
structure remained in place and employees maintained 55% of the aggregate
voting power until "Sunset." Sunset occurred on March 7, 2003, resulting
in the elimination of the 55% voting power of the employees, among other
things. (See Note 16, "ESOP Preferred Stock" and Note 19, "Employee Stock
Ownership Plans" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>,
as well as Item 1. Business, "Corporate Governance and the ESOPs; Sunset.")
<p><b>Outstanding Income Tax Claims -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has income
tax refund claims ("Refund") against the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
of $126 million resulting from tax overpayments attributable to the six
years 1988 to 1993 as well as $262 million resulting from a 2002 net operating
loss that has been carried back to and generates a refund for taxes paid
in 1998 and 1999. However, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") had imposed
an "administrative freeze" that prohibited the IRS from remitting any of
the $388 million to the Company. The DOJ action was in response to the
Company's bankruptcy filing and was based on alleged claims of the U.S.
government that might be subject to setoff against the Refund. After discussions
with the DOJ, the Company reached an agreement with the government to lift
the freeze and permit the IRS to process and remit approximately $365 million
of the Refund. On March 27, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement
and the Company anticipates receiving the funds shortly.
<p><b>Critical Accounting Policies -</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Critical accounting
policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments
and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results
under different assumptions and conditions. UAL has prepared the accompanying
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting
policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Accounting for Long-Lived
Assets.</i></b> The Company has approximately $16 billion in operating
property and equipment at December 31, 2002. In addition to the original
cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy
elections made by the Company, including the estimation of useful lives,
residual values and in 2001, impairment charges.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company records
aircraft at acquisition cost, upon delivery. Depreciable life is determined
by using economic analysis, reviewing existing fleet plans, and comparing
estimated lives to other airlines operating similar fleets. Older generation
aircraft are assigned lives of 25 years which is consistent with the experience
of United and other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved, useful
life has increased. Thus, the Company has estimated the lives of "new generation"
aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on the Company's
historical experience with regards to the sale of both aircraft and spare
parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives
of the aircraft. Residual values are based on current dollars when the
aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not
reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual
values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the Company's fleet
plans and changes in conditions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company recognizes
an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted
future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is
the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair market value.
Typically, management estimates the undiscounted future cash flows for
its aircraft fleet with models used by the Company in making fleet and
scheduling decisions. These models utilize the Company's projections of
passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors for
the markets where the specific aircraft will operate.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2001, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of $517 million for the B737-500 and B747-400
aircraft fleets resulting from the anticipated decrease in future cash
flows in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of." (See Note 3, "Special Charges" in the <u>Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.) In the fourth quarter of 2002,
the Company evaluated its fleet in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Utilizing the Company's
current cash flow projections, based on the proposed CBA modifications
and other cost savings as discussed above in "Plan for Transformation"
and "Labor Agreements," and current appraisals of aircraft value, management
determined that no further impairment was necessary.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See Note 2(f), "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies - Operating Property and Equipment"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u> for additional
information regarding United's policies on accounting for long-lived assets.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Frequent Flyer Accounting.</i></b>
United's Mileage Plus frequent flyer program awards miles to passengers
who fly on United, United Express, the Star Alliance carriers and certain
other airlines that participate in the program. Additionally, United sells
mileage credits to participating airline partners in the Mileage Plus program
and ULS sells mileage credits to non-airline business partners. In either
case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on any airline that
participates in the program. The Company has an obligation to provide this
future travel; therefore, for awards to passengers redeeming on United,
United Express or one of the Mileage Plus partners, the Company recognizes
a liability and corresponding expense for this future obligation. For miles
sold to third parties, a portion of revenue from the sale of mileage is
deferred and recognized when the transportation is provided.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002,
United's estimated outstanding number of awards was approximately 10.5
million, as compared with 11.1 million at the end of the prior year. United
estimates approximately 8.6 million of these awards will ultimately be
redeemed and, accordingly, the Company has recorded a liability of $717
million, which includes the deferred revenue from the sale of miles to
program participants. The Company utilizes a number of estimates in accounting
for its Mileage Plus program that require management judgment.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may not reach
the threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not
always be redeemed for free travel. Therefore, the Company estimates how
many miles will never be used and excludes those miles from its estimate
of the liability. Based on historical data, the difference between the
awards expected to be redeemed and the total awards outstanding arises
because: (1) some awards will never be redeemed, (2) some will be redeemed
for non-travel benefits, and (3) some will be redeemed on partner carriers.
The Company also estimates the number of miles that will be used per award.
If actual miles used are more or less than estimated, the Company must
adjust its liability and corresponding expense.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a travel award
level is attained, the Company records a liability for the estimated incremental
costs of providing travel, based on expected redemptions. United's incremental
costs include the additional costs of providing service to the award recipient,
such as fuel, meals, insurance and ticketing costs, for what would otherwise
be a vacant seat.&nbsp; The incremental costs do not include any contribution
to overhead or profit.&nbsp; A change to these cost estimates could have
a significant impact on the Company's liability in the year of change as
well as in future years.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In each of 2002, 2001 and
2000, 2.0 million Mileage Plus travel awards were used on United.&nbsp;
This number represents the number of awards for which travel was actually
provided in 2002 and not the number of seats that were allocated to award
travel.&nbsp; These awards represented 7.8% of United's total revenue passenger
miles in 2002, 8.1% in 2001, and 7.2% in 2000.&nbsp; Passenger preference
for Saver awards, which have inventory controls, keeps displacement of
revenue passengers at a minimum.&nbsp; Total miles redeemed for travel
on United in 2002, including awards and upgrades, represented 59% of the
total miles redeemed, of which 70% were used for travel within the U.S.
and Canada.&nbsp; In addition to the awards issued for travel on United,
approximately 24% of the total miles redeemed in 2002 were used for travel
on partner airlines.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Company also
sells mileage credits to participating airline and non-airline partners,
a change to either the time period over which the credits are used or the
estimate of the number or fair value of tickets could have a significant
impact on the Company's revenues in the year of change as well as future
years. Additional information regarding the Mileage Plus frequent flyer
program is included in Note 2(g), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
- - Mileage Plus Awards" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Pension Benefits.</i></b>
The Company accounts for pension benefits using SFAS No. 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions" ("SFAS No. 87.") Under SFAS No. 87, pension expense
is recognized on an accrual basis over employees' approximate service periods
and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements.
Detailed information regarding the Company's pension plans are included
in Note 20, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements</u>. The Company's future funding requirements are
discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The calculation of
pension expense and pension obligations requires the use of a number of
assumptions, including the assumed discount rate and the expected return
on plan assets. The fair value of plan assets decreased from $7.6 billion
at December 31, 2001 to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2002. Lower investment
returns, higher benefit payments due to recent labor contract amendments
and declining discount rates have increased the difference between the
plans' fair value and accumulated benefit obligations from $1.3 billion
at December 31, 2001 to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2002.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company utilized
a discount rate of 6.75% at December 31, 2002, compared to 7.5% at December
31, 2001 and 7.75% at December 31, 2000. The discount rate is based on
the Moody's Aa bond index as of December 31, 2002, adjusted for the duration
of United's pension obligations. Duration is a commonly used measure of
interest rate risk that either assumes that yield changes do not change
the expected cash flows ("modified duration") or assumes that expected
cash flows may change given the fact that the yield changes ("effective
duration"). Since United's pension obligations are generally not satisfied
in a single lump sum distribution, management, with assistance from its
actuary, used the modified duration methodology to determine an acceptable
discount rate by matching the expected cash outflows of United's pension
obligations against available bonds with appropriate maturities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company assumed an expected
rate of return on plan assets of 9.0% at December 31, 2002 compared to
9.75% used at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The expected return on plan assets
is based on an evaluation of the historical behavior of the broad financial
markets and the Company's investment portfolio and taking into consideration
input from the plans' investment consultant and actuary regarding expected
long-term market conditions and investment management performance. The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation
of assets to the following fund types: 60% equities, 35% fixed income and
5% other with expected long-term rates of return of 11%, 6.5% and 13%,
respectively.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company believes
that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted
allocation and regularly reviews the actual asset allocation to periodically
rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate.
Pension expense is reduced by the expected return on plan assets, which
is measured by assuming the market-related value of plan assets increases
at the expected rate of return. The market-related value is a calculated
value that phases in differences between the expected rate of return and
the actual return over a period of five years.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actuarial gains or
losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ
from the original assumptions. Under SFAS No. 87, those gains and losses
are not required to be recognized currently as pension expense, but instead
may be deferred. If the unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the
greater of the projected benefit obligations and the market-related value
of plan assets, the amount outside the 10% corridor is subject to amortization
over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses of
$4.5 billion. The recognition of these losses is expected to increase pension
expense by approximately $75 million, $108 million and $157 million in
2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, the Company had unrecognized
prior service costs from past benefit improvements of $1.2 billion, which
will be amortized as a component of pension expense over the average remaining
service life of the covered active employees. The recognition of these
costs is expected to increase pension expense by approximately $91 million
in each of 2003, 2004 and 2005.
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valuation Allowance
for Deferred Tax Assets.</i></b> The Company initially recorded a tax valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2002.
In recording the valuation allowance, management considered whether it
was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would
be realized. This analysis included consideration of scheduled reversals
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carryback
potential and tax planning strategies, in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." At December 31, 2002, the Company had recorded
a tax valuation allowance of $1.2 billion against its deferred tax assets.
See also Note 7, "Income Taxes" in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements</u> for additional information.
<p><b>New Accounting Pronouncements -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 2002, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting
for Costs Associated with Disposal or Exit Activities" ("SFAS No. 146").
SFAS No. 146 requires that liabilities for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities be recognized when the liabilities are incurred, rather
than when an entity commits to an exit plan. The Company adopted SFAS No.
146 on January 1, 2003. The new rules will change the timing of liability
and expense recognition related to exit or disposal activities, but not
the ultimate amount of such expenses.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November 2002, the
FASB issued Interpretation 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others"
("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception
of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken
in issuing the guarantee. FIN 45 also expands the disclosures required
to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees
that it has issued. Initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN
45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified.
The disclosure requirements are effective immediately and are provided
in Note 21, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties" in
the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>. The Company does
not expect FIN 45 to have a material effect on its results of operations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 2003, the
FASB issued Interpretation 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
("FIN 46"). FIN 46 requires the consolidation of variable interest entities
("VIEs"), as defined. FIN 46 applies to VIEs created after January 31,
2003. The related disclosure requirements are effective immediately and
are provided in Note 21, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties"
in the <u>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</u>. The Company is
still evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on its financial statements.
<p><b>Outlook for 2003 -</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The threat of war
with Iraq and subsequent initiation of hostilities has resulted in a significant
decline in revenues for the first quarter and the immediate future. Passenger
unit revenue for January and February 2003 has declined 6% and 11%, respectively,
as compared to the same months of 2002 and future international bookings
in particular, have dropped significantly from the same period last year.
UAL currently expects to report an operating loss of approximately $900
million for the first quarter of 2003.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United's near-term
revenue forecast has deteriorated significantly from recent projections,
as the threat of war became a reality. In recent weeks, the Company has
experienced declines in fuel prices, but due to continued volatility in
the market place, is unable to predict what impact, if any, the war with
Iraq will have on fuel prices in the future. As fuel is a significant expense
to United, changes in fuel price could have a significant impact on the
Company's results of operations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the initiation
of military action between the U.S. and Iraq on March 19, the Company immediately
began the implementation of its contingency plan, which involved reducing
the schedule by an additional 8% effective April 6, 2003 and the implementation
of associated reductions in employment levels through placing a portion
of its employees on temporary unpaid leave.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company, in participation
with the ATA and other airlines, is in discussions with the U.S. government
regarding the need for financial relief for the industry. Although the
Company will continue to pursue relief from the government and other sources,
given the uncertain situation, further temporary reductions in employee
compensation may be necessary in the future.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's existing fuel
hedges were terminated December 9, 2002 by the counterparties, as the Company's
bankruptcy filing constituted an event of default under the contracts.
The terms of the DIP Financing limit United's ability to post collateral
in connection with fuel hedging. Notwithstanding the above, as market conditions
and its economic outlook change, the Company continually evaluates the
potential economic benefit of entering into fuel hedging arrangements.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain statements included
in the above "Outlook" paragraphs, as well as elsewhere throughout <u>Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</u>,
are forward-looking and thus reflect the Company's current expectations
and beliefs with respect to certain current and future events and financial
performance. Such forward-looking statements are and will be, as the case
may be, subject to many risks and uncertainties relating to the operations
and business environments of the Company that may cause actual results
to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in such
forward-looking statements. Factors that could significantly affect net
earnings, revenues, expenses, unit costs, fuel, load factor and capacity
include, without limitation, the following: the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern; the Company's ability to operate pursuant to the terms
of the DIP Financing; the Company's ability to obtain court approval with
respect to motions in the Chapter 11 proceeding prosecuted by it from time
to time; the Company's ability to develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate
one or more plans of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 cases;
risks associated with third parties seeking and obtaining court approval
to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for the Company to propose
and confirm one or more plans of reorganization, for the appointment of
a Chapter 11 trustee or to convert the cases to Chapter 7 cases; the Company's
ability to achieve necessary reductions in labor costs; the Company's ability
to obtain and maintain normal terms with vendors and service providers;
the Company's ability to maintain contracts that are critical to its operations;
the potential adverse impact of the Chapter 11 cases on the Company's liquidity
or results of operations; the costs and availability of financing; the
Company's ability to execute its business plan; the Company's ability to
attract, motivate and/or retain key employees; the Company's ability to
attract and retain customers; demand for transportation in the markets
in which the Company operates; general economic conditions; the effects
of the war in Iraq and any other hostilities or act of war (in the Middle
East or elsewhere) or any terrorist attack; the ability of other air carriers
with whom the Company has alliances or partnerships to provide the services
contemplated by the respective arrangements with such carriers; the costs
and availability of aircraft insurance; the costs of aviation fuel; the
costs associated with existing or future security measures and practices;
competitive pressures on pricing (particularly from lower-cost competitors);
government legislation and regulation; consumer perceptions of the Company's
products; weather conditions; and other risks and uncertainties set forth
from time to time in UAL's reports to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission. Consequently, the forward-looking statements should
not be regarded as representations or warranties by the Company that such
matters will be realized. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation
to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether in response
to new information, unforeseen events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Interest Rate Risk -</b>
United's exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates
relates primarily to its debt obligations and short-term investments. United
does not use derivative financial instruments in its investments portfolio.
United's policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of
fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements, depending
upon market conditions. A portion of the borrowings are denominated in
foreign currencies which exposes the Company to risks associated with changes
in foreign exchange rates. To hedge against some of this risk, the Company
has placed foreign currency deposits (primarily for Japanese yen and euros)
to meet foreign currency lease obligations designated in the respective
currencies. Since unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on the foreign
currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency
obligations, the Company reduces its overall exposure to foreign currency
exchange rate volatility. The fair value of these deposits is determined
based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap
rate. The fair value of long-term debt is based on the quoted market prices
for the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows
using a U.S. Treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument,
adjusted by a credit spread.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Foreign Currency Risk
- -</b> United has established a foreign currency hedging program using currency
forwards and options (purchasing put options and selling correlation options)
to hedge exposure to the Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar,
British pound, Australian dollar and the euro. The goal of the hedging
program is to effectively manage risk associated with fluctuations in the
value of the foreign currency, thereby making financial results more stable
and predictable. United does not use currency forwards or currency options
for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2002, United had no outstanding
currency hedges.

<p><b>ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</b>
<center>
<p><u>INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORTS</u></center>

<p>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
<br>UAL Corporation
<br>Elk Grove Township, Illinois
<p>We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial
position of UAL Corporation (Debtor-in-Possession) and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. Our audit
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item
15(a)2 for the year ended December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial
statements ("financial statements") and the financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audit. The financial statements of the Company and
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 for the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, before the change in composition
of its reportable segments and inclusion of disclosures as discussed in
Note 23 and Note 2(k), respectively, were audited by other auditors who
have ceased operations. Those auditors, expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements and financial statement schedule in their
report dated February 20, 2002, and included an explanatory paragraph that
described a change in accounting principle for the measurement of redeemable
preferred ESOP stock and change in accounting principles for revenue recognition.
<p>We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
<p>In our opinion, such 2002 financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of UAL Corporation (Debtor-in-Possession)
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in
our opinion, the 2002 financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic 2002 financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
<p>As discussed in Note 1, the Company has filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The accompanying financial
statements do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of
the bankruptcy proceedings. In particular, such financial statements do
not purport to show (a) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation
basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (b) as to prepetition
liabilities, the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies,
or the status and priority thereof; (c) as to stockholder accounts, the
effect of any changes that may be made in the capitalization of the Company;
or (d) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made in
its business.
<p>The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, as
a result of the bankruptcy filing, realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership,
are subject to uncertainty and raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plan concerning these
matters is also discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
<p>As discussed above, the financial statements as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were audited by other auditors who have
ceased operations. As described in Note 23, the Company changed the composition
of its reportable segments in 2002, and the amounts in the 2001 and 2000
financial statements relating to reportable segments have been restated
to conform to the 2002 composition of reportable segments. We audited the
adjustments that were applied to restate the disclosures for reportable
segments reflected in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements. Our procedures
included (i) comparing the adjusted amounts to the Company's underlying
records obtained from management, and (ii) testing the mathematical accuracy
of the reconciliations of segment amounts to the financial statements.
In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly
applied. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures
to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements of the Company other than with
respect to such adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion
or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000 financial statements
taken as a whole.
<p>As described in Note 2(k), these financial statements have been revised
to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which
was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit procedures
with respect to the disclosures in Note 2(k) with respect to 2001 and 2000
included (<i>a</i>) agreeing the previously reported net earnings (loss)
to the previously issued financial statements<font size=-1> </font>and
the adjustments to reported net earnings (loss) representing amortization
expense (including any related tax effects) recognized in those periods
related to intangible assets that are no longer being amortized<b> </b>to
the Company's underlying records obtained from management, and (<i>b</i>)
testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net
earnings (loss) to reported net earnings (loss), and the related earnings
(loss) per share amounts. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 and
2000 in Note 2(k) are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit,
review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements
of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly,
we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001
and 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.

<p>Chicago, Illinois
<br>March 20, 2003
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>To the Stockholders and
<br>Board of Directors, UAL Corporation:
<p>We have audited the accompanying statements of consolidated financial
position of UAL Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiary companies
as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements of consolidated
operations, consolidated cash flows and consolidated stockholders' equity
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These
financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
<p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UAL
Corporation and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
<p>As explained in Note 1(b) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
effective January 1, 2001, the Company changed its accounting principles
for the measurement of redeemable preferred ESOP stock as a result of the
adoption of Topic D-98 "Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities"
and effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed certain of its accounting
principles for revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."
<p>Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule referenced in Item
14(a) 2 herein is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be
set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole.

<p><b><u>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Chapter 11 Reorganization.
</i></b>On
December 9, 2002 ("Petition Date"), UAL Corporation, United Air Lines,
Inc. and 26 direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of
the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division ("Bankruptcy Court").
The reorganization cases are being jointly administered under the caption
"In re: UAL Corporation, et al., Case No. 02-48191" ("Chapter 11 Cases").
Included in the <u>Consolidated Financial Statements</u> are subsidiaries
which have not commenced Chapter 11 cases and are not Debtors. The assets
and liabilities of such non-filing subsidiaries are not considered material
to the <u>Consolidated Financial Statements</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Debtors continue
to operate their businesses as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable
court orders. In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are authorized
under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may
not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without
the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. At hearings held on December
9, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Debtors first day motions for
various relief designed to stabilize operations and business relationships
with customers, vendors, employees and others and entered orders granting
authority to the Debtors to, among other things: (a) pay pre-petition and
post-petition employee wages, salaries, benefits and other employee obligations;
(b) honor customer service programs, including United's Mileage Plus frequent
flyer program and ticketing program; and (c) honor obligations arising
prior to the Petition Date related to the Company's interline, clearinghouse,
code sharing and other similar agreements. The Bankruptcy Court also gave
interim approval for the Debtors to access a total of up to $1.5 billion
of debtor-in-possession secured financing ("DIP Financing") provided by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank One, NA and The CIT Group/Business
Credit, Inc. Final approval of the DIP Financing was granted by the Bankruptcy
Court on December 30, 2002. (See "DIP Financing" below.)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Section 362 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the bankruptcy petition automatically
stays most actions against a debtor, including most actions to collect
pre-petition indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the
debtor's estate. Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially
all pre-petition liabilities are subject to settlement under a plan of
reorganization to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the Chapter
11 filing, the Debtors began notifying all known current or potential creditors
of the Chapter 11 filing for the purpose of identifying and quantifying
all pre-petition claims against the Debtors. The Chapter 11 filing triggered
defaults on substantially all debt and lease obligations of the Debtors.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the preceding
general discussion of the automatic stay, the Debtors' rights to possess
and operate certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related
equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional
sale contract are governed by a particular provision of the Bankruptcy
Code that specifies different treatment. Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code ("Section 1110") provides that unless the Debtors take certain action,
within 60 days after the Petition Date or such later date as is agreed
by the applicable lessor, secured party, or conditional vendor, the contractual
rights of such financier to take possession of such equipment and to enforce
any of its other rights or remedies under the applicable agreement are
not limited or otherwise affected by the automatic stay or any other provision
of the Bankruptcy Code.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the automatic stay lasts for only 60 days with respect
to Section 1110-eligible aircraft, engines and related equipment except
under two conditions. The debtor may extend the 60-day period by agreement
of the relevant financier, with court approval. Alternatively, the debtor
may agree to perform all of the obligations under the applicable financing
and cure any defaults thereunder as required by the Bankruptcy Code. In
the absence of either such arrangement, the financier may take possession
of the property and enforce any of its contractual rights or remedies to
sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such equipment.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 60-day period under Section
1110 in the Company's Chapter 11 Case expired on February 7, 2003. The
Company has reached agreements with a significant number of aircraft financiers
to extend the automatic stay, in exchange in certain instances for United's
agreement to make specified payments. United also has made elections with
respect to certain other aircraft to cure all existing defaults and to
pay the contract rates as required by the Bankruptcy Code. With respect
to certain aircraft, however, United neither negotiated an extension of
the automatic stay nor agreed to cure and resume payments. Accordingly,
the financiers of such aircraft may seek to repossess the property. Although
no such financiers have sought to repossess any United equipment, and although
the Company believes that market conditions for commercial aircraft make
repossession unlikely, there can be no assurance that United's lendors
and lessors will not repossess any of the applicable aircraft. Any such
repossessions could result in substantial disruptions to United's operations
and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject
certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including, without limitation,
leases of real property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the
approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. In general,
rejection of an unexpired lease or executory contract is treated as a pre-petition
breach of the lease or contract in question and, subject to certain exceptions,
relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such
lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a
pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed
breach. Counterparties to such rejected contracts or leases may file claims
against the Debtors' estate for such damages. Generally, the assumption
of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires the Debtors to cure
most existing defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease.
In this regard, the Company expects that liabilities subject to compromise
and resolution in the Chapter 11 Cases will arise in the future as a result
of damage claims created by the Debtors' rejection of various executory
contracts and unexpired leases. Conversely, the Company would expect that
the assumption of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases may
convert liabilities shown as subject to compromise to liabilities not subject
to compromise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1113(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to move to reject its collective bargaining
agreements ("CBAs") if the debtor first satisfies several statutorily prescribed
substantive and procedural prerequisites and obtains the Bankruptcy Court's
approval of the rejection. After bargaining in good faith and sharing relevant
information with its unions, the debtor must make proposals to modify its
existing CBAs based on the most complete and reliable information available
at the time. The proposed modifications must be necessary to permit the
reorganization of the debtor and must ensure that all the affected parties
are treated fairly and equitably relative to the creditors and the debtor.
Ultimately, rejection is appropriate if the unions refuse to agree to the
debtors necessary proposals "without good cause" and the balance of the
equities favors rejection.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As required by the
Bankruptcy Code, the United States Trustee for the Northern District of
Illinois ("U.S. Trustee") has appointed an official committee of unsecured
creditors (the "Creditors' Committee"). The Creditors Committee and its
legal representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that come
before the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Debtors. There can be no
assurance that the Creditors' Committee will support the Debtors' positions
or the Debtors' ultimate plan of reorganization, once proposed, and disagreements
between the Debtors and the Creditors' Committee could protract the Chapter
11 Cases, could negatively impact the Debtors' ability to operate during
the Chapter 11 Cases and could delay the Debtors' emergence from Chapter
11.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to successfully
exit Chapter 11, the Company will need to propose, and obtain confirmation
by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would resolve,
among other things, the Debtors' pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for
its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy. On March 21,
2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the extension of the Company's "exclusivity
period" (during which it is the only party permitted to file a plan of
reorganization) to October 2003, but under certain circumstances, the exclusivity
period could be shortened by two months. The timing of filing a plan of
reorganization by the Company will depend on the timing and outcome of
numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases. Although the Company
expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides for its emergence
from bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance at this time
that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court,
or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Financial Statement
Presentation</b>. </i>The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants' Statement of Position 90-7 ("SOP 90-7"), "Financial Reporting
by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code," and on a going-concern
basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOP 90-7 requires that the
financial statements for periods subsequent to the Chapter 11 filing petition
distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the
reorganization from the operations of the business. Accordingly, revenues,
expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses, and
provisions for losses directly associated with the reorganization and restructuring
of the business are reported separately in the financial statements. The
<u>Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position</u> distinguish pre-petition liabilities
subject to compromise from both those pre-petition liabilities that are
not subject to compromise and from post-petition liabilities. Liabilities
subject to compromise are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed,
even if they may be settled for lesser amounts.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, as a result
of the Chapter 11 filing, the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership,
are subject to uncertainty. Given this uncertainty, there is substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. While
operating as debtors-in-possession under the protection of Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code and subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court or
otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business, the Debtors,
or some of them, may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate
or settle liabilities for some amounts other than those reflected in the
consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could
materially change the amounts and classifications in the historical consolidated
financial statements.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the Bankruptcy
Code, the Debtors have filed schedules with the Bankruptcy Court setting
forth the assets and liabilities of the Debtors as of the Petition Date.
Differences between amounts recorded by the Debtors and claims filed by
creditors will be investigated and resolved as part of the Chapter 11 Cases.
The deadline for filing proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court is May
12, 2003, with a limited exception for governmental entities, which have
until June 9, 2003 to file proofs of claim. Accordingly, the ultimate number
and allowed amounts of such claims are not presently known.
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DIP Financing.
</i></b>The
DIP Financing consists of two facilities, a $300 million facility provided
by Bank One N.A. ("Bank One Facility") and a $1.2 billion facility provided
by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank One, N.A. and The CIT
Group/Business Credit, Inc. ("Club Facility"). The Company has received
commitments of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility following the completion
of the syndication process for that facility; the balance is conditioned
upon the participation of one or more additional lenders approved by the
existing participants.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bank One Facility
consists of a $300 million term loan with an interest rate option of the
prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%). As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $300 million at the LIBOR
option which is due in five equal monthly installments beginning in March
2004.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Club Facility consists
of a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of $800 million and
a term loan of $400 million, which matures on July 1, 2004. The Company
has the option of borrowing under the Club Facility at an interest rate
of the prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%).
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $400 million under the
term loan at the LIBOR option. In addition, the Company had available a
$100 million letter of credit facility which was not drawn down on in December,
but was fully utilized by March 2003. The remaining $700 million under
the revolving credit facility is subject to stringent availability hurdles
as discussed below.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DIP Financing is
guaranteed by each of the Debtors and is secured by first priority liens
on all unencumbered present and future assets of the Debtors and by junior
liens on all other assets of the Debtors, other than certain specified
assets, including assets which are subject to financing agreements that
are entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 to the extent such financing
agreements prohibit such junior liens. In addition, the Bank One Facility
is secured by cash collateral collected under the Co-Branded Credit Card
Agreement between Bank One and the Company.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terms of the DIP
Financing include covenants that require the Company to satisfy ongoing
monthly financial requirements as determined by EBITDAR (earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rents)
and covenants that limit, among other things, the Debtors' ability to borrow
additional money, make capital expenditures and make additional corporate
investments. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a minimum
unrestricted cash balance, excluding escrowed amounts, of $300 million.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Club Facility,
borrowing availability is determined by a formula based on a percentage
of eligible assets. The eligible assets consist of certain previously unencumbered
aircraft, spare engines, spare parts inventory, certain flight simulators
and quick engine change kits. The underlying value of such assets may fluctuate
periodically due to prevailing market conditions and fluctuations in value
may have an impact on the borrowing availability under the Club Facility.
Availability may be further limited by additional reserves imposed by the
banks in their commercially reasonable discretion.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining $700
million of availability under the Club Facility, subject to the limitation
on borrowing availability discussed above, will be available to the Company
after certain conditions are met, including achieving positive cumulative
EBITDAR; submitting a certified updated business plan; providing updated
appraisals on the collateral and ascertaining there has been no material
adverse change with respect to transferability of routes, gate leaseholds
or slots.
<p><b><u>(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(a) Basis of Presentation</i>
- -</b> UAL is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is United. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UAL and all of
its majority-owned affiliates (collectively "the Company"). All significant
intercompany transactions are eliminated. Certain prior-year financial
statement items have been reclassified to conform to the current year's
presentation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(b) Use of Estimates</i>
- -</b> The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Airline Revenues</i></b>
- - Passenger fares and cargo revenues are recorded as operating revenues
when the transportation is furnished. The value of unused passenger tickets
is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. In addition,
United has formed bilateral alliances with other airlines which include:
joint frequent flyer participation; code sharing of flight operations;
coordination of reservations, baggage handling and flight schedules and
other resource-sharing activities. Code sharing is an agreement under which
a carrier's flights can be marketed under the two-letter airline designator
code of another carrier. Revenues earned under these arrangements are allocated
between the code share partners based on existing contractual agreements
and airline industry standard pro-ration formulas and are recognized as
passenger revenue when the transportation is provided.
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents
and Short-Term Investments</i> -</b> Cash in excess of operating requirements
is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing investments.
Investments with a maturity of three months or less on their acquisition
date are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Other investments are
classified as short-term investments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, United
lends certain of its securities classified as cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments to third parties. United requires collateral
in an amount exceeding the value of the securities and is obligated to
reacquire the securities at the end of the contract. United accounts for
these transactions as secured borrowings rather than sales and does not
remove the securities from the balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, United
had no secured borrowings outstanding.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002 and
2001, $402 million and $526 million, respectively, of investments in debt
securities included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
were classified as available-for-sale, and $714 million and $2.0 billion,
respectively, were classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt
securities classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair value based
on the quoted market prices for the securities, which does not differ significantly
from their cost basis. Investments classified as held-to-maturity are stated
at cost which approximates market due to their short-term maturities. The
gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale securities are included
in interest income for each respective year.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002, the
Company had $578 million in restricted cash, including $116 million in
long-term restricted cash. The cash largely represents security for worker
compensation obligations in states where United self-insures, security
deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions which process
the Company's sales.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(e) Aircraft Fuel,
Spare Parts and Supplies</i> -</b> Aircraft fuel and maintenance and operating
supplies are stated at average cost. Flight equipment spare parts are stated
at average cost less an obsolescence allowance.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(f) Operating Property
and Equipment</i> -</b> Owned operating property and equipment is stated
at cost. Property under capital leases, and the related obligation for
future lease payments, are initially recorded at an amount equal to the
then present value of those lease payments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depreciation and amortization
of owned depreciable assets is based on the straight-line method over their
estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
remaining period of the lease or the estimated service life of the related
asset, whichever is less. Aircraft are depreciated to estimated salvage
values, generally over lives of 25 to 30 years; buildings are depreciated
over lives of 25 to 45 years; and other property and equipment are depreciated
over lives of 3 to 15 years.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Properties under capital
leases are amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease
or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated service lives.
Lease terms are 10 to 22 years for aircraft and flight simulators and 29
years for buildings. Amortization of capital leases is included in depreciation
and amortization expense.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of minor replacements, are charged to maintenance expense
accounts as incurred. Costs of additions to and renewals of units of property
are charged to property and equipment accounts.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(g) Mileage Plus Awards</i>
- -</b> UAL accrues the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel
awards earned under its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program when such award
levels are reached. United sells mileage credits to participating airline
partners in the Mileage Plus program and UAL Loyalty Services ("ULS"),
a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL, sells mileage credits to non-airline
business partners.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A portion of revenue from
the sale of mileage credits is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue
when the transportation is provided. Accordingly, UAL recorded a charge
of $209 million, net of tax, in 2000, for the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle to reflect the application of the accounting method
to prior years. This change resulted in a reduction to revenues of approximately
$38 million for 2000.
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h) Deferred Gains</i>
- -</b> Gains on aircraft sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and
amortized over the lives of the leases as a reduction of rental expense.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(i) United Express</i></b>
- - United has marketing agreements under which independent regional carriers,
flying under the United Express name, feed passengers to United owned and
operated flights. United pays these carriers on a fee-per-departure basis
and includes the revenues derived from the carriers in passenger revenue,
net of these expenses. United Express revenues (net of expenses) included
in passenger revenues were $(255) million, $(232) million and $(49) million
for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the effect on
United's results, taking into account only the United Express flights,
is negative, the Company realizes a significant benefit (not included in
the results shown above) from the traffic provided to United's operations
as a result of these agreements.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United has call options
on 83 regional jets owned or leased by these carriers. The call option
is a standard part of the United Express agreement and is intended to allow
United to secure control over regional jets used for United Express flying
in the event a United Express agreement is terminated. The call option
reduces this risk if the Company determines that a change of United Express
carrier is necessary, particularly due to the significant time lag between
order and delivery of aircraft (such as regional jets made to United's
specifications).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The call options are
only exercisable if United maintains a specified credit rating and the
United Express carrier fails to meet required operating and/or financial
performance levels for a specified period of time. Due to United's current
credit rating, none of the call options are exercisable at this time.
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (j) Advertising</i></b>
- - Advertising costs, which are included in other operating expenses, are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $169 million, $217 million
and $269 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (k) Intangibles</i></b>
- - Intangibles consist primarily of route acquisition costs and intangible
pension assets (see Note 20, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans").
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective January 1, 2002,
UAL adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS
No. 142"). In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, UAL discontinued
$12 million in annual amortization expense on route acquisition costs,
which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 also requires
companies to test intangibles for impairment on an annual basis or on an
interim basis when a triggering event occurs. During the first quarter
of 2002, the Company performed an initial evaluation of its intangibles
and determined that the fair value of its intangibles was in excess of
the book value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following information
relates to UAL's intangibles at December 31, 2002:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slots and gates are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related leases.
Other intangibles are amortized over periods of 3 to 10 years. Total amortization
expense recognized in 2002 was $12 million. The Company expects to record
amortization expense of $8 million in 2003, $7 million in 2004 and 2005,
$6 million in 2006 and $4 million in 2007.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Route authorities are
rights granted by governments to operate flights to and from a particular
country. These authorities are very specific and limited, fixed in nature
and are rarely available in the marketplace. Accordingly, route authorities
are highly valued and sought after assets by all airlines. During 2002,
UAL obtained a third-party appraisal of its route authorities which concluded
that the market value of these assets continues to be considerably in excess
of the book value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slots and gates, like
routes, are highly valued assets that do not frequently come into the marketplace.
The Company has no intention to sell these assets and believes that the
market value is in excess of the recorded book value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodwill primarily
relates to UAL Loyalty Services' ("ULS") acquisition of MyPoints.com, which
occurred in July 2001 and is based on the final purchase price allocation.
Management believes that the cash flows of ULS's operation, as reflected
in Note 23, "Segment Information" are sufficient to support the value of
these intangibles and goodwill.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pro forma results for
the years ended 2001 and 2000 assuming the discontinuation of amortization
are shown below:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(l) Measurement of
Impairments</i></b> - Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"
("SFAS No. 144"), which addresses the accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 did not have
an effect on the Company's results of operations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United's policy is
to recognize an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds
its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount
of the charge is the difference between the asset's carrying value and
fair market value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>(m) Stock Option Accounting</i></b>
- - At December 31, 2002, the Company had certain stock-based employee compensation
plans, as described in Note 18, "Stock Options and Awards." The Company
has elected to continue accounting for those plans under the recognition
and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations.
No stock-based employee compensation cost pertaining to stock options is
reflected in the Company's net earnings (loss), as all options granted
under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. If compensation cost for
stock-based employee compensation plans had been determined using the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," the Company's net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per
share would have instead been reported as the pro forma amounts indicated
below:

<p><b><u>(3) Special Charges</u></b>
<p><b><i>2002 -</i></b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Avolar.</i></b>On
March 22, 2002, UAL announced the orderly shutdown of its wholly owned
subsidiary Avolar, which was formed in early 2001 to operate and sell fractional
ownership interests in premium business aircraft. In connection with the
closing of Avolar, UAL recorded a special charge of $82 million in the
first quarter 2002 which included aircraft deposits and termination fees
($55 million), operating related expenses ($18 million), severance related
costs ($7 million) and other costs ($2 million).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity," the
Company identified those charges which should be recognized at the time
management had committed to an exit plan. The special charge included current
period and future estimated liabilities incurred which would produce no
future economic benefit to UAL.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, the current
period expenses included in the charge were related to obligations incurred
prior to the commitment date which would not produce any future benefit
to the Company and included costs for promotional flights, consultant fees
for the development of computer systems, advertising in anticipation of
operations and other miscellaneous expenses.
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Severance.</i></b>
During the fourth quarter of 2002, UAL announced the closing of three reservation
centers, a maintenance line and four international stations and the conversion
of five stations in the U.S. to United Express service, which resulted
in the furloughing of a number of employees. Additionally, in connection
with the Company's plan to decrease the airline's flying schedule, as well
as overall cost-saving measures, the Company announced a reduction in employment
levels effective January and February 2003. As a result of the announced
furloughs, the Company recorded a special charge of $67 million in the
fourth quarter of 2002 for severance-related charges.
<p><b><i>2001 -</i></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Related to September
11.</i> </b>During the third quarter of 2001, United recorded a special
charge of $1.3 billion in operating expense and $49 million in non-operating
expense for amounts relating to the September 11 terrorist attacks and
the resulting impact on the Company's schedule and operations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The special charge
in operating expense was made up of the following (in millions):

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the September
11 terrorist attacks, the Company grounded the B727-200 and B737-200 fleets
and recorded a charge of $271 million, reflecting the write down of the
fleets to fair value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the changes
implemented to United's operations, the Company reviewed its fleet for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, as amended by SFAS No. 144.
Management determined that the estimated net undiscounted future cash flows
generated by its B737-500 and B747-400 fleets would be less than their
carrying value. Management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows
with models used by the Company in making fleet and scheduling decisions.
These models utilized the Company's projections of passenger yield, fuel
costs, labor costs and other relevant factors for the markets where these
aircraft will operate. The aircraft in each of these fleets were written
down to their fair market values, as estimated by management using published
sources, third-party appraisals and bids received from third parties. Accordingly,
the special charge includes an impairment charge of $517 million for these
aircraft fleets resulting from the anticipated decrease in future cash
flows.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also as a result
of the terrorist attacks, the Company furloughed approximately 20,000 employees
across all work groups (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, ramp service,
customer service and management and salaried employees). In connection
with the furloughs, United accrued severance costs of approximately $217
million, including a one-time curtailment charge relating to the accelerated
recognition of unrecognized prior service costs for certain of the Company's
pension plans.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also included in the
special charge is $107 million relating to the write-off of capital projects
no longer being pursued. As a direct result of September 11, management
made the decision to terminate all funding and labor resources for numerous
capitalized projects that were in-process prior to September 11 and which
did not provide any immediate economic or long-term safety benefits to
customers or the airline. The projects and related amounts capitalized
that were discontinued following September 11 included computer system
development costs ($48 million), aircraft improvements ($33 million), airport
facility improvements ($21 million) and other miscellaneous projects ($5
million).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After management announced
the furlough and the freeze on all capital expenditures, United determined
that the Company was unlikely to meet certain commitments or provisions
of certain executory contracts with third parties. The executory contracts
are related to agreements with state and local governments ($157 million),
aircraft improvements ($11 million) and facilities and other ($13 million)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally,
the Company recorded a non-operating special charge of $49 million related
to certain non-operating aircraft that were leased to others. The fair
value of these aircraft was significantly impacted by the events of September
11.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the Air
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the "Act")
enacted in response to the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government
made $5.0 billion in federal grants available to the airline industry.
The Company received a total of $782 million in grants under the Act, of
which $652 million was received in 2001 and $130 million in 2002. These
amounts represent the Company's total allocation of grant money under the
Act.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following is a reconciliation
of activity related to the accruals for the reduction in force and early
termination fees:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2002, the Company
reversed $44 million of overaccruals pertaining to the reduction in force
as a result of the Company furloughing fewer employees than was initially
anticipated in early 2002.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through December 31,
2002, the Company had received approximately $58 million related to insurance
recoveries on aircraft destroyed by the September 11 attacks and approximately
$12 million related to other covered expenses.&nbsp; The Company anticipates
that its liability from claims arising from the events of September 11,
2001 will be significant, after considering the liability protections provided
for by the Act; however, the Company expects that any amounts paid on such
claims will be borne by its insurance carriers as claims are resolved and,
in any event, the Company believes that, under the Act, its liability will
be limited to its insurance coverage.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has not
incurred any material environmental obligations relating to September 11.
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>US Airways Merger.</i></b>During
the second quarter of 2001, UAL recognized a special charge of $116 million
for incremental direct costs incurred related to the potential acquisition
of US Airways Group, Inc. that was ultimately terminated. In addition to
a $50 million termination fee, the Company incurred costs of $29 million
related to integration project management, $16 million in legal fees and
$21 million in other professional fees that were written off.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, the Company
permanently grounded certain BAe Turbo-Prop aircraft which had been used
in the United Express operation and announced the planned early retirement
of the B727-222 aircraft fleet resulting in an impairment charge of $33
million, in accordance with SFAS No. 121, as amended by SFAS No. 144. In
connection with the grounding of the BAe aircraft, the Company also incurred
a charge of $16 million for losses related to subleases, in accordance
with FASB Technical Bulletin 79-15, "Accounting for Loss on a Sublease
Not Involving the Disposal of a Segment."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company also announced
its decision to end its freighter operation effective December 24, 2000,
resulting in the early retirement of four DC10-30 freighter aircraft which
were under lease. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $12 million
in the fourth quarter of 2000. Additionally, the Company permanently grounded
seven leased B747-238 aircraft in the second quarter of 2000 and recorded
a $24 million charge, as the aircraft continued to be leased but were no
longer used for operating purposes beyond 2000.&nbsp; These charges were
recognized in accordance with EITF 88-10, "Costs Associated with Lease
Modification or Termination," as it was determined that the grounded, leased
aircraft and improvements had no substantive future use or benefit. Accordingly,
the remaining rental payments and capitalized leasehold improvements were
written-off.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Company
recorded a charge of $37 million in the second quarter of 2000 when the
Company retired the inflight video system on certain B777-222 aircraft,
which was replaced by an enhanced and more reliable inflight video system.
The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $17 million to reduce
the carrying value of certain equipment no longer used in the Company's
operations as of the fourth quarter 2000, to net realizable value in accordance
with SFAS No. 121.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Priceline. </i></b>In
1999, United received 5.5 million warrants convertible into 5.5 million
shares of Priceline common stock at an exercise price of $52.625, which
were recorded at their fair value of $61 million. In the third quarter
of 2000, United recorded an impairment loss of $38 million, net of tax,
in non-operating expense, for the write-down of these warrants to zero.
Subsequent to the third quarter of 2000, the Company sold all of its warrants
in Priceline for less than $1 million in proceeds.
<p><b><u>(4) Per Share Amounts</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic earnings per share
were computed by dividing net earnings (loss) before extraordinary item
and cumulative effect by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the year and potential participating ESOP preferred
shares in periods where such shares are dilutive using the if-converted
method. In addition, diluted earnings per share amounts include potential
common shares, including common shares issuable upon conversion of ESOP
shares committed to be released.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002, stock
options to purchase 12,850,750 shares of common stock were outstanding,
but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share,
because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average
market price of the common shares. In addition, 33,857,761 shares of convertible
ESOP preferred stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings
per share, as the result would be antidilutive.

<p><b><u>(6)&nbsp; Other Income (Expense) - Miscellaneous</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Included in Other income
(expense) - "Miscellaneous, net" was $(13) million, $(21) million and $(22)
million of foreign exchange gains (losses) in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
<p><b><u>(7) Income Taxes</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2002, UAL incurred both
a regular and an alternative minimum tax ("AMT") loss. The carryback of
the AMT loss to 1998 and 1999 will produce a federal tax refund, thereby
reducing AMT credits. The primary differences between UAL's regular tax
loss and AMT loss are the depreciation adjustments and preferences.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In assessing the realizability
of its deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely
than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized.
During 2002, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred
tax assets.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provision (credit) for
income taxes is summarized as follows:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002, UAL
and its subsidiaries had $294 million of federal AMT credits and $1.6 billion
of federal and state net operating loss ("NOL") credits which may be carried
forward to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. Federal NOL credits
of $218 million expire in 2022 and $1.2 billion expire in 2023.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") rules would place the Company's NOLs at risk if an ownership
change occurs during the three years prior to emergence from bankruptcy.
An ownership change is triggered if shareholders owning 5% or more of the
stock change their holdings in the aggregate by at least 50 percentage
points. Consequently, the Bankruptcy Court has entered an injunction preventing
trading in the Company's securities by substantial equity holders and claimholders,
including the ESOP trustee, State Street Bank &amp; Trust.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 4, 2003, the
Company announced that it had received a private letter ruling from the
IRS which would permit the Company to allow the additional sale of UAL
common stock held by the ESOP without jeopardizing these tax benefits.
(See Note 16, "ESOP Preferred Stock" and Note 19, "Employee Stock Ownership
Plans" for further details.)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has determined,
based on its history of operating earnings (losses) and current declaration
of bankruptcy, that it is more likely than not that the gross deferred
tax assets, net of valuation allowances at December 31, 2002 are expected
to be realized through the reversals of existing deferred tax credits.
<p><b><u>(8) Investments</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2000, United
owned 15,940,000 shares (18%) in Galileo, a leading provider of electronic
global distribution services for the travel industry. On October 1, 2001,
Cendant Corporation ("Cendant") acquired all of the outstanding common
stock of Galileo for a combination of stock and cash. Accordingly, United
tendered all of its shares in Galileo for net proceeds of $65 million and
21,168,320 shares in Cendant, resulting in a gain of $244 million. In the
fourth quarter of 2001, United sold 14 million shares of Cendant common
stock for net proceeds of $194 million, resulting in a gain of $17 million.
In January 2002, United sold its remaining investment in Cendant for net
proceeds of $137 million, resulting in a gain of $46 million.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, 2001 and 2002,
ULS invested approximately $53 million in Orbitz, an Internet travel web
site. ULS owns approximately 22% of Orbitz and accounts for this investment
using the equity method of accounting.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 1998 and 1999, United
invested approximately $51 million in GetThere.com resulting in a 28% minority
interest consisting of common stock, warrants and options. United accounted
for its investment in GetThere.com using the equity method of accounting.
On October 6, 2000, Sabre Holdings Corporation acquired all of the outstanding
common stock of GetThere.com for $17.75 per share. Accordingly, after converting
its options and warrants, United tendered all of its shares for net proceeds
of $147 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $69 million, net
of tax.
<p><b><u>(9) Acquisitions</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 18, 2001, ULS successfully
completed its cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding common
stock of MyPoints.com for $2.60 per share. MyPoints.com is an Internet-based
direct marketing and membership services company, known for its database-driven
loyalty infrastructure. Including the costs related to vested management
stock options, outstanding warrants and transaction-related expenditures,
the aggregate cost of the acquisition was approximately $118 million ($32
million, net of cash acquired). The Company recorded approximately $32
million to goodwill and intangible assets based on the final purchase price
allocation. This transaction is being accounted for under the purchase
method, in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations."
<p><b><u>(10) Liabilities Subject to Compromise</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liabilities subject
to compromise refers to liabilities incurred prior to the commencement
of the Chapter 11 Cases. These amounts represent the Company's estimate
of known or potential pre-petition claims to be resolved in connection
with the Chapter 11 Cases. Such claims remain subject to future adjustments.
Adjustments may result from negotiations, actions of the Bankruptcy Court,
rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases, the determination
as to the value of any collateral securing claims, proofs of claim or other
events. It is anticipated that such adjustments may be material. Payment
terms for these amounts will be established in connection with the Chapter
11 Cases.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002,
the Company had liabilities subject to compromise of approximately $13.8
billion which consisted of the following:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002, United
had outstanding a total of $3.9 billion of debt at variable rates from
2.03% to 9.52% based on specified spreads over LIBOR.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December 2002, the
Company borrowed $700 million under the DIP Facility as described more
fully in Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2002, the Company
refinanced approximately $525 million in interim financing through a $775
million private debt financing which refinanced certain aircraft. The Company
also arranged long-term financing for approximately $314 million in debt
that had been placed in interim financing facilities and refinanced $238
million in long-term debt through a sale-leaseback transaction.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 2000, the Company
issued $921 million in enhanced equipment trust certificates ("EETCs")
to refinance certain owned aircraft and aircraft under operating leases.
Net proceeds after refinancing the operating leases was $622 million. In
December 2000, the Company issued an additional $1.5 billion in EETCs to
finance certain owned aircraft and in August 2001, the Company issued $1.5
billion in EETCs to finance certain owned aircraft. Also during 2001, the
Company issued $1.0 billion in long-term debt to finance the acquisition
of aircraft.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to scheduled
principal payments, in 2000 the Company repaid $116 million in principal
amount of debentures prior to maturity. The debentures were scheduled to
mature at various times through 2021. An extraordinary loss of $6 million,
net of tax benefits of $4 million was recorded, reflecting amounts paid
in excess of the debt carrying value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002, United
had recorded $493 million in special facilities revenue bonds to finance
the acquisition and construction of certain facilities at Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Miami and Chicago. United guarantees the payment of these
bonds under various payment and loan agreements. The bond proceeds are
restricted to expenditures on the facilities and unspent amounts are classified
as other assets in the <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial Position</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Various assets, principally
aircraft, having an aggregate book value of $11.0 billion at December 31,
2002, were pledged as security under various loan agreements.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The carrying amount
of the Company's borrowings under the DIP Facility approximates the fair
value. The fair value of the Company's debt included in liabilities subject
to compromise cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2002. The
fair value of debt at December 31, 2001 was $6.9 billion.
<p><b><u>(13) Lease Obligations</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company leases aircraft,
airport passenger terminal space, aircraft hangars and related maintenance
facilities, cargo terminals, other airport facilities, real estate, office
and computer equipment and vehicles. As allowed under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Company may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain
executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property,
aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and certain other conditions. Consequently, the Company anticipates
that its liabilities pertaining to leases, and the amounts related thereto
as discussed below, will change significantly in the future.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002, scheduled
future minimum lease payments under capital leases (substantially all of
which are for aircraft) and operating leases having initial or remaining
noncancelable lease terms of more than one year were as follows:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of December 31, 2002,
United leased 300 aircraft, 59 of which were under capital leases. These
leases have terms of 5 to 26 years, and expiration dates ranging from 2003
through 2018. Under the terms of all leases, United has the right to purchase
the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some cases at fair market
value and in others at fair market value or a percentage of cost. The theoretical
present value of United's future minimum lease payments under operating
leases for aircraft and non-aircraft was $5.2 billion and $3.5 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2002.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain of the Company's
aircraft lease transactions contain provisions such as put options giving
the lessor the right to require the Company to purchase the aircraft at
lease termination for a certain amount resulting in residual value guarantees.
Leases containing this or similar provisions are recorded as capital leases
on the statement of financial position and, accordingly, any and all residual
value guarantee amounts contained in an aircraft lease are fully reflected
as capital lease obligations on the <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial
Position</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the financing
of certain aircraft accounted for as capital leases, United had on deposit
at December 31, 2002 an aggregate 42 billion yen ($357 million), 387 million
euro ($405 million) and $14 million in certain banks and had pledged an
irrevocable security interest in such deposits to certain of the aircraft
lessors. These deposits will be used to pay off an equivalent amount of
recorded capital lease obligations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amounts charged to rent expense,
net of minor amounts of sublease rentals, were $1.5 billion in 2002, $1.4
billion in 2001 and $1.5 billion in 2000. Included in 2002 rental expense
was $11<b> </b>million in contingent rentals, resulting from changes in
interest rates for operating leases under which the rent payments are based
on variable interest rates.
<p><b><u>(14) Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities
of a Subsidiary Trust</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December 1996, UAL Corporation
Capital Trust I (the "Trust") issued $75 million of its 13 1/4% Trust Originated
Preferred Securities (the "Preferred Securities") in exchange for 2,999,304
depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of one share of Series B 12
1/4% preferred stock (see Note 15, "Serial Preferred Stock"). Concurrent
with the issuance of the Preferred Securities and the related purchase
by UAL of the Trust's common securities, the Company issued to the Trust
$77 million aggregate principal amount of its 13 1/4% Junior Subordinated
Debentures (the "Debentures") due 2026. The Debentures are and will be
the sole assets of the Trust. The interest and other payment dates on the
Debentures correspond to the distribution and other payment dates on the
Preferred Securities. Upon maturity or redemption of the Debentures, the
Preferred Securities will be mandatorily redeemed. The Debentures are redeemable
at UAL's option, in whole or in part, on or after July 12, 2004, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Upon the repayment of the Debentures,
the proceeds thereof will be applied to redeem the Preferred Securities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a full and unconditional
guarantee by UAL of the Trust's obligations under the securities issued
by the Trust. However, the Company's obligations are subordinate and junior
in right of payment to certain other of its indebtedness. UAL has the right
to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by extending the interest
payment period, at any time, for up to 20 consecutive quarters. If interest
payments on the Debentures are so deferred, distributions on the Preferred
Securities will also be deferred. During any deferral, distributions will
continue to accrue with interest thereon. In addition, during any such
deferral, UAL may not declare or pay any dividend or other distribution
on, or redeem or purchase, any of its capital stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the Chapter
11 filing, the Company is in default to the Trust and is no longer making
interest payments on the Debentures. As a result, the Trust will no longer
have the funds available to pay distributions on the Preferred Securities
and stopped accruing and paying such dividends in October 2002. The Trust
is in default on the Preferred Securities. As the Company is a guarantor
on the outstanding Debentures, as a result of the default, the Company
has become a debtor to the holders of the Preferred Securities directly.
This liability is a pre-petition liability and has been classified as liabilities
subject to compromise. Additionally, the Company is no longer accruing
for distributions on the Preferred Securities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fair value of the Preferred
Securities at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $3 million and $57 million,
respectively.
<p><b><u>(15) Serial Preferred Stock</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2002, UAL
had outstanding 3,203,177 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of
one share of Series B 12 1/4% preferred stock, with a liquidation preference
of $25 per depositary share ($25,000 per Series B preferred share) and
a stated capital of $0.01 per Series B preferred share. Under its terms,
any portion of the Series B preferred stock or the depositary shares is
redeemable for cash after July 11, 2004, at UAL's option, at the equivalent
of $25 per depositary share, plus accrued dividends. The Series B preferred
stock is not convertible into any other securities, has no stated maturity
and is not subject to mandatory redemption.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Series B preferred stock
ranks senior to all other preferred and common stock outstanding, except
the Preferred Securities, as to receipt of dividends and amounts distributed
upon liquidation. The Series B preferred stock has voting rights only to
the extent required by law and with respect to charter amendments that
adversely affect the preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any
security ranking senior to the preferred stock. Additionally, if dividends
are not paid for six cumulative quarters, the Series B preferred stockholders
are entitled to elect two additional members to the UAL Board of Directors
until all dividends are paid in full. Pursuant to UAL's restated certificate
of incorporation, UAL is authorized to issue a total of 50,000 shares of
Series B preferred stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 30, 2002, UAL
announced that it was suspending the payment of dividends on the Series
B preferred stock. As a result of the Chapter 11 filing, the Company is
no longer accruing for dividends on the Series B preferred stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL is authorized to issue
up to 15,986,584 additional shares of serial preferred stock.
<p><b><u>(16) ESOP Preferred Stock</u></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An aggregate of 17,675,345
shares of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock were issued to employees
under the ESOPs. Each share of ESOP Preferred Stock is convertible into
four shares of UAL common stock. Shares typically are converted to common
as employees retire or otherwise leave the Company. The stock has a par
value of $0.01 per share and is nonvoting. The Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP
Preferred Stocks have a liquidation value of $126.96 per share. The Class
1 ESOP Preferred Stock provided a fixed annual dividend of $8.8872 per
share, which ceased on March 31, 2000; the Class 2 does not pay a fixed
dividend.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class P, M and S Voting Preferred
Stocks were established to provide the voting power to the employee groups
participating in the ESOPs. Additional Voting Preferred Stock were issued
as shares of the Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock were allocated
to employees. In the aggregate, 17,675,345 shares of Voting Preferred Stock
were issued through the year 2000. The Voting Preferred Stock outstanding
at any time commands voting power for approximately 55% of the vote of
all classes of capital stock in all matters requiring a stockholder vote,
other than for the election of members of the Board of Directors. The Voting
Preferred Stock has a par value and liquidation preference of $0.01 per
share. The stock is not entitled to receive any dividends and is convertible
into .0004 shares of UAL common stock.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class Pilot MEC, IAM, SAM
and I junior preferred stock (collectively "Director Preferred Stocks")
were established to effectuate the election of one or more members to UAL's
Board of Directors. One share each of Class Pilot MEC and Class IAM junior
preferred stock is authorized and issued. The Company is authorized to
issue ten shares each of Class SAM and Class I junior preferred stock.
There were three shares of Class SAM and four shares of Class I issued
at December 31, 2002. Each of the Director Preferred Stocks has a par value
and liquidation preference of $0.01 per share. The stock is not entitled
to receive any dividends and Class I was redeemed automatically upon "Sunset,"
which occurred March 7, 2003, as discussed below.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 2002,
State Street Bank and Trust ("State Street") was appointed as an independent
fiduciary for the ESOP. On September 27, 2002, State Street filed a Form
144 "Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities" ("Form 144") with the SEC to
indicate it may sell up to 10,964,700 shares of UAL common stock over the
next three months. On October 25, 2002, November 22, 2002 and December
9, 2002, State Street amended its Form 144 to sell an additional 4,040,758,
10,283,398 and 28,291,896, respectively. The shares of common stock are
issuable upon the conversion of shares of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock held by the plan and are issued on a private placement basis to State
Street. As of December 31, 2002, State Street had converted 6.0 million
shares of ESOP Preferred Stock to an equivalent 24.0 million common shares
and sold them on the open market, pursuant to the Form 144 as amended.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 9, 2002,
the Company filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to prevent the sale
of UAL common stock by substantial holders of equity or claims in order
to protect its NOLs. (See Note 7, "Income Taxes.") The Bankruptcy Court
issued a temporary injunction but permitted the Company to allow State
Street to sell a certain number of shares. In January 2003, State Street
was allowed to convert an additional 3.2 million shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock to an equivalent 12.8 million common shares and sell them on the
open market. On March 4, 2003, the Company announced it had received a
private letter ruling from the IRS which would allow the Company to permit
State Street to sell an additional 3.9 million shares of UAL common stock
without jeopardizing its NOLs. State Street then converted 0.9 million
shares of ESOP Preferred Stock to an equivalent 3.9 million common shares
and sold them on the open market.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in September 2002,
the United Air Lines, Inc. Pension and Welfare Plans Administrative Committee
appointed AON Fiduciary Counselors, Inc. ("AON") as an independent fiduciary
for the UAL Stock Funds offered in the Company's 401(k) plans. On September
27, 2002, AON filed a Form 144 with the SEC to indicate it may sell up
to 10,577,325 shares of UAL common stock in the 401(k) plans. Simultaneous
with the filing of the Form 144, AON directed Fidelity Investments ("Fidelity")
and Frank Russell Trust Company ("Frank Russell") to cease the purchase
of UAL common stock and to raise the amount of cash held in the UAL Stock
Fund to 20% by selling UAL common stock. As of December 31, 2002, Fidelity
and Frank Russell had sold all of the UAL common stock previously held
by the plans.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employee voting under
the ESOP is determined by Voting Preferred Stock and not by Class 1 and
Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock. The Voting Preferred Stock will generally
continue to represent approximately 55% of the aggregate voting power until
"Sunset," even though the common stock issuable upon conversion of the
ESOP stock may represent more or less than 55% of the fully diluted common
stock of UAL. Sunset will occur when the common shares issuable upon conversion
of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, plus any common shares held
by any other Company sponsored employee benefit plan, plus any available
unissued ESOP shares held in the ESOPs, equal, in the aggregate, less than
20% of the common equity (generally common stock issued or issuable at
the time of the recapitalization), and available unissued ESOP shares of
UAL. For purposes of measuring the Sunset, employee ownership was approximately
33% at December 31, 2002. As a result of the additional sales of UAL common
stock discussed above, employee ownership was reduced to less than 20%
on March 7, 2003, thus triggering the Sunset.
<p><b><u>(17) Common Stockholders' Equity</u></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2000, the Company
repurchased 1,258,263 shares of common stock on the open market at a total
purchase price of $81 million.
<p><b><u>(18) Stock Options and Awards</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has granted options
to purchase common stock to various officers and employees. The option
price for all stock options is at least 100% of the fair market value of
UAL common stock at the date of grant. Options generally vest and become
exercisable in four equal, annual installments beginning one year after
the date of grant, and generally expire in ten years.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has also awarded
shares of restricted stock to officers and key employees. These shares
generally vest over a five-year period and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior to vesting.
Unearned compensation, representing the fair market value of the stock
at the measurement date for the award, is amortized to salaries and related
costs over the vesting period. During 2002 and 2000, respectively, 175,000
and 23,000 shares of restricted stock were issued from treasury. No shares
were issued in 2001. The amortization of restricted stock resulted in $1
million in compensation expense being recorded in 2002 and $2 million in
each of the years 2001 and 2000. As of December 31, 2002, 263,800 shares
were restricted and unvested.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SFAS No. 123 establishes
a fair value based method of accounting for stock options. As discussed
in Note 2(m), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Stock Option
Accounting," the Company has elected to continue using the intrinsic value
method of accounting prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as permitted by SFAS
No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition
and Disclosure."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weighted-average grant
date fair value of restricted shares issued was $3.03 for shares issued
in 2002 and $51.83 for shares issued in 2000. The fair value of each option
grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's
stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion,
the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure
of the fair value of its stock options.

<p><b><u>(19)&nbsp; Employee Stock Ownership Plans</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 12, 1994, the stockholders
of UAL approved a plan of recapitalization to provide an approximately
55% equity interest in UAL to certain employees of United in exchange for
wage concessions and work-rule changes. The employees' equity interest
was allocated to individual employees through the year 2000 under ESOPs
which were created as a part of the recapitalization.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ESOPs cover employees
represented by ALPA, the IAM and U.S. management and salaried employees
and include a "Leveraged ESOP," a "Non-Leveraged ESOP" and a "Supplemental
ESOP." Both the Leveraged ESOP and the Non-Leveraged ESOP are tax-qualified
plans while the Supplemental ESOP is not a tax-qualified plan.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The equity interests were
delivered to employees through two classes of preferred stock (Class 1
and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, collectively "ESOP Preferred Stock"),
and the voting interests were delivered through three separate classes
of preferred stocks (Class P, M and S Voting Preferred Stock, collectively,
"Voting Preferred Stock"). The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock was delivered
to an ESOP trust in seven separate sales under the Leveraged ESOP, the
last of which occurred on January 5, 2000. Based on Internal Revenue Code
Limitations, shares of the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock were either contributed
to the Non-Leveraged ESOP or allocated as "book entry" shares to the Supplemental
ESOP annually through the year 2000. The classes of preferred stock are
described more fully in Note 16, "ESOP Preferred Stock."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock were legally released or allocated to employee accounts as of year-end.
The final allocation of shares occurred in March 2001 effective December
31, 2000. During 2002, 88,981 shares of Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock previously
allocated in book entry form were issued and either contributed to the
qualified plan or converted and sold on behalf of terminating employees.
In addition, during 2002, State Street began converting shares as discussed
in Note 16, "ESOP Preferred Stock."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock committed to be contributed to employees under the Supplemental ESOP,
employees can elect to receive their "book entry" shares in cash upon termination
of employment. At December 31, 2002, there were 360,831 book entry shares
outstanding under the Supplemental ESOP. The estimated fair value of such
shares at December 31, 2002 and 2001 is reflected in the <u>Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position</u>.
<p><b><u>(20) Retirement and Postretirement Plans</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has various retirement
plans, both defined benefit and defined contribution, which cover substantially
all employees. The Company also provides certain health care benefits,
primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as
certain life insurance benefits to retirees. The Company has reserved the
right, subject to collective bargaining agreements, to modify or terminate
the health care and life insurance benefits for both current and future
retirees. The amounts disclosed below do not reflect the impact of any
changes to the benefit plans that might be contemplated as a result of
the bankruptcy filing or negotiations with unions under the collective
bargaining agreements.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following table sets
forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit
obligation and plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized
in the <u>Statements of Consolidated Financial Position</u> for the defined
benefit and other postretirement plans as of December 31:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes in interest rates
or rates of inflation may impact the assumptions used in the valuation
of pension obligations and postretirement obligations including discount
rates, rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation,
resulting in increases or decreases in United's pension and postretirement
liabilities and pension and postretirement costs.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pension obligation
and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced.
Lowering the discount rate by 0.5% (from 6.75% to 6.25%) would increase
the Company's pension obligation at December 31, 2002 by approximately
$820 million and increase the estimated 2003 pension expense by approximately
$85 million.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pension expense increases
as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets by 0.5% (from 9.0% to 8.5%) would
increase the estimated 2003 pension expense by approximately $40 million.
<p><b><u>(21) Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>General Guarantees
and Indemnifications. </i></b>In the normal course of business, the Company
enters into numerous real estate leasing and aircraft financing arrangements
that have various guarantees included in the contracts. These guarantees
are primarily in the form of indemnities. In both leasing and financing
transactions, the Company typically indemnifies the lessors, and any tax/financing
parties against tort liabilities that arise out of the use, occupancy,
operation or maintenance of the leased premises or financed aircraft. The
Company currently believes that any future payments required under these
guarantees or indemnities would be immaterial, as most tort liabilities
and related indemnities are covered by insurance (subject to deductibles).
Additionally, certain leased premises such as fueling stations or storage
facilities include indemnities of such parties for any environmental liability
that may arise out of or relate to the use of the leased premise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Financings and
Guarantees. </i></b>In addition to common commercial lease transactions,
United also enters into numerous long-term agreements to lease certain
airport and maintenance facilities which are financed through tax-exempt
special facilities revenue bonds and issued by various local municipalities
to build or improve airport and maintenance facilities. Under these lease
agreements, United is required to make rental payments in amounts sufficient
to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. At December
31, 2002, $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds was outstanding.
As of December 31, 2002, UAL and United had jointly guaranteed $35 million
of such bonds and United had guaranteed $1.2 billion of such bonds, including
accrued interest. The payments required to satisfy these obligations are
included in the future minimum lease payments disclosed in Note 13, "Lease
Obligations."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Third Party Guarantees.
</i></b>In
conjunction with efforts to enhance the Star Alliance, in 1999 United agreed
to guarantee a portion of third-party debt. The guarantee is set to expire
in 2009 when the loan is due in full. United's maximum exposure to the
guaranteed loan is approximately $106 million and will only trigger if
the loan is in default. No liability was recorded by United at the time
of the guarantee. United earns commitment fees on the maximum guaranteed
amount of the loan. In addition, United may also earn drawdown fees on
the outstanding loan balance based on a calculated formula, requiring the
borrower to pay the incremental difference between United's credit rating
and the borrower's. Upon drawdown on the guaranteed loan, United can seek
reimbursement of the paid amount from the borrower plus interest at the
Federal funds rate plus 2%. United has subordinate security interests on
the aircraft purchased with the loan proceeds.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Fuel Consortiums.
</i></b>United
also participates in numerous fuel consortiums with other carriers at major
airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline
agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortium members
and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortium
based on usage. The consortiums (and in limited cases, the participating
carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport
fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through
tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general
airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general,
the consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments
in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments
on the bonds. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $450 million principal
amount of such bonds are direct indebtedness of fuel consortiums at major
hubs in which United participates. United's maximum exposure is approximately
$210 million principal amount of such bonds based on United's past consortium
participation and will only trigger if the other participating carriers
or consortiums members default on their lease payments. The guarantees
are set to expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges
from 2010 to 2028. No liability was recorded by United at the time the
indirect guarantees were made.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 2003, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities" ("FIN 46") which requires the consolidation of variable interest
entities ("VIEs"), as defined. The Company is still evaluating whether
special facilities revenue bonds and fuel consortiums should be considered
VIEs under FIN 46.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>EETC Debt.</i></b>
In 1997 and 2000, United issued EETCs to refinance certain owned aircraft
and aircraft under operating leases. A portion of these proceeds are direct
obligations of United and were recognized in the <u>Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position</u> while certain proceeds were place in trusts not
owned or affiliated with United. The proceeds placed in off-balance sheet
trusts were used to refinance the remaining bank debt of the lessors in
existing leveraged leases with United. As of December 31, 2002, approximately
$300 million of these proceeds were placed in off-balance sheet trusts.
For one of the trusts, United is the swap provider and pays fixed interest
and receives variable interest which converts the trust's variable rate
assets to fixed rate assets and converts United's variable rate lease payments
to fixed rate lease payments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company is still
evaluating whether or not the EETC trusts are considered VIEs under FIN
46.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Legal and Environmental
Contingencies. </i></b>The Company has certain contingencies resulting
from litigation and claims (including environmental issues) incident to
the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after considering
a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal
counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and
its prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies
is not expected to materially affect UAL's consolidated financial position
or results of operations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL records liabilities
for legal and environmental claims against it in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. These amounts are recorded based on the
Company's assessments of the likelihood of their eventual settlements.
The amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near
term, based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims. In
addition, as a result of the bankruptcy filing, as of the Petition Date,
virtually all pending litigation is stayed, and absent further order of
the Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject to certain exceptions, may take
any action, again subject to certain exceptions, to recover on pre-petition
claims against the Debtors. Accordingly, the Company has classified certain
of these liabilities as liabilities subject to compromise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Commitments.
</i></b>At
December 31, 2002, commitments for the purchase of property and equipment,
principally aircraft, approximated $1.6 billion, after deducting advance
payments. An estimated $0.1 billion will be spent in 2003, $0.3 billion
in 2004, $0.4 billion in 2005, $0.4 billion in 2006 and $0.4 billion in
2007 and thereafter. The major commitments are for the purchase of A319,
A320 and B777 aircraft, which are currently scheduled to be delivered through
2007.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the construction
of the Indianapolis Maintenance Center, United agreed to spend an aggregate
$800 million on capital investments by the year 2001 and employ at least
7,500 individuals by the year 2004. In the event such targets are not reached,
United may be required to make certain payments to the city of Indianapolis
and state of Indiana. As a result of the events of September 11 and the
subsequent reduction in the Company's operations, headcount and capital
spending, United repaid $34 million to the state and local governments
in June of 2002 and has accrued for the additional estimated liability
for 2004.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 80% of United's
employees are represented by various labor organizations. The contracts
with ALPA and the IAM become amendable in 2004 and with the AFA in 2006.
The Company is in the process of negotiating with its labor unions to amend
the existing contracts in light of the bankruptcy filing and United's need
to cut costs. As described in Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code," Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code permits the
Company to move to reject its labor contracts. On March 17, 2003, United
filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to reject its labor contracts
pursuant to Section 1113(c) and the Company expects to obtain a ruling
on the motion by early May.
<p><b><u>(22) Financial Instruments and Risk Management</u></b>
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Derivative Financial
Instruments</i> -</b> Effective January 1, 2001, UAL adopted SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No.
133"), as amended. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a cumulative
charge of $8 million, net of tax, to 2001 earnings. This primarily related
to the changes in fair values of certain equity warrants that were not
designated as qualifying hedging instruments.
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hedges of Future Cash Flows</i>
<p><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Foreign Currency</i>
- -<b> </b>United enters into forwards and currency swaps to reduce exposure
to currency fluctuations on Japanese yen- and euro-denominated capital
lease obligations. The cash flows of the forwards and swaps mirror those
of the capital leases. These forwards and swaps have been designated as
cash flow hedges of the foreign currency denominated lease payments. For
these forwards and swaps, United excludes changes in fair value resulting
from changes in the forward points in its assessment of effectiveness.
Any gains or losses realized upon early termination of these forwards and
swaps are recorded (net of tax) as a component of other comprehensive income
and recognized in income as the hedged transaction impacts earnings. As
a result of the bankruptcy filing, all swaps and forwards were terminated
by the respective counterparties while out of the money. The outstanding
liabilities for these swaps and forwards are recorded as liabilities subject
to compromise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company hedges some of
the risks of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future Japanese
yen, euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound revenues
by purchasing put options and on Hong Kong dollar revenues by entering
into forward contracts. These options and forwards have a duration of less
than one year and the amounts are synchronized with the expected cash receipts.
Accordingly, the put options and forwards have been designated as cash
flow hedges of the anticipated cash receipts. Changes in the fair value
of purchased put option contracts, to the extent they are effective, are
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (net of tax) and
then recognized as a component of passenger revenue when the underlying
hedged revenue is recorded. United excludes, in its assessment of effectiveness,
changes in the fair value of these instruments that are a result of changes
in their time value. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has no outstanding
currency hedges.
<p><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Aircraft Fuel </i>-
From time to time, United uses crude oil and heating oil forwards and options
to hedge a portion of its price risk related to aircraft fuel purchases.
These contracts have maturity dates of less than two years and have been
designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated jet fuel purchases. These
contracts are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value, to
the extent they are effective, recorded in other comprehensive income (net
of tax), until the underlying hedged fuel is consumed. The Company determines
the ineffective portion of the fuel forwards and options as the change
in the fair value of the hedge contracts compared to the change in expected
cash outflows for the hedged jet fuel. United excludes, in its assessment
of effectiveness, changes in the fair value of these instruments that are
a result of changes in their time value. As a result of the bankruptcy
filing, all fuel hedges were terminated by the respective counterparties.
The gain that resulted from the early termination of the hedges is recorded
as a component of other comprehensive income and will be reclassified into
earnings in the period of the original maturity of the hedges.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Interest Rate - </i>United
is a party to a series of interest rate swaps that convert floating-rate
operating leases to fixed-rate leases. United has designated these swaps
as cash flow hedges of the floating-rate leases and has recorded these
contracts at fair value with the effective portion recorded as a component
of other comprehensive income (net of tax). As of December 31, 2002, United
had $130 million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding with
a fair value to United of $(27) million.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ineffectiveness resulting
from the changes in fair value of aircraft fuel and interest rate hedge
positions was immaterial. There was no ineffectiveness resulting from the
changes in fair value of foreign currency hedge positions reported in earnings.
Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness amounted to approximately
$1 million before income taxes and were recorded in "Miscellaneous, net."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a reconciliation
of current period changes of the portion of stockholders' equity relating
to derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges:

</table></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this amount, $5 million
in losses is expected to be recorded into earnings within the next twelve
months. At December 31, 2002, the term of derivative instruments hedging
variability in cash flows, except those related to payment of variable
interest on existing financial instruments, was sixteen years.
<p><i>Other Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Foreign Currency - </i>From
time to time, United enters into Japanese yen forward exchange contracts
to minimize gains and losses on the revaluation of short-term yen-denominated
liabilities. The yen forwards, typically having short-term maturities,
are not designated hedges under SFAS No. 133 and are marked to fair value
through the income statement at the end of each accounting period. The
unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses generally offset the losses
and gains recorded on the yen liabilities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce hedging costs,
the Company sells a correlation option denominated in Japanese yen, euros,
Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds. These correlation
options are not designated as a hedge and the changes in the fair market
value of the correlation options are included in "Miscellaneous, net."
<p><b><u>(23) Segment Information</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first quarter
of 2002, the Company made changes to its corporate structure which resulted
in substantially all of UAL's customer loyalty and on-line travel marketing
programs (which were previously the responsibility of United) becoming
owned and operated by ULS. ULS had been United's agent to market and sell
Mileage Plus miles to non-airline business partners beginning in October
of 2000. In the first quarter of 2002, ULS assumed direct responsibility
for these relationships rather than as an agent of United. The above changes
were designed to increase the overall value of UAL's loyalty businesses
by focusing management attention on these activities and enhancing the
range of products and services offered to Mileage Plus members and business
partners. United remains responsible for all Mileage Plus airline partnerships
and the setting of airline mileage accruals and award levels and airline-related
loyalty recognition levels. As both United and ULS remain wholly owned
subsidiaries of UAL, there is no impact to UAL's consolidated results of
operations or statements of financial position for these transactions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the
transactions described in the previous paragraph, the Company has adjusted
its segment reporting structure. UAL now has five reportable segments which
reflect the current management of the business: North America, the Pacific,
the Atlantic and Latin America which are part of United, and ULS. Prior
year information has been restated to reflect the change to UAL's reportable
segments; however, the 2001 and 2000 information does not reflect the change
in arrangements between United and ULS which occurred in the first quarter
of 2002.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with
DOT guidelines, the Company allocates passenger and cargo revenues for
the North America segment based on the actual flown revenue for flights
with an origin and destination in the U.S. Passenger and cargo revenue
for international segments is based on the actual flown revenue for flights
with an origin or destination in that segment. Other revenues that are
not directly associated with a flight (such as Red Carpet Club membership
fees) are allocated based on available seat miles flown in that segment.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accounting policies
for each of these segments are the same as those described in Note 2, "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies," except that segment financial information
has been prepared using a management approach which is consistent with
how the Company's management internally disperses financial information
for the purpose of making internal operating decisions. UAL evaluates performance
based on earnings before income taxes, special charges and gains on sales.
A reconciliation of the total amounts reported by reportable segments to
the applicable amounts in the consolidated financial statements follows:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL's operations involve
an insignificant level of dedicated revenue producing assets by reportable
segment. The overwhelming majority of United's revenue producing assets
can be deployed in any of the four reportable segments, as any given aircraft
may be used in multiple segments on any given day. Therefore, United allocates
depreciation and amortization expense associated with those assets on the
basis of available seat miles flown in each segment. In addition, UAL has
significant intangible assets related to the acquisition of its Atlantic
and Latin America route authorities. ULS has $379 million in total assets
as of December 31, 2002.

<p><b>ITEM 11.&nbsp; EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.</b>
<p><b><u>Director Compensation</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL does not pay its directors
who are also employees of UAL additional compensation for their services
as directors.&nbsp; In 2002, compensation for non-employee directors included
the following:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; </b>annual
retainer of $18,000;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; </b>$900 for
each board and board committee meeting attended;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; </b>annual retainer
of $2,700 to committee chairmen (other than chair of Compensation Administration
Committee); the chairs of the CAP and Transaction Committees were only
paid for the quarters in which the Committees were active;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; </b>expenses
of attending board and committee meetings;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; </b>400 shares
of common stock; and
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; </b>189 deferred
stock units representing common stock.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Under the Company's stock
ownership guidelines, it is recommended that UAL directors keep the 400
shares they receive each year while they serve are on the Board.&nbsp;
They may also elect to receive some or all of their cash retainers and
fees in UAL common stock, as well as to defer their stock and cash compensation
for tax purposes.&nbsp; The deferred stock units are unfunded and are settled
in shares of UAL common stock after the director leaves the Board.
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>UAL considers it important
for its directors to understand UAL's business and have exposure to UAL's
operations and employees.&nbsp; For this reason, UAL provides free transportation
and free cargo shipment on United to its directors and their spouses and
eligible dependent children.&nbsp; UAL reimburses its directors for federal
and state income taxes resulting from actual use of the travel and shipment
privileges.&nbsp; A director who retires from the Board with at least five
years of UAL creditable service will receive free travel, subject to certain
exceptions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of this policy in
2002 for each director, including cash payments made in January and October
2002 for income tax liability, was as follows:

<b><u>Option Grants in 2002</u></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The table below provides
information about stock options that UAL granted during 2002 to the officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table.&nbsp; The hypothetical present
values of stock options granted in 2002 are calculated under a modified
Black-Scholes model, a mathematical formula used to value options.&nbsp;
The actual amount realized upon exercise of stock options will depend upon
the amount by which the market price of common stock on the date of exercise
is greater than the exercise price.&nbsp; The officers will not be able
to realize a gain from the stock options granted unless, during the exercise
period, the market price of common stock exceeds the exercise price of
the options.

</table></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This table is based on retirement
at age 65 and selection of a straight life annuity (other annuity options
are available, which would reduce the amounts shown).&nbsp; The amount
of the normal retirement benefit under the plan is the product of 1.63%
times years of credited participation in the plan times final average pay
(highest five of last ten years of covered compensation).&nbsp; The retirement
benefit amount is not offset by the participant's social security benefit.<font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
Compensation used in calculating benefits under the plan includes base
salary and amounts shown as bonus in the Summary Compensation Table.&nbsp;
Under the qualified plan, years of participation for persons named in the
compensation table are as follows: Mr. Studdert - 7 years; Ms. Maher -
9 years; Mr. Hacker - 9 years; Mr. Brace - 14 years; Mr. Dutta - 17 years;
Mr. McDonald - 31 years.&nbsp; Mr. Tilton, who joined UAL in September
of 2002, is not eligible to participate in the Company's qualified plan
until October 1, 2003.&nbsp; The amounts shown do not reflect limitations
imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on retirement benefits that may be
paid under plans qualified under the code.&nbsp; United has agreed to provide
under non-qualified plans the portion of the retirement benefits earned
under the pension plan that would otherwise be subject to code limitations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the Company's
recent Chapter 11 filing, UAL is currently considering the adoption of
one pension plan for all of the Company's officers and employees.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Mr. Hacker is employed
until age 50, he will be credited with additional years of participation
so that his total years of participation will equal 25.4 years.&nbsp; In
addition, if he is employed during the period between the date he attains
age 50 and the date he attains age 55, he will be credited with an additional
month of participation for each month of participation credited to him
during that period.&nbsp; If he remains employed past age 55, he will be
credited an additional 1/2 month of participation for each month of participation
credited to him after age 55.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dutta and Mr. Studdert
continued to receive participation credit through February 15, 2003.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the hiring
of Mr. Tilton, UAL agreed to provide a pension make-whole payment, which
is described below.
<p><b><u>Employment Contracts and Arrangements</u></b>
<p><b><u>Mr. Tilton's Employment Agreement</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tilton was elected Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of UAL effective September 2, 2002.&nbsp;
The Company entered into a five-year employment agreement with Mr. Tilton
effective September 5, 2002, which agreement was amended on December 8,
2002 and again on February 17, 2003 in connection with the Company's bankruptcy
filing.&nbsp; The amended agreement provides for an annual base salary
of $845,500 (which reflects an 11% reduction from the original amount),
and is subject to increases as part of the normal salary program for the
Company's senior executives.&nbsp; The agreement provides Mr. Tilton a
$3 million signing bonus, which Mr. Tilton will be required to repay if
he voluntarily resigns other than for good reason or UAL terminates him
for cause on or before the earlier of June 1, 2004 or the date a plan of
reorganization is approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the terms of the agreement,
Mr. Tilton also received options to purchase 1,150,000 shares of UAL common
stock.&nbsp; The exercise price for the options is $3.03, which was the
average of the high and low sales price of the common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange on August 30 and September 3, 2002.&nbsp; The options
expire on September 1, 2012.&nbsp; The Company also agreed to reimburse
Mr. Tilton for his and his family's relocation expenses, including a cash
payment to cover his income tax liability for the relocation reimbursement.&nbsp;
Under his employment agreement, Mr. Tilton is eligible to receive an annual
incentive bonus with a target percentage equal to 100% of his base salary.&nbsp;
He is entitled to an additional 100% over this target bonus amount for
superior performance.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Mr. Tilton's employment
is terminated by UAL without "cause," or by him for "good reason," or if
there is a "change in control," UAL will pay him his base salary as reduced
by the December 8<sup>th</sup> amendment, any annual bonus and any earned
and vested benefits he may be entitled to through the termination date.&nbsp;
UAL will also pay Mr. Tilton a lump sum payment equal to his base salary
reduced by the December 8<sup>th</sup> amendment and target bonus multiplied
by the greater of (1) the remaining term of his agreement or (2) three
years.&nbsp; Mr. Tilton's other benefits will be continued for this period.&nbsp;
All long-term incentive awards will immediately vest on the termination
date, including any unvested stock options or restricted stock awards.&nbsp;
Under Mr. Tilton's agreement, a "change of control" is defined as: (1)
a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all the Company's assets
in which the voting securities of the Company immediately before the merger,
consolidation or sale represent less than 80% of the voting power after
the merger, consolidation or sale; (2) the acquisition by a person or group
of 25% or more of the voting securities of the Company; (3) the UAL shareholders
approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation of the Company; (4) a
change in the majority of the Board over a 24-month period (unless the
new directors were approved by a two-thirds majority of prior directors);
or (5) any other event or transaction that the Board of Directors determines
is a change of control.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A "change of control" will
generally not arise as a result of events occurring prior to or on account
of a plan of reorganization of the Company under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, unless (1) there is a merger with another commercial airline and
the holders of the claims and/or interests in the Company before the merger
have less than 80% of the combined voting power after the merger; or (2)
creditors of the Company with an intent to control the management and policies
of the Company on an on-going basis acquire at least 25% of the voting
securities of the Company; or (3) a sale of the assets of the Company to
another commercial airline, unless the creditors and/or interest holders
in the Company receive, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the combined
voting power of the acquirer.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In consideration of projected
retirement benefits foregone by Mr. Tilton as a result of his resignation
from his prior employer and acceptance of UAL's employment offer, $4.5
million was paid into three secular trusts on Mr. Tilton's behalf subject
to ratable vesting over three years.&nbsp; The non-vested portion is to
be forfeited and returned to UAL if Mr. Tilton voluntarily terminates employment
for other than good reason or is terminated for cause.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 21, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court approved UAL's motion to assume Mr. Tilton's amended employment
agreement.
<p><b><u>Mr. Creighton's Retirement Arrangements</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with Mr. Creighton's
retirement in 2002, UAL agreed that he would remain as an on-call employee
of United through year-end 2002.&nbsp; Although Mr. Creighton did not receive
a salary and bonus, he received benefits, including medical, dental and
life insurance, through December 31, 2002.&nbsp; He also received a one-time
cash payment of $250,000 as consideration for his services.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Mr. Creighton's
temporary living expenses while working at UAL's headquarters in Chicago,
including the cost of a temporary residence (which could not exceed $3,000
per month) and a per diem allowance, continued to be paid by UAL through
November 2002.&nbsp; Through October 2002, UAL also provided Mr. Creighton
with office space located in the vicinity of his personal residence in
Seattle to be used primarily for UAL business while he was staying at his
personal residence.&nbsp; The reimbursement for this office space was limited
to $3,000 per month.
<p><b><u>Mr. Studdert's Agreement</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL and Mr. Andrew Studdert
recently entered into an agreement regarding Mr. Studdert's recent termination
as an executive officer of UAL.&nbsp; Under the terms of the agreement,
Mr. Studdert will remain an on-call employee of UAL and will receive $1,000
per month through September 2004 unless the agreement is terminated earlier.&nbsp;
During the term of the agreement, Mr. Studdert will continue to provide
services for UAL if UAL reasonably requests such services.&nbsp; Mr. Studdert
will continue to receive the transportation benefit that UAL provides to
its executive officers, as well as other health and insurance benefits.&nbsp;
Mr. Studdert has agreed to forfeit all vested and unvested stock options
granted under UAL's equity incentive plans as well as any unvested restricted
stock.&nbsp; The agreement and Mr. Studdert's employment will terminate
prior to September 2004 if Mr. Studdert voluntarily terminates his employment
or, without the Company's consent, accepts a position with a competitor
of United or he otherwise breaches the agreement.
<p><b><u>Mr. Dutta's Agreement</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UAL and Mr. Rono Dutta recently
entered into an agreement regarding Mr. Dutta's recent termination as an
executive officer of UAL.&nbsp; Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Dutta
will remain an on-call employee of UAL and will receive $2,000 per month
through September 2004 unless the agreement is terminated earlier.&nbsp;
During the term of the agreement, Mr. Dutta will continue to provide services
for UAL if UAL reasonably requests such services.&nbsp; Mr. Dutta will
continue to receive the transportation benefit that United provides to
its executive officers, as well as other health and insurance benefits.&nbsp;
Mr. Dutta has agreed to forfeit all vested and unvested stock options granted
under UAL's equity incentive plans as well as any unvested restricted stock.&nbsp;
The agreement and Mr. Dutta's employment will terminate prior to September
2004 if Mr. Dutta voluntarily terminates his employment or, without the
Company's consent, accepts a position with a competitor of United or he
otherwise breaches the agreement. UAL has consented to Mr. Dutta serving
on the board of directors of US Airways and to him serving as a consultant
to an investment banking firm that may represent the American Airlines
creditors' committee in the event that airline were to file for bankruptcy
protection.

<b><u>1995 Directors Plan</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the 1995 Directors
Plan, each outside director is granted 400 shares of common stock and 189
deferred stock units (each unit representing the right to receive a share
of common stock at a future date) during each year that he or she is an
outside director of UAL.&nbsp; If any outside director is not a director
for the entire calendar year, such director's award of deferred stock units
will be prorated.&nbsp; Each outside director may elect to forego the receipt
of all or any portion of cash fees payable to him or her for service as
a director (i.e., meeting fees and committee fees) and instead receive
shares of common stock equivalent in value to the cash fees based on the
fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the cash fee is
payable to the director.&nbsp; The outside directors may also elect to
defer the receipt of cash fees payable to the director as well as the stock
award and the deferred stock units to be granted to the director in any
year, which deferral may be paid after the director leaves the Board, either
as a lump sum or in ten or less annual payments.&nbsp; The 1995 Directors
Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 400,000 shares of common stock (either
through use of treasury shares or open market purchases) and, as of December
31, 2002, 41,372 shares remained available for future awards.
<p><b><u>2002 Share Incentive Plan</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2002 Share Incentive
Plan permits the award of nonqualified stock options and restricted shares
to participants as well as stock appreciation rights.&nbsp; The exercise
price of a nonqualified stock option cannot be less than the fair market
value of a share of UAL common stock on the date of grant and the exercise
period cannot exceed ten years.&nbsp; Restricted shares issued under the
2002 Share Incentive Plan vest over a time period established by the applicable
committee (not to exceed ten years) and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior to vesting.&nbsp;
In addition, the Compensation Committee or the Compensation Administration
Committee may grant to participants other awards, including dividends and
dividend equivalents and other awards that are valued in whole or part
by reference to, or are otherwise based on, the fair market value of shares
of UAL common stock.&nbsp; The 2002 Share Incentive Plan authorizes the
issuance of 12,500,000 shares of common stock as well as 267,366 shares
that were available for issuance as awards under the 1998 Restricted Stock
Plan as of July 31, 2002 and, as of December 31, 2002, approximately 11,942,366
shares remained available for future awards under the 2002 Share Incentive
Plan.&nbsp; Only treasury shares may be issued under the 2002 Share Incentive
Plan.&nbsp; The terms of the 2002 Share Incentive Plan also provides that
any shares awarded under the 1998 Restricted Stock Plan or the 2002 Share
Incentive Plan that are subsequently forfeited, expired or canceled without
the delivery of shares of common stock or withheld by UAL to satisfy any
applicable tax withholding obligations will be available again for issuance
under the plan.
<p><b><u>Gerald Greenwald Option Shares</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 12, 1994, UAL entered
into an employment agreement with Gerald Greenwald, UAL's then Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer.&nbsp; Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Greenwald
received options to acquire 800,000 shares of UAL common stock (post-stock
split).&nbsp; The exercise price for the options is $22.53, which was the
fair market value for the UAL common stock on July 12, 1994.&nbsp; The
options were to vest over a five-year period, but vested earlier in connection
with the termination of Mr. Greenwald's employment with UAL.&nbsp; To date,
all 800,000 of the options received by Mr. Greenwald are outstanding.&nbsp;
The options are due to expire on July 11, 2004.
<p><b><u>United Employees Performance Incentive Plan</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the terms of the United
Employees Performance Incentive Plan (referred to as PIP), participants
may receive additional cash compensation if the Company meets specified
performance criteria and the employee's individual performance warrants
additional compensation.&nbsp; Prior to the beginning of each year, the
Company's Compensation Committee establishes a threshold level of pre-tax
profit margin that the Company must obtain before any award may be made
under the PIP for that year.&nbsp; The Compensation Committee also determines
the appropriate individual performance objectives for each year that are
related to specified areas, including financial performance, operational
performance or customer satisfaction.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the PIP, an incentive
award is typically paid in cash following the end of a calendar year; however,
certain key employees are allowed to elect to defer receipt of their incentive
award and can elect to receive their deferred incentive award in UAL common
stock (treasury shares or shares purchased in the open market).&nbsp; The
amount of the stock to be paid to each employee is equal to the amount
of the incentive award divided by the fair market value of the stock (using
a five-day average share price) determined as of the date the incentive
award would have been paid in cash but for the deferral election.&nbsp;
Under the PIP, any employee who defers his or her receipt of the incentive
award for five or more years will also be credited with an additional amount
equal to the 20% of the incentive award.&nbsp; The Compensation Administration
Committee administers the plan with respect to any "officer" as defined
in the Exchange Act rules and the Compensation Committee administers the
plan with respect to all other participants.&nbsp; There is no fixed number
of shares available for issuance under this plan.&nbsp; In 2000, UAL's
shareholders approved the portion of the PIP relating to any "covered award"
that could result in the application of Section 162(m) of the Code.

<p><b>ITEM 14.&nbsp; CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the 90-day period
prior to the filing of this report, an evaluation was carried out under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer
("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures.&nbsp; Based on that evaluation, the Company's CEO and CFO have
concluded that UAL's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.&nbsp; Subsequent to
the date of their evaluation, there were no significant changes in UAL's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the
disclosure controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses.

interest rates), declare that no Loan may be made as, converted into or
continued as a Eurodollar Loan.&nbsp; During the continuance of a Default,
Agent or the Required Lenders may, at their option, by written notice to

(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Lender may request that its Loan be evidenced

Loan and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender
for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.
<p>2.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent</u>.&nbsp;
Unless the Borrower notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of a payment of principal, interest
or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend
to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been made.&nbsp;
The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment
available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.&nbsp;
If the Borrower has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient
of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount
so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day
during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available
by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per

<p>2.19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Replacement of Lender</u>.&nbsp; If the Borrower
is required pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional
payment to any Lender or if any Lender's obligation to make or continue,
or to convert Floating Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended
pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender so affected an "Affected Lender"),
the Borrower may elect with the consent of Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld; provided that it shall not be deemed unreasonable
for Agent to withhold its consent if the Loan and this facility have not
been fully syndicated (as determined by Agent in its sole discretion)),
if such amounts continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective,
to replace such Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, <i>provided</i>
that no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
replacement, and <i>provided further</i> that, concurrently with such replacement,
(i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash
the Loan and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an
assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit A and to become a Lender
for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of
the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with
the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the
Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender in same day funds on the day
of such replacement (A) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued
but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including
the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such
Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if
any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the
day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loan of such Affected
Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.
<p>2.20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Approval of Interest</u>.&nbsp; Approval of
this Agreement by the Bankruptcy Court shall constitute approval of the
rates of interest and other amounts payable hereunder and a ruling that
they are exempt from any otherwise applicable limitation.

times be senior to the rights of any Credit Party, any Credit Party's estate,

Code, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $35,000,000 (the "Carve-Out

<i>in toto</i> to be allocated pro rata among the Obligations
hereunder and the obligations under the Additional DIP Credit Agreement,
plus amounts payable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1930(a)(6) and to the
Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court; <i>provided</i>, that any payments actually
made to such professionals under Sections 330, 331 and 503 of the Bankruptcy
Code in respect of fees and expenses incurred or accrued (x) prior to the
occurrence of a Default, shall not reduce the Carve Out Reserve and (y)
from and after the occurrence of a Default, shall reduce dollar-for-dollar
the Carve Out Reserve; <i>provided</i>,
<i>further</i>, that in no event
shall any of the Carve Out Reserve include any fees or expenses arising
after the conversion of the Chapter 11 Case to a case under Chapter 7 of
the Bankruptcy Code.&nbsp; In the event of a liquidation of the Borrower's
and the Credit Parties' estates, the amount of the Carve-Out Reserve shall
be funded into a segregated account prior to the making of any distributions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Credit Parties shall be permitted to
pay, as the same may become due and payable, subject to the provisions
of the Orders and this Section 2.21 and provided that no Default has occurred
and is continuing, compensation and reimbursement of expenses to professionals

of the Bankruptcy Code, <i>provided</i> that&nbsp; the Credit Parties shall
not be permitted to use cash collateral of Lenders or Additional DIP Lenders
or the proceeds of Loan made hereunder or under the Additional DIP to pay
any amount in professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the investigation (including discovery proceedings) of potential claims,
causes of action, actions or proceedings against (i) Agent or any Lender
in respect of the Obligations or otherwise or (ii) the Additional DIP Lenders
in respect of obligations owing under the Additional DIP Credit Agreement.&nbsp;
Except for the Carve-Out Reserve and payments under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1930(a)(6)
and to the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court, no costs or expenses of administration
shall be imposed against Agent and Lenders or the Collateral under Sections

with its Eurodollar Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending
Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount
of Eurodollar Loans held or interest received by it, in each case by an
amount deemed material by such Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing
is to increase the cost to such Lender or applicable Lending Installation
of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or Commitment or to reduce
the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending Installation in
connection with such Eurodollar Loans or Commitment, then, within 15 days
of written demand (together with reasonable documentation supporting such
reimbursement request) by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
increased cost or reduction in amount received.

3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations</u>.&nbsp;
If a Lender reasonably determines the amount of capital required or expected
to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender
or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of
a Change, then, within 15 days of written demand (together with reasonable
documentation supporting such reimbursement request) by such Lender, the
Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any
shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital

Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition
rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the date
of this Agreement.
<p>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Availability of Types of Loan</u>.&nbsp; If
any Lender reasonably determines that maintenance of a Eurodollar Loans
at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law, rule,
regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force of law, or if
the Required Lenders reasonably determine that (i) deposits of a type and
maturity appropriate to match fund the Eurodollar Loan is not available
or (ii) the interest rate applicable to the Eurodollar Loan does not accurately
reflect the cost of making or maintaining the Eurodollar Loan, then the
Agent shall suspend the availability of the Eurodollar Loan and require
any affected Eurodollar Loan to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate
Loan, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required
by Section 3.4.
<p>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Funding Indemnification</u>.&nbsp; If any payment
of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a date which is not the last day of the
applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment
or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Loan is not made on the date specified by
the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, the Borrower
will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting
therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating
or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Eurodollar Loan.

any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (a) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 3.5) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (b) the Borrower or the other applicable Credit Party shall make
such deductions, (c) the Borrower or the other applicable Credit Party
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in accordance
with applicable law and (d) the Borrower or the other applicable Credit
Party shall furnish to the Agent the original copy of a receipt (to the
extent reasonably available) evidencing payment thereof within 30 days
after such payment is made.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Borrower
hereby agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and
any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise
from any payment made hereunder or under any Note or from the execution
or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note
("Other Taxes").
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrower hereby agrees
to indemnify the Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or
Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
on amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Agent or such Lender
as a result of its Commitment, any Loan made by it hereunder, or otherwise
in connection with its participation in this Agreement and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto.&nbsp; Payments due under this indemnification shall be
made within 30 days of the date the Agent or such Lender makes written
demand (together with reasonable documentation supporting such reimbursement
request) therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws
of the United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender")
agrees that it will, not more than ten Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, (i) deliver to the Agent two duly completed copies of United
States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, certifying in either
case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement
without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes,
and (ii) deliver to the Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form W-8
or W-9, as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an exemption
from United States backup withholding tax.&nbsp; Each Non-U.S. Lender further
undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent (x) renewals
or additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or before
the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so
delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments thereto as may be
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent.&nbsp; All forms or amendments
described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes, <i>unless</i> an event (including
without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred
prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required
which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender
from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment with respect
to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not
capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United
States federal income tax.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For any period during which
a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide the Borrower with an appropriate
form pursuant to clause (iv), above (unless such failure is due to a change
in treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date
on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S.
Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5
with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States;
<i>provided</i> that,
should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a
reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes because of its
failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv), above, the Borrower
shall take such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request
to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Lender that is entitled
to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments
under this Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction
or any treaty shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent),
at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed
and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit
such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service or any other governmental authority of the United States or any
other country or any political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that
the Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the
account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or
properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify the Agent of a
change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective,
or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Agent fully for
all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax, withholding
therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including
taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Agent under
this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related thereto (including
reasonable attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent,
which attorneys may be employees of the Agent).&nbsp; The obligations of
the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the
Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
<p>3.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity</u>.&nbsp;
To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate
Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any
liability of the Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5
or to avoid the unavailability of a Eurodollar Loan under Section 3.3,
so long as such designation is not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.&nbsp; Each Lender shall deliver
a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5.&nbsp;
Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations
upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.&nbsp; Determination
of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar
Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan
through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding
to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable
to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.&nbsp; Unless otherwise
provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender
shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written
statement.&nbsp; The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2,
3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of
this Agreement.

Court, the execution and delivery by the Credit Parties of the Loan Documents
and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized
by proper corporate or other organizational proceedings, and the Loan Documents

Court, no order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization,
or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption
by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority,

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Financial
Statements</u>.&nbsp; The Borrower has furnished the Lenders with copies
of the audited consolidated financial statement and schedules of the Parent
and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and the
unaudited consolidated financial statements for the Parent and&nbsp; its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2002.&nbsp; Such
financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial
condition and results of operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis as of such dates and for such periods; such balance
sheets and the notes thereto disclose all liabilities, direct or contingent,
of the Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof required to
be disclosed by Agreement Accounting Principles and such financial statements
were prepared in a manner consistent with Agreement Accounting Principles.&nbsp;
No material adverse change in the operations, business, properties, assets,
prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, has occurred from the date set forth in the Parent's
and its Subsidiaries' financial statements for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2001 and the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2002 other than those
occurring as a result of events leading up to and following the commencement
of a proceeding under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and the commencement
of the Chapter 11 Cases.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Material
Adverse Change</u>.&nbsp; Other than the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases,
since December 31, 2001 there has been no change in the business, Property,
prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Taxes</u>.&nbsp;
The Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed all United States federal tax
returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have
paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment
received by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except such taxes, if
any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves
have been provided in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles and
as to which no Lien exists.&nbsp; The United States income tax returns
of the Parent and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue
Service through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001.&nbsp; No tax liens
have been filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such
taxes.&nbsp; The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Parent
and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges
are adequate.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Litigation
and Contingent Obligations</u>.&nbsp; There is no action, litigation, arbitration,
governmental investigation, suit, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting
the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or
which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of any Loan.&nbsp; The
Borrower is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Parent.&nbsp; Other than any
liability incident to any litigation, arbitration or proceeding which could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no Credit
Party has material contingent obligations not provided for or disclosed
in the financial statements referred to in Section 5.4.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Subsidiaries</u>.&nbsp;
Schedule 5.8 contains an accurate list of all Subsidiaries of each Credit
Party as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth their respective
jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their respective capital
stock or other ownership interests owned by each Credit Party or other
Subsidiaries.&nbsp; All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock or other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the
extent such concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership interests)
duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.&nbsp;
Except for changes in ownership permitted by this Agreement, the Borrower
is a direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Parent and the Parent owns no
other Subsidiaries, whether directly or indirectly, other than the Borrower,
the Credit Parties (other than the Parent) and other than as listed on
Schedule 5.8 (which shall be updated, on a quarterly basis, to reflect
changes in ownership permitted by this Agreement).&nbsp; Other than as
set forth on Schedule 5.8, (i) each of the Persons listed on Schedule 5.8
is a wholly-owned, direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Borrower, and (ii)
the Borrower owns no other Subsidiaries, whether directly or indirectly.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Intentionally
Deleted.</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.10&nbsp; <u>Statements
Made</u>.&nbsp; The information that has been delivered in writing by the
Borrower or any of the Credit Parties to the Lenders or to the Bankruptcy
Court in connection with any Loan Document, and any financial statement
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto (other than to the extent that any
such statements constitute projections), taken as a whole and in light
of the circumstances in which made, contains no untrue statement of a material
fact and does not omit to state a material fact necessary to make such
statements not misleading; and, to the extent that any such information
constitutes projections, such projections were prepared in good faith on
the basis of assumptions, methods, data, tests and information believed
by the Borrower or such Credit Party to be reasonable at the time such
projections were furnished (it being understood that projections by their
nature are inherently uncertain, that no assurances can be given that projections

request of the Requisite Lenders shall), notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code but subject to any provision of the
Interim Order or Final Order, without any application, motion or notice
to, or order from, the Bankruptcy Court, terminate or suspend the obligations
of the Lenders to make a Loan hereunder, or declare the Obligations to
be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any

<br>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>
The Agent, on behalf of the secured parties, may comply with any applicable
state or federal law requirements in connection with a disposition of the
Collateral and compliance will not be considered to adversely affect the
commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.

(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the request of the Agent after the occurrence

Borrower and each other Credit Party hereby waives notice of the time and
place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale or other
disposition of all or any part of the Collateral may be made.&nbsp; To
the extent such notice may not be waived under applicable law, any notice
made shall be deemed reasonable if sent to the Borrower or other applicable
Credit Party, addressed as set forth in Section 13.1, at least ten days
prior to (i) the date of any such public sale or (ii) the time after which
any such private sale or other disposition may be made.&nbsp; Agent shall

other Credit Party for such use and occupancy.

Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2, the Required Lenders (or
the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the
Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose
of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving
any Default hereunder; <i>provided, however</i>, that no such supplemental
agreement shall, without the consent of all of the Lenders:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extend the final maturity of any Loan, postpone
or reduce the mandatory Commitment reductions set forth in Section 2.2(a)
hereof, forgive all or any portion of the principal amount thereof, or

of Required Lenders.
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extend the Facility Termination Date or increase

or substantially all of the Collateral.
<br>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendments, modifications or waivers
to the covenants set forth in Section 6.35 shall be deemed given or made
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Lenders and Additional
DIP Lenders holding more than 50% of the sum of (a) the Aggregate Commitment
and (b) the outstanding commitments and/or exposure under the Additional
DIP.&nbsp; No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to
the Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Agent.&nbsp;
The Agent may waive payment of the fee required under Section 12.3.3 without
obtaining the consent of any other party to this Agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Preservation
of Rights</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No delay or omission of the Lenders or
the Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence
therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default
or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to
such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.&nbsp; Any single
or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment
or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents
whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required
pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically
set forth.&nbsp; All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law
afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Agent and
the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full.

<br><b><u>THE AGENT</u></b></center>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Appointment;
Nature of Relationship</u>.&nbsp; Bank One, NA is hereby appointed by each
of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as
the "Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of
the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set
forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.&nbsp; The Agent agrees to
act as such contractual representative upon the express conditions contained
in this Article X.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent,"
it is expressly understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any
fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual
representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set
forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.&nbsp; In its capacity
as the Lenders' contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not hereby
assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative"
of the Lenders within the meaning of the term "secured party" as defined
in the Illinois UCC and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor, the
rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.&nbsp; Each of the Lenders
hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Agent on any agency theory
or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which
claims each Lender hereby waives.&nbsp; Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each Lender hereby authorizes Bank One, NA to consent,
on behalf of such Lender, to an Interim Order substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit D hereto and a Final Order substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit E hereto.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Powers</u>.&nbsp;
The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the Loan Documents
as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each thereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.&nbsp; The
Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to
the Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically
provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>General
Immunity</u>.&nbsp; Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, any Credit Party,
the Lenders or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection
herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is determined
in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction
to have arisen from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Person.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>No
Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc</u>.&nbsp; Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible
for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement,
warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or
any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information
directly to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified
in Article IV, except receipt of items required to be delivered solely
to the Agent; (d) the existence or possible existence of any Default or
Unmatured Default; (e) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency
or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing
furnished in connection therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation,
perfection or priority of any Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the
financial condition of the Borrower, the other Credit Parties or any guarantor
of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrower's, the other Credit
Parties' or any such guarantor's respective Subsidiaries.&nbsp; The Agent
shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required
to be furnished by the Borrower to the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily
furnished by the Borrower to the Agent (either in its capacity as Agent
or in its individual capacity).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Action
on Instructions of Lenders</u>.&nbsp; The Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under
any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed
by the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.&nbsp;
The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to
take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall
be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.&nbsp; The Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder
and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified
to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability,
cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Employment
of Agents and Counsel</u>.&nbsp; The Agent may execute any of its duties
as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees,
agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders,
except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents,
for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected
by it with reasonable care.&nbsp; The Agent shall be entitled to advice
of counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and
the Lenders and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder
and under any other Loan Document.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Reliance
on Documents; Counsel</u>.&nbsp; The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement,
paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which
counsel may be employees of the Agent.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Agent's
Reimbursement and Indemnification</u>.&nbsp; The Lenders agree to reimburse
and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments
(or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments
immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not reimbursed
by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the
Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred
by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent
in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between
two or more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses
or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or
arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection
therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including, without
limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent
in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between
two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of
the Loan Documents or of any such other documents,
<i>provided that</i>
(i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any
of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court
of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required
pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions
thereof.&nbsp; The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall
survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Notice
of Default</u>.&nbsp; The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder
unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured Default
and stating that such notice is a "notice of default".&nbsp; In the event
that the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Lenders.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.10&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Rights
as a Lender</u>.&nbsp; In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent shall
have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan Document
with respect to its Commitment and its Loan as any Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders"
shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context otherwise
indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity.&nbsp; The Agent
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally
engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition
to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with
the Borrower, any other Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries in which
the Borrower, any other Credit Party or such Subsidiary is not restricted
hereby from engaging with any other Person.&nbsp; The Agent, in its individual
capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Lender
Credit Decision</u>.&nbsp; Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently
and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and
based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and the other
Credit Parties and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.&nbsp; Each Lender also acknowledges
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger
or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Successor
Agent</u>.&nbsp; The Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice
thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective
upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent has
been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of
its intention to resign.&nbsp; The Agent may be removed at any time with
or without cause by written notice received by the Agent from the Required
Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the Required
Lenders.&nbsp; Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders
shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders,
a successor Agent.&nbsp; If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Agent's
giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may
appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any time without
the consent of the Borrower or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates
which is a commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder.&nbsp; If the
Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Agent has been appointed,
the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Borrower
shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable
Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders.&nbsp;
No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such
successor Agent has accepted the appointment.&nbsp; Any such successor
Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of
at least $100,000,000.&nbsp; Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the resigning or removed Agent.&nbsp; Upon the effectiveness
of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or removed Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under
the Loan Documents.&nbsp; After the effectiveness of the resignation or
removal of an Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in
effect for the benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents.&nbsp; In the event that there is a successor
to the Agent by merger, or the Agent assigns its duties and obligations
to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate"
as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other
analogous rate of the new Agent.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Agent
and Arranger Fees</u>.&nbsp; The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent and
the Arranger, for their respective accounts, the fees agreed to by the
Borrower, the Agent and the Arranger pursuant to that certain letter agreement
dated December 24, 2002, or as otherwise agreed from time to time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Delegation
to Affiliates</u>.&nbsp; The Borrower and the Lenders agree that the Agent
may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates.&nbsp;
Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents and
employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall
be entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles IX
and X.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Execution
of Documents on behalf of Lenders</u>.&nbsp; The Lenders hereby empower
and authorize the Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower on their
behalf all financing statements and any financing statements, agreements,
documents or instruments as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect
the purposes of securing the Collateral hereunder.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Collateral
Releases</u>.&nbsp; The Lenders hereby empower and authorize the Agent
to execute and deliver to the Borrower on their behalf any agreements,
documents or instruments as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect
any releases of Collateral which shall be permitted by the terms hereof
or of any other Loan Document or which shall otherwise have been approved
by the Required Lenders (or, if required by the terms of Section 8.2, all
of the Lenders) in writing.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Co-Agents,
Documentation Agent, Syndication Agent, etc</u>.&nbsp; Neither any of the
Lenders identified in this Agreement as a "co-agent" nor the Documentation
Agent or the Syndication Agent shall have any right, power, obligation,
liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those
applicable to all Lenders as such.&nbsp; Without limiting the foregoing,
none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship
with any Lender.&nbsp; Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments
with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the Agent in Section
10.11.

<br><b><u>SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS</u></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights
of the Lenders under applicable law and under Section 2.2 hereof, if any
Default occurs and is continuing and notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code (and subject to the Orders), without
any application, motion or notice to, or order from, the Bankruptcy Court,
any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional
or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness
at any time held or owing by any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender
to or for the credit or account of the Borrower or any Credit Party (except
with respect to amounts held in trust accounts, if any, and payroll accounts,
if any) may be offset, recouped and applied toward the payment of the Obligations
owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof,
shall then be due; provided that the Lenders shall provide notice to the
Borrower or such Credit Party following such setoff; provided further that
the failure to provide such notice shall not distinguish the Lenders' rights
under this Section 11.1(a).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations
is then due, whether pursuant to the occurrence of a Default or otherwise,
then each Guarantor authorizes the Agent and the Lenders to apply any sums
standing to the credit of such Guarantor with the Agent or any Lender or
any Lending Installation of the Agent or any Lender toward the payment
of the Guaranteed Obligations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Ratable
Payments</u>.
<br>If any Lender, whether by setoff, recoupment or otherwise, has payment
made to it upon its Loan (other than payments received pursuant to Section
3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any
other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion
of the Loan held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each
Lender will hold its ratable proportion of the Loan.&nbsp; If any Lender,
whether in connection with setoff, recoupment or amounts which might be
subject to setoff, recoupment or otherwise, receives collateral or other
protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to
setoff or recoupment, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take
such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such
collateral ratably in proportion to their Loan.&nbsp; In case any such
payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further
adjustments shall be made.

<br><b><u>BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS</u></b></center>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>12.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Successors
and Assigns</u>.&nbsp; The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the other Credit
Parties, Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors, assigns,
transferees and endorsees permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrower
and the other Credit Parties shall not have the right to assign their rights
or obligations under the Loan Documents without the prior written consent
of each Lender, (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3, and (iii) any transfer by Participation must be made
in compliance with Section 12.2.&nbsp; Any attempted assignment or transfer
by any party not made in compliance with this Section 12.1 shall be null
and void, unless such attempted assignment or transfer is treated as a
participation in accordance with Section 12.2.&nbsp; The parties to this
Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section 12.1 relates only
to absolute assignments and this Section 12.1 does not prohibit assignments
creating security interests, including, without limitation, (x) any pledge
or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of
a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion
of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support
of its obligations to its trustee; <i>provided</i>,<i> however</i>, that
no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release
the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the
parties thereto have complied with the provisions of Section 12.3.&nbsp;
The Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note
as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person
complies with Section 12.3;
<i>provided</i>,<i> however</i>, that the Agent
may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions
from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments
relating to such Loan or Note to another Person.&nbsp; Any assignee of
the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment
to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.&nbsp;
Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making
such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights
to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof),
shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of
the rights to such Loan.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Participations</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Permitted Participants; Effect</u>.&nbsp; Any
Lender may at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants")
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held
by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of
such Lender under the Loan Documents.&nbsp; In the event of any such sale
by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance
of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loan and
the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes
under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this
Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating
interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under the Loan Documents.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Voting Rights</u>.&nbsp; Each Lender shall
retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant,
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents
other than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan
or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require
consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 or of
any other Loan Document.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Benefit of Certain Provisions</u>.&nbsp; The
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right
of setoff and recoupment provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating
interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as
if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as
a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain
the right of setoff and recoupment provided in Section 11.1 with respect
to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant.&nbsp;
The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant,
by exercising the right of setoff and recoupment provided in Section 11.1,
agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise
of its right of setoff and recoupment, such amounts to be shared in accordance
with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.&nbsp; The Borrower
further agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.3, <i>provided
that</i> (i) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 than the Lender who sold the participating
interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest
for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant
is made with the prior written consent of the Borrower, and (ii) any Participant
not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or any
State thereof agrees to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5 to the
same extent as if it were a Lender.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Assignments</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Permitted Assignments</u>.&nbsp; Any Lender
may at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers")
all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.&nbsp;
Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A or in such
other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto.&nbsp; Each such
assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate
of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the
entire applicable Commitment and Loan of the assigning Lender or&nbsp;
(unless the Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less
than $5,000,000.&nbsp; The amount of the assignment shall be based on the
Commitment or outstanding Loan (if the Commitment has been terminated)
subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment
or as of the "Trade Date," if the "Trade Date" is specified in the assignment.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Consents</u>.&nbsp; The consent of the Borrower
shall not be required prior to an assignment becoming effective.&nbsp;
The written consent of the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment
becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a
Lender or an Approved Fund.&nbsp; Any consent required under this Section
12.3.2 shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Effect; Effective Date</u>.&nbsp; Upon (i)
delivery to the Agent of an assignment, together with any consents required
by Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2, and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee to the
Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived by the
Agent), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified
in such assignment.&nbsp; The assignment shall contain a representation
by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make
the purchase of the Commitment and Loan under the applicable assignment
agreement constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the
rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will
not be "plan assets" under ERISA.&nbsp; On and after the effective date
of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party
to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf
of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender
under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original
party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect
to the Commitment and Loan assigned to such Purchaser without any further
consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent.&nbsp; In the
case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender
hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject
to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which
survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the applicable agreement.&nbsp;
Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.3 shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation
in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.2.&nbsp; Upon
the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section
12.3.3 , the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall, if the
transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loan be evidenced by
Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that (a) new Notes or, as appropriate,
replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or,
as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each
case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted
pursuant to such assignment, and (b) thereafter, the old or replaced notes
shall be marked cancelled and returned to the Borrower.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Register</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower,
shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation
of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and
principal amounts of the Loan owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register").&nbsp; The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding

<br><b><u>GUARANTY</u></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Guaranty</u>.&nbsp;
Subject to Section 16.6, each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees, as primary obligor and not as surety, the full and punctual
payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or early termination
or otherwise, and at all times thereafter) and performance of the Obligations
(subject to the provisions of Section 16.6 hereof, being referred to collectively
as the "Guaranteed Obligations").&nbsp; Upon failure by the Borrower to
pay punctually any such amount, each Guarantor agrees that it shall forthwith
upon written demand pay to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and,
if applicable, their Affiliates, the amount not so paid.&nbsp; This is
a guaranty of payment and not of collection.&nbsp; Each Guarantor waives
any right to require the Lenders to sue the Borrower, any other guarantor,
or any other person obligated for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations,
or otherwise to enforce its payment against any collateral securing all
or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.&nbsp; The Agent is hereby authorized
to charge any account (except the Escrow Accounts, other trust accounts,
if any, and payroll accounts, if any) of the Guarantors maintained with
Bank One or any Affiliate of Bank One for each payment of principal, interest
and fees as it becomes due hereunder.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Guaranty
Unconditional</u>.&nbsp; Subject to Section 16.6, the obligations of each
Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise,
waiver or release in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation
of law or otherwise, or any obligation of any other guarantor of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or any default, failure or delay, willful or
otherwise, in the payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations;
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any modification or amendment of or supplement
to this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document;
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any release, nonperfection or invalidity of
any direct or indirect security for any obligation of the Borrower under
this Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document, or any obligations of
any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any action
or failure to act by the Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender
with respect to any Collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations;
<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except to the extent permitted under Section
6.23 hereof, any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership
of the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of
the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations;
<p>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the existence of any claim, setoff, recoupment
or other rights which any Guarantor may have at any time against the Borrower,
any Guarantor, any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
the Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith
or any unrelated transactions;
<p>(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any invalidity or unenforceability relating to
or against the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of
the Obligations, for any reason related to this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to
prohibit the payment by the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor
of the Guaranteed Obligations, of the principal of or interest on any Note
or any other amount payable by the Borrower under this Agreement, any Note
or any other Loan Document; or
<p>(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any other act or omission to act or delay of
any kind by the Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Obligations,
the Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever
which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal
or equitable discharge of any Guarantor's obligations hereunder other than
the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination
of all Commitments.
<br>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Discharge
Only Upon Payment In Full: Reinstatement In Certain Circumstances</u>.&nbsp;
Each Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect
until all Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full
and the Commitments shall have terminated or expired (other than contingent
indemnification obligations to the extent no claim thereto has been asserted).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Waivers</u>.&nbsp;
Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand,
protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided
for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken
by any Person against the Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other Person.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Subrogation</u>.&nbsp;
Each Guarantor hereby agrees not to assert any right, claim or cause of
action, including, without limitation, a claim for subrogation, reimbursement,
indemnification or otherwise, against the Borrower arising out of or by
reason of this Article XVI or the obligations hereunder, including, without
limitation, the payment or securing or purchasing of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations by any Guarantor unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations
are indefeasibly paid in full and any commitment to lend under this Agreement
and any other Loan Documents is terminated.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Application
of Payments</u>.&nbsp; All payments received by the Agent under this Article
XVI shall be applied by the Agent to payment of the Guaranteed Obligations
in the following order unless the Bankruptcy Court or other court of competent
jurisdiction shall otherwise direct:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FIRST, to payment of all reasonable costs and
expenses of the Agent incurred in connection with the collection and enforcement
of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any security interest granted to the
Agent in connection with any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECOND, to payment of that portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid interest and fees, pro rata
among the Lenders and their Affiliates in accordance with the amount of
such accrued and unpaid interest and fees owing to each of them;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THIRD, to payment of the principal of the Guaranteed
Obligations pro rata among the Lenders and their Affiliates in accordance
with the amount of such principal then due and unpaid owing to each of
them; and
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOURTH, to payment of any Guaranteed Obligations
(other than those listed above) pro rata among those parties to whom such
Guaranteed Obligations are due in accordance with the amounts owing to
each of them.
<br>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>No
Duty to Advise</u>. The Guarantors assume all responsibility for being
and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's financial condition and assets,
and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the
Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that
the Guarantors assume and incur under this Article XVI, and agree that
neither the Agent nor any Lender has any duty to advise the Guarantors
of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.</ol>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Tranche A Revolving Commitment</u>.&nbsp; Each
Tranche A Lender severally and not jointly with the other Tranche A Lenders
agrees, upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth,

to time during the period commencing on the date of satisfaction (or waiver)
of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 hereof and ending on the Termination
Date in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed, when added to such
Tranche A Lender's Tranche A Commitment Percentage of the then aggregate
Letter of Credit Outstandings, the Tranche A Commitment of such Lender,
which Tranche A Loans may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.&nbsp; Subject to the provisions of Section
2.01(c), at no time shall the sum of the then outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the Tranche A Loans <u>plus</u> the then aggregate Letter of
Credit Outstandings exceed the <u>lesser of</u> (i) an amount equal to
(A) the Total Tranche A Commitment of $800,000,000<b> </b>as the same may
be reduced from time to time pursuant to Section 2.10, Section 2.13 or
Section 2.14

be advanced only as set forth in Section 2.01(a)(2), and (ii) following
the execution and delivery of the Borrowing Base Amendment, the Borrowing

(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Tranche A Loan shall be made by the Tranche
A Lenders <u>pro rata
</u>in accordance with their respective Tranche A
Commitments; <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, that the failure of any Tranche
A Lender to make any Tranche A Loan shall not in itself relieve the other
Tranche A Lenders of their obligations to lend.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section

of Default, each of the Tranche A Lenders agrees, severally and not jointly,
in accordance with such Tranche A Lender's Tranche A Commitment Percentage,
to make the proceeds of Tranche A Loans available to the Collateral Agent
(notwithstanding the failure of the Borrower to satisfy the applicable
lending conditions thereto) in an aggregate amount not to exceed such Lender's
Tranche A Commitment Percentage of the Tranche A Reserve as follows: (i)
the proceeds of Tranche A Loans in an aggregate amount up to $20,000,000
shall be made available to the Collateral Agent in the sole discretion
of the Collateral Agent; and (ii) Tranche A Loans in excess of an aggregate
of $20,000,000 shall be made available to the Collateral Agent upon the
consent of the Required Lenders.&nbsp; Such proceeds shall be used by the
Collateral Agent for expenses incurred in the Collateral Agent's sole discretion
for maintenance of the Collateral and liquidation expenses.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Tranche B Term Loan Commitment</u>.&nbsp; Each
Tranche B Lender, severally and not jointly with the other Tranche B Lenders
agrees, upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth,
to make available to the Borrower a term loan in an aggregate principal
amount equal to such Tranche B Lender's Tranche B Commitment (collectively,
the "<u>Tranche B Loan</u>").&nbsp; Upon the satisfaction (or waiver) of
the conditions set forth in Section 4.01, each Tranche B Lender shall make
a Tranche B Loan to the Borrower in an amount equal to such Tranche B Lender's
Tranche B Commitment Percentage of $400,000,000.&nbsp; Once repaid, the
Tranche B Loan may not be reborrowed and the Total Tranche B Commitment
shall be automatically and permanently reduced by an amount equal to the
amount so repaid.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tranche B Loan shall be made by the Tranche B
Lenders <u>pro</u> <u>rata</u> in accordance with their respective Tranche
B Commitments; <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, that the failure of any
Tranche B Lender to make its Tranche B Loan shall not in itself relieve
the other Tranche B Lenders of their obligations to lend.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Availability</u>.&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, at no time shall Total Commitment

the date upon which the Borrowing Base Amendment shall have been executed
exceed the Borrowing Base, and no Loan shall be made or Letter of Credit
issued in violation of the foregoing.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 2.03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Letters of Credit</u></b>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein
set forth, the Borrower may request a Fronting Bank, at any time and from
time to time after the date of satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions
set forth in Section 4.01 and prior to the Termination Date, to issue,
and, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, such Fronting
Bank shall issue, for the account of the Borrower or a Guarantor one or
more Letters of Credit, <u>provided</u>, that no Letter of Credit shall
be issued if after giving effect to such issuance (i) the aggregate Letter
of Credit Outstandings shall exceed $100,000,000 or (ii) the aggregate
Letter of Credit Outstandings, when added to the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Tranche A Loans, would exceed the amounts permitted
to be outstanding pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and,
<u>provided, further</u>,
that no Letter of Credit shall be issued if the Fronting Bank shall have
received notice from either Agent (in consultation with the other Agent)
or the Required Lenders that the conditions to such issuance have not been
met.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Letter of Credit shall expire later than the Maturity
Date, <u>provided</u> that if any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding
on the Termination Date, the Borrower shall, at or prior to the Termination
Date, except as either Agent (in consultation with the other Agent) may
otherwise agree in writing, (i) cause all Letters of Credit which expire
after the Termination Date to be returned to the Fronting Bank undrawn
and marked "cancelled" or (ii) if the Borrower is unable to do so in whole
or in part, either (x) provide a "back-to-back" letter of credit to one
or more Fronting Banks in a form reasonably satisfactory to such Fronting
Bank and the Agents, issued by a bank reasonably satisfactory to such Fronting
Bank and the Agents, and in an amount equal to 105% of the then undrawn
stated amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such Fronting
Banks (less the amount, if any, then on deposit in the Letter of Credit
Account) and/or (y) deposit cash in the Letter of Credit Account in an
amount equal to 105% of the then undrawn stated amount of all Letter of
Credit Outstandings (<u>less</u> the amount of cash, if any, then on deposit
in the Letter of Credit Account) as collateral security for the Borrower's
reimbursement obligations in connection therewith, such cash to be remitted
to the Borrower upon the expiration, cancellation or other termination
or satisfaction of such reimbursement obligations and the other Obligations
(other than contingent indemnification obligations in respect of which
no claims giving rise thereto have been asserted) hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrower shall pay to each Fronting Bank, in
addition to such other fees and charges as are specifically provided for
in Section 2.21 hereof, such fees and charges in connection with the issuance
and processing of the Letters of Credit issued by such Fronting Bank as
are customarily imposed by such Fronting Bank from time to time in connection
with letter of credit transactions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drafts drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be
reimbursed by the Borrower in Dollars not later than the first Business
Day following the date of draw and shall bear interest from the date of
draw until the first Business Day following the date of draw at a rate
per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate <u>plus</u> 3.5% and thereafter
on the reimbursed portion until reimbursed in full at a rate per annum
equal to the Alternate Base Rate
<u>plus</u> 5.5% (computed on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days or when the
Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate, a year with 365 days or
366 days in a leap year).&nbsp; The Borrower shall effect such reimbursement
(x) if such draw occurs prior to the Termination Date, in cash or through
a Borrowing regardless of whether the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 4.02 are then met or (y) if such draw occurs on or after the Termination
Date, in cash.&nbsp; Each Tranche A Lender agrees to make the Tranche A
Loans described in clause (x) of the preceding sentence notwithstanding
a failure of the Borrower to satisfy the applicable lending conditions
thereto.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit
by any Fronting Bank, such Fronting Bank shall automatically be deemed
to have sold to each Tranche A Lender other than such Fronting Bank and
each such other Tranche A Lender shall be deemed unconditionally and irrevocably
to have purchased from such Fronting Bank, without recourse or warranty,
an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such Tranche
A Lender's Tranche A Commitment Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each
drawing thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors
under this Agreement with respect thereto.&nbsp; Upon any change in the
Tranche A Commitments pursuant to Section 10.03, it is hereby agreed that
with respect to all Letter of Credit Outstandings, there shall be an automatic
adjustment to the participations hereby created to reflect the new Tranche
A Commitment Percentages of the assigning and assignee Tranche A Lenders.&nbsp;
Any action taken or omitted by a Fronting Bank under or in connection with
a Letter of Credit shall not create for such Fronting Bank any resulting
liability to any other Lender except to the extent that the actions or
inactions of the Fronting Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit are
judicially determined to have constituted bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that a Fronting Bank makes any payment
under any Letter of Credit and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such
amount in full to such Fronting Bank pursuant to this Section, the Fronting
Bank shall promptly notify the Paying Agent, which shall promptly notify
each Tranche A Lender of such failure, and each Tranche A Lender shall
promptly and unconditionally pay to the Paying Agent (without defense,
set-off, counterclaim or other deduction) for the account of the Fronting
Bank the amount of such Tranche A Lender's Tranche A Commitment Percentage
of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in same day funds.&nbsp; If
the Fronting Bank so notifies the Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent so
notifies the Tranche A Lenders prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time)
on any Business Day, each Tranche A Lender shall make available to the
Fronting Bank such Tranche A Lender's Tranche A Commitment Percentage of
the amount of such payment on such Business Day in same day funds, and
if the Paying Agent so notifies the Tranche A Lenders after 11:00 a.m.
(New York City time), on the next Business Day.&nbsp; If and to the extent
such Tranche A Lender shall not have so made its Tranche A Commitment Percentage
of the amount of such payment available to the Fronting Bank, such Tranche
A Lender agrees to pay to such Fronting Bank, forthwith on demand such
amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until
the date such amount is paid to the Paying Agent for the account of such
Fronting Bank at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.&nbsp; The failure of
any Tranche A Lender to make available to the Fronting Bank its Tranche
A Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall
not relieve any other Tranche A Lender of its obligation hereunder to make
available to the Fronting Bank its Tranche A Commitment Percentage of any
payment under any Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above,
but no Tranche A Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Tranche A Lender to make available to such Fronting Bank such other Tranche
A Lender's Tranche A Commitment Percentage of any such payment.&nbsp; Whenever
a Fronting Bank receives a payment of a reimbursement obligation as to
which it has received any payments from the Tranche A Lenders pursuant
to this paragraph, such Fronting Bank shall pay to each Tranche A Lender
which has paid its Tranche A Commitment Percentage thereof, in Dollars
and in same day funds, an amount equal to such Tranche A Lender's Tranche
A Commitment Percentage thereof.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 2.04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Issuance</u></b>.&nbsp; Whenever the
Borrower desires a Fronting Bank to issue a Letter of Credit, it shall
give to such Fronting Bank and the Paying Agent prior written (including
telegraphic, telex, facsimile or cable communication) notice reasonably
in advance of the requested date of issuance specifying the date on which
the proposed Letter of Credit is to be issued (which shall be a Business
Day), the stated amount of the Letter of Credit so requested, the expiration
date of such Letter of Credit and the name and address of the beneficiary
thereof.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 2.05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Nature of Letter of Credit Obligations
Absolute</u></b>.&nbsp; The obligations of the Borrower to reimburse the
Tranche A Lenders for drawings made under any Letter of Credit shall be
unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without
limitation (it being understood that any such payment by the Borrower shall
be without prejudice to, and shall not constitute a waiver of, any rights
the Borrower might have or might acquire as a result of the payment by
the Fronting Bank of any draft or the reimbursement by the Borrower thereof):&nbsp;
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit; (ii)
the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which the Borrower
or any Guarantor may have at any time against a beneficiary of any Letter
of Credit or against any of the Lenders, whether in connection with this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction;
(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under
any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect; (iv) payment by a Fronting Bank of any Letter of Credit against
presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which
does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (v) any other
circumstance or happening whatsoever, which is similar to any of the foregoing;
or (vi) the fact that any Event of Default or event which upon notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 2.06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Making of Loans</u></b>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as contemplated by Section 2.11, Loans shall
be either ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request subject
to and in accordance with this Section, <u>provided</u>, that all Loans
made pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically
provided herein, be Loans of the same Type.&nbsp; Each Lender may fulfill
its Tranche A Commitment or Tranche B Commitment with respect to any Eurodollar
Loan or ABR Loan by causing any lending office of such Lender to make such
Loan; <u>provided</u>, that any such use of a lending office shall not
affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp; Each Lender shall, subject to its
overall policy considerations, use reasonable efforts (but shall not be
obligated) to select a lending office which will not result in the payment
of increased costs by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.15.&nbsp; Subject
to the other provisions of this Section and the provisions of Section 2.12,
Borrowings of Loans of more than one Type may be incurred at the same time,
provided that no more than ten (10) Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans may
be outstanding at any time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrower shall give the Paying Agent prior notice
of each Borrowing hereunder of at least three (3) Business Days for Eurodollar
Loans and one (1) Business Day for ABR Loans (subject, in the case of ABR
Loans, to the last sentence of this Section); such notice shall be irrevocable
and shall specify the amount of the proposed Borrowing (which shall not
be less than $5,000,000 (and integral multiples of $1,000,000) in the case
of Eurodollar Loans and $1,000,000 (and integral multiples of $100,000)
in the case of ABR Loans) and the date thereof (which shall be a Business
Day) and shall contain disbursement instructions.&nbsp; Such notice, to
be effective, must be received by the Paying Agent not later than 1:00
p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day in the case of Eurodollar
Loans and 12:00 noon, New York City time on the first Business Day in the
case of ABR Loans, preceding the date on which such Borrowing is to be
made except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 2.06(b).&nbsp;
Such notice shall specify whether the Borrowing then being requested is
to be a Borrowing of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans.&nbsp; If no election
is made as to the Type of Loan, such notice shall be deemed a request for
a Borrowing of ABR Loans.&nbsp; The Paying Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender of its proportionate share of such Borrowing, the date of such
Borrowing, the Type of Borrowing or Loans being requested and the Interest
Period or Interest Periods applicable thereto, as appropriate.&nbsp; On
the borrowing date specified in such notice, each Lender shall make its
share of the Borrowing available at the office of the Paying Agent at 270
Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, no later than 12:00 noon, New York
City time, in immediately available funds.&nbsp; Upon receipt of the funds
made available by the Lenders to fund any borrowing hereunder, the Paying
Agent shall disburse such funds in the manner specified in the notice of
borrowing delivered by the Borrower and shall use reasonable efforts to
make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower no
later than 2:00 p.m. New York City time (other than as provided in the
following sentence).&nbsp; With respect to ABR Loans in an aggregate amount
of $20,000,000 or less, the Lenders shall make such Borrowings available
to the Paying Agent and the Paying Agent shall disburse such Borrowings
in accordance with the Borrower's instructions consistent with this Agreement
by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the same Business Day that the Borrower
gives notice to the Paying Agent of such Borrowing by 10:00 a.m., New York
City time.

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Tranche A Loan or Tranche B
Loan, as the case may be, made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paying Agent shall maintain accounts in which
it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal
or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower
to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
Paying Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's
share thereof.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entries made in the accounts maintained
pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be <u>prima facie</u>
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
<u>provided</u>,
that the failure of any Lender or the Paying Agent to maintain such accounts
or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced
by a promissory note.&nbsp; In such event, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender
(or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns)
in a form furnished by the Paying Agent and reasonably acceptable to the
Borrower.&nbsp; Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note
and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant
to Section 10.03) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such
form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory
note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 2.08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Interest on Loans</u></b>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the provisions of Section 2.09, each ABR
Loan shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed over a year of 360 days or, when the Alternate Base Rate is
based on the Prime Rate, a year with 365 days or 366 days in a leap year)
at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate <u>plus</u> 3.5%.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the provisions of Section 2.09, each Eurodollar
Loan shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal, during

arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto, on the Termination
Date, after the Termination Date on demand and (with respect to Eurodollar
Loans) upon any repayment or prepayment thereof (on the amount so repaid

SECTION 2.09&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Default Interest</u></b>.&nbsp; In
the event that, and for so long as, any Event of Default shall have occurred

by law, on all Loans and overdue amounts (after as well as before judgment)
at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a year of 360 days or when the Alternate Base Rate is applicable
and is based on the Prime Rate, a year with 365 days or 366 days in a leap
year) equal to (x) in the case of Borrowings consisting of Eurodollar Loans,
the Adjusted LIBOR Rate in effect for such Borrowing <u>plus</u> 6.5% and

SECTION 2.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Optional Termination or Reduction
of Commitment</u></b>.&nbsp; Upon at least two (2) Business Days' prior
written notice to the Paying Agent, the Borrower may at any time in whole
permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce,
the Unused Total Tranche A Commitment.&nbsp; Each such reduction of the
Tranche A Commitment shall be in the principal amount of $5,000,000 or
any integral multiple thereof.&nbsp; Simultaneously with each termination
or reduction, the Borrower shall pay to the Paying Agent for the account
of each Tranche A Lender the Commitment Fee accrued and unpaid on the amount
of the Tranche A Commitment of such Tranche A Lender so terminated or reduced
through the date thereof.&nbsp; Any such termination or reduction shall
be applied to reduce the Tranche A Commitment of each Tranche A Lender,
the Tranche B Commitment of each Tranche B Lender and the outstanding loans
of the Bank One DIP Lenders under the Bank One DIP, in each case <u>prorata</u>
in accordance with the Combined DIP Commitment Percentage of each Tranche
A Lender, Tranche B Lender and Bank One DIP Lender, as applicable.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 2.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Alternate Rate of Interest</u></b>.&nbsp;
In the event, and on each occasion, that on the day two (2) Business Days
prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan,
the Paying Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive
and binding upon the Borrower absent manifest error) that reasonable means
do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted LIBOR Rate, the Paying
Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give written, facsimile
or telegraphic notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders,
and any request by the Borrower for a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans (including
pursuant to a refinancing with Eurodollar Loans) pursuant to Section 2.06
or 2.12 shall be deemed a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans.&nbsp; After
such notice shall have been given and until the circumstances giving rise
to such notice no longer exist, each request for a Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans shall be deemed to be a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 2.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Refinancing of Loans</u></b>.&nbsp;
The Borrower shall have the right, at any time, on three (3) Business Days'
prior irrevocable notice to the Paying Agent (which notice, to be effective,
must be received by the Paying Agent not later than 1:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the third Business Day preceding the date of any refinancing),
(x) to refinance (without the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Section 4 as a condition to such refinancing) any outstanding Borrowing
or Borrowings of Loans of one Type (or a portion thereof) with a Borrowing
of Loans of the other Type or (y) to continue an outstanding Borrowing
of Eurodollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, subject to the following:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a condition to the refinancing of ABR Loans with
Eurodollar Loans and to the continuation of Eurodollar Loans for an additional
Interest Period, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
at the time of such refinancing;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if less than a full Borrowing of Loans shall be refinanced,
such refinancing shall be made <u>pro rata </u>among the Lenders in accordance
with the respective principal amounts of the Loans comprising such Borrowing
held by the Lenders immediately prior to such refinancing;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the aggregate principal amount of Loans being refinanced
shall be at least $5,000,000, <u>provided</u>, that no partial refinancing
of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall result in the Eurodollar Loans
remaining outstanding pursuant to such Borrowing being less than $10,000,000
in aggregate principal amount;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each Lender shall effect each refinancing by applying
the proceeds of its new Eurodollar Loan or ABR Loan, as the case may be,
to its Loan being refinanced;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Interest Period with respect to a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans effected by a refinancing or in respect to the Borrowing
of Eurodollar Loans being continued as Eurodollar Loans shall commence
on the date of refinancing or the expiration of the current Interest Period
applicable to such continuing Borrowing, as the case may be;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans may be refinanced
only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto; and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each request for a refinancing with a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans which fails to state an applicable Interest Period shall
be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month.
<p>In the event that the Borrower shall not give notice to refinance any
Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, or to continue such Borrowing as Eurodollar
Loans, or shall not be entitled to refinance or continue such Borrowing
as Eurodollar Loans, in each case as provided above, such Borrowing shall
automatically be refinanced with a Borrowing of ABR Loans at the expiration
of the then-current Interest Period.&nbsp; The Paying Agent shall, after
it receives notice from the Borrower, promptly give each Lender notice
of any refinancing, in whole or part, of any Loan made by such Lender.

the Tranche B Loan in an amount necessary to cause the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Loans <u>plus</u> the aggregate Letter of Credit
Outstandings to be equal to or less than the Borrowing Base and (y) if,
after giving effect to the prepayment in full of the Loans, the undrawn
amount of outstanding Letter of Credit Outstandings in excess of the amount
of cash held in the Letter of Credit Account exceeds the lesser of the
Total Commitment and/or the Borrowing Base, as the case may be, deposit
into the Letter of Credit Account an amount equal to 105% of the amount
by which the aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings in excess of the amount
of cash held in the Letter of Credit Account so exceeds the Borrowing Base.

within the Borrowing Base) in an aggregate amount in excess of (1) $200,000,000
in respect of such sales or other dispositions made during the period from
the Closing Date through December 31, 2003 and (2) $300,000,000 in respect
of such sales or other dispositions made during the term of this Agreement,
to the prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.13(e).

which the Borrower may use to replace such Airframe in accordance with

an Event of Default, if such party has (x) within 30 days after the occurrence
of such Event of Loss, determined to apply such net cash proceeds to replace
such Engine, and (y) as soon as commercially reasonable and in any event
within 120 days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, has so applied
such net cash proceeds or has entered into a binding contractual arrangement

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrower shall have the right at any time and
from time to time to prepay any Loans, in whole or in part, (x) with respect
to Eurodollar Loans, upon at least (3) three Business Days' prior written
or facsimile notice to the Paying Agent and (y) with respect to ABR Loans
on the same Business Day if written or facsimile notice is received by
the Paying Agent prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, and thereafter
upon at least one (1) Business Day's prior written or facsimile notice
to the Paying Agent; <u>provided</u>, that (i) each such partial prepayment
shall be in integral multiples of $1,000,000, (ii) no prepayment of Eurodollar
Loans shall be permitted pursuant to this Section 2.14(a) other than on
the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto unless such prepayment
is accompanied by the payment of the amounts described in clause (i) of
the first sentence of Section 2.14(b), and (iii) no partial prepayment
of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall result in the aggregate principal
amount of the Eurodollar Loans remaining outstanding pursuant to such Borrowing
being less than $10,000,000;
<u>provided</u>, <u>further</u>, that any
optional prepayment of the Tranche B Loan shall be made on a basis that
is <u>pro</u> <u>rata</u> with, the Tranche A Loans (upon any such prepayment,
the Total Tranche A Commitments shall be automatically and permanently
reduced in an amount equal to such Tranche A Loan prepayment) and the loans
outstanding under the Bank One DIP (in accordance with the terms thereof),
<u>prorata</u>
in accordance with the Combined DIP Commitment Percentages of the Tranche
A Lenders, the Tranche B Lenders and the Bank One DIP Lenders, it being
understood that the Borrower may voluntarily prepay the Tranche A Loans
from time to time without permanently reducing the Tranche A Commitments
or prepaying the Tranche B Loan or the loans outstanding under the Bank
One DIP.&nbsp; Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date,
the principal amount of the Loans to be prepaid and in the case of Eurodollar
Loans, the Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which prepayment is to be
made, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such
Loan by the amount and on the date stated therein.&nbsp; The Paying Agent
shall, promptly after receiving notice from the Borrower hereunder, notify
each Lender of the principal amount of the Loans held by such Lender which
are to be prepaid, the prepayment date and the manner of application of
the prepayment.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrower shall reimburse each Lender, promptly
upon written demand therefor together with backup documentation reasonably
supporting such reimbursement request, for any loss incurred or to be incurred
by it in the reemployment of the funds released (i) resulting from any
prepayment (for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, by
acceleration, or by refinancing with ABR Loans) of any Eurodollar Loan
required or permitted under this Agreement, if such Loan is prepaid other
than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (including, without
limitation, any such prepayment in connection with the syndication of the
credit facility evidenced by this Agreement) or (ii) in the event that
after the Borrower delivers a notice of borrowing under Section 2.06 in
respect of Eurodollar Loans, such Loans are not made on the first day of
the Interest Period specified in such notice of borrowing for any reason
other than a breach by such Lender of its obligations hereunder.&nbsp;
Such loss shall be the amount as reasonably determined by such Lender as
the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of interest which would have accrued
to such Lender on the amount so paid or not borrowed at a rate of interest
equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Loan, for the period from the
date of such payment or failure to borrow to the last day (x) in the case
of a payment or refinancing with ABR Loans other than on the last day of
the Interest Period for such Loan, of the then current Interest Period
for such Loan, or (y) in the case of such failure to borrow, of the Interest
Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure
to borrow, over (B) the amount of interest which would have accrued to
such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable
period with leading banks in the London interbank market.&nbsp; Upon request,
each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower from time to time one or more
certificates setting forth the amount of such loss as determined by such
Lender, which certificate shall be conclusive as to the matters stated
therein.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event the Borrower fails to prepay any Loan
on the date specified in any prepayment notice delivered pursuant to Section
2.14(a), the Borrower promptly upon written demand by any Lender shall
pay to the Paying Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required
to compensate such Lender for any loss incurred by such Lender as a result
of such failure to prepay, including, without limitation, any loss, cost
or expenses incurred by reason of the acquisition of deposits or other
funds by such Lender to fulfill deposit obligations incurred in anticipation
of such prepayment, but without duplication of any amounts paid under Section
2.14(b).&nbsp; Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower from time to time
one or more certificates setting forth the amount of such loss as determined
by such Lender.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any partial prepayment of the Loans by the Borrower
pursuant to Sections 2.13 or 2.14 shall be applied as specified by the
Borrower or, in the absence of such specification, as provided for in Section
8.02(b), <u>provided</u>, that in the latter case no Eurodollar Loans shall
be prepaid pursuant to Section 2.13 to the extent that such Loan has an
Interest Period ending after the required date of prepayment unless and
until all outstanding ABR Loans and Eurodollar Loans with Interest Periods
ending on such date have been repaid in full.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the date of this Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not
having the force of law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments
to any Lender of the principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan made
by such Lender or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other than
changes in respect of Taxes, Other Taxes and taxes imposed on, or measured
by, the net income or overall gross receipts or franchise taxes of such
Lender by the national jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal
office or in which the applicable lending office for such Eurodollar Loan
is located or by any political subdivision or taxing authority therein,
or by any other jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing
authority therein other than a jurisdiction in which such Lender would
not be subject to tax but for the execution and performance of this Agreement),
or shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account
of or credit extended by such Lender (except any such reserve requirement
which is reflected in the Adjusted LIBOR Rate) or shall impose on such
Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
Agreement or the Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender, and the result of
any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making
or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received
or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest
or otherwise), in each case, by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material,
then the Borrower will pay to such Lender in accordance with paragraph
(c) below such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption
or effectiveness after the date hereof of any law, rule, regulation or
guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing
or in the interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender
(or any lending office of such Lender) or any Lender's holding company
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company,
if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Loans made by such Lender
pursuant hereto, such Lender's Tranche A Commitment or Tranche B Commitment
hereunder, as the case may be, or the issuance of, or participation in,
any Letter of Credit by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender
or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into account Lender's policies and the policies
of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), in
each case, by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material (except to
the extent that such amount is reflected in the Adjusted LIBOR Rate), then
from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding
company for any such reduction suffered.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A certificate of each Lender setting forth such amount
or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding
company as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be,
shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.&nbsp; The Borrower shall pay each Lender the amount shown as due
on any such certificate delivered to it within 10 days after its receipt
of the same.&nbsp; Any Lender receiving any such payment shall promptly
make a refund thereof to the Borrower if the law, regulation, guideline
or change in circumstances giving rise to such payment is subsequently
deemed or held to be invalid or inapplicable.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable
or reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand compensation with
respect to such period or any other period, <u>provided</u>, that the Borrower
shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for
any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to
the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the circumstance giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention
to claim compensation therefor. The protection of this Section shall be
available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity
or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change
or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed.

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
elsewhere in this Agreement, if (x) any change after the date of this Agreement
in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental
Authority charged with the administration thereof shall make it unlawful
for a Lender to make or maintain a Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to
its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to a Eurodollar Loan
or (y) at any time any Lender reasonably determines that the making or
continuance of any of its Eurodollar Loans has become impracticable as
a result of a contingency occurring after the date hereof which adversely
affects the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in such
market, then, by written notice to the Borrower, such Lender may (i) declare
that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder,
whereupon any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing shall,
as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan unless such
declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and (ii) require that all
outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be converted to ABR Loans, in which
event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR
Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph
(b) below.&nbsp; In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under
clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (a), all payments and prepayments
of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar
Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar
Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made
by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar
Loans.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For purposes of this Section 2.16, a notice to the
Borrower by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective,

be made <u>pro rata </u>among the Tranche A Lenders or Tranche B Lenders
(as applicable) in accordance with the then outstanding principal amount
of such Loans and/or participations in Letter of Credit Outstandings hereunder
and all payments of Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit Fees (other than
those payable to a Fronting Bank) shall be made <u>pro rata </u>among the
Tranche A Lenders in accordance with each Tranche A Lender's Tranche A
Commitment Percentage.&nbsp; All payments by the Borrower hereunder shall
be (i) net of any tax applicable to the Borrower or Guarantor and (ii)

SECTION 8.01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Administration by Agents</u></b>.&nbsp;
The general administration of the Loan Documents shall be by the Agents.&nbsp;
Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agents, at their discretion,
to take or refrain from taking such actions as agent on its behalf and
to exercise or refrain from exercising such powers under the Loan Documents
as are delegated by the terms hereof or thereof, as appropriate, together
with all powers reasonably incidental thereto (including the release of
Collateral in connection with any transaction that is expressly permitted
by the Loan Documents).&nbsp; The Agents and the Collateral Agent shall
have no duties or responsibilities except as set forth in this Agreement
and the remaining Loan Documents.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 8.02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Advances and Payments</u></b>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the date of each Loan to be made in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Paying Agent shall be authorized (but not obligated)
to advance, for the account of each of the Lenders, the amount of the Loan
to be made by it in accordance with its Tranche A Commitment or Tranche
B Commitment (as the case may be) hereunder.&nbsp; Should the Paying Agent
do so, each of the Lenders agrees forthwith to reimburse the Paying Agent
in immediately available funds for the amount so advanced on its behalf
by the Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Effective Rate
if not so reimbursed on the date due from and including such date but not
including the date of reimbursement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any amounts received by the Paying Agent in connection
with this Agreement (other than amounts to which the Paying Agent or the
Agents or the Collateral Agent are entitled pursuant to Sections 2.19,
8.06, 10.05 and 10.06), the application of which is not otherwise provided
for in this Agreement shall be applied, first, in accordance with each
Lender's Total Commitment Percentage to pay accrued but unpaid expenses,
Commitment Fees or Letter of Credit Fees, and second, in accordance with
each Lender's Total Commitment Percentage to pay accrued but unpaid interest
and the principal balance outstanding with respect to the Tranche A Loans
and the Tranche B Loans and all unreimbursed Letter of Credit drawings
and to cash collateralization of Letters of Credit.&nbsp; All amounts to
be paid to a Lender by the Paying Agent shall be credited to that Lender,
after collection by the Paying Agent, in immediately available funds either
by wire transfer or deposit in that Lender's correspondent account with
the Paying Agent, as such Lender and the Paying Agent shall from time to
time agree.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 8.03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Sharing of Setoffs</u></b>.&nbsp;
Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of
banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against the Borrower, or otherwise,
obtain payment in respect of its Loans as a result of which the unpaid
portion of its Loans is proportionately less than the unpaid portion of
the Loans of any other Lender (a) it shall promptly purchase at par (and
shall be deemed to have thereupon purchased) from such other Lender a participation
in the Loans of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of each Lender's Loans and its participation in Loans of the other
Lenders shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of all Loans then outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans
prior to the obtaining of such payment was to the principal amount of all
Loans outstanding prior to the obtaining of such payment and (b) such other
adjustments shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure
that the Lenders share such payment pro-rata, provided that if any such
non-pro-rata payment is thereafter recovered or otherwise set aside such
purchase of participations shall be rescinded (without interest).&nbsp;
The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees
that any Lender holding (or deemed to be holding) a participation in a
Loan may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff (in each
case, subject to the same notice requirements as pertain to clause (iv)
of the remedial provisions of Section 7.01) or counterclaim with respect
to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender as fully as
if such Lender were the original obligee thereon, in the amount of such
participation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 8.04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Agreement of Requisite Lenders</u></b>.&nbsp;

election or other action on the part of the applicable percentage of Lenders,
action shall be taken by (x) the Agents or, (y) in the case of certain
action in respect of enforcement of remedies against the Collateral by
the Collateral Agent, in either case for and on behalf or for the benefit

modification, consent, or waiver shall be effective except in accordance
with the provisions of Section 10.10.

employees and Affiliates shall in no event be liable to the Lenders or
to any of them for any action taken or omitted to be taken by them pursuant
to instructions received by them from the Required Lenders (or any other
applicable percentage of Lenders set forth in Section 10.10) or in reliance
upon the advice of counsel selected by it.&nbsp; Without limiting the foregoing,
none of the Agents, Collateral Agent and Paying Agent nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates shall be
responsible to any Lender for the due execution, validity, genuineness,
effectiveness, sufficiency, or enforceability of, or for any statement,

this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or in connection herewith or

SECTION 8.08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Independent Lenders</u></b>.&nbsp;

as agent, the provisions of this Section 8 shall inure to its benefit as
to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was agent under

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees the due and punctual payment by the Borrower of the Obligations.&nbsp;
Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the Obligations may be extended
or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from
it, and it will remain bound upon this guaranty notwithstanding any extension
or renewal of any of the&nbsp; Obligations.&nbsp; The Obligations of the
Guarantors shall be joint and several.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the Guarantors waives presentation to, demand
for payment from and protest to the Borrower or any other Guarantor, and
also waives notice of protest for nonpayment.&nbsp; The Obligations of
the Guarantors hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of the
Agent or a Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right
or remedy against the Borrower or any other Guarantor under the provisions
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any extension
or renewal of any provision hereof or thereof; (iii) any rescission, waiver,
compromise, acceleration, amendment or modification of any of the terms
or provisions of any of the Loan Documents; (iv) the release, exchange,
waiver or foreclosure of any security held by the Collateral Agent for
the Obligations or any of them; (v) the failure of the Collateral Agent
or a Lender to exercise any right or remedy against any other Guarantor;
or (vi) the release or substitution of any Guarantor or any other Guarantor.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the Guarantors further agrees that this guaranty
constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not just of collection,
and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Agents, the
Collateral Agent or a Lender to any security held for payment of the Obligations
or to any balance of any deposit, account or credit on the books of the
Agents, the Collateral Agent or a Lender in favor of the Borrower or any
other Guarantor, or to any other Person.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the Guarantors hereby waives any defense
that it might have based on a failure to remain informed of the financial
condition of the Borrower and of any other Guarantor and any circumstances
affecting the ability of the Borrower to perform under this Agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Guarantor's guaranty shall not be affected by
the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations
or any other instrument evidencing any Obligations, or by the existence,
validity, enforceability, perfection, or extent of any collateral therefor
or by any other circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise
constitute a defense to this Guaranty.&nbsp; None of the Agents, the Collateral
Agent, nor any of the Lenders makes any representation or warranty in respect
to any such circumstances or shall have any duty or responsibility whatsoever
to any Guarantor in respect of the management and maintenance of the Obligations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, upon the
Obligations becoming due and payable (by acceleration or otherwise), the
Lenders shall be entitled to immediate payment of such Obligations by the
Guarantors upon written demand by the Agents, without further application
to or order of the Bankruptcy Court.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 9.02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>No Impairment of Guaranty</u></b>.&nbsp;
The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any
reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including,
without limitation, any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration
or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability of the Obligations.&nbsp; Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not
be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Agents,
the Collateral Agent or a Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any remedy under this Agreement or any other agreement, by any waiver or
modification of any provision hereof or thereof, by any default, failure
or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations,
or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or
thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of
the Guarantors or would otherwise operate as a discharge of the Guarantors
as a matter of law, unless and until the Obligations are paid in full (other
than contingent indemnification obligations as to which no claim giving
rise thereto has been asserted).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 9.03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Subrogation</u></b>.&nbsp; Upon payment
by any Guarantor of any sums to the Agents, the Collateral Agent or a Lender
hereunder, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower&nbsp; arising
as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise, shall
in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior
final and indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations.&nbsp; If
any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor for the account of the Borrower,
such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Paying Agent
and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Paying Agent and the
Lenders to be credited and applied to the Obligations, whether matured
or unmatured.

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and their respective
successors and assigns.&nbsp; Neither the Borrower nor any of the Guarantors
may assign or transfer any of their rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of all of the Lenders.&nbsp; Each Lender may
sell participations to any Person in all or part of any Loan, or all or
part of its Tranche A Commitment or Tranche B Commitment (as the case may
be), in which event, without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of
Section 2.15 shall inure to the benefit of each purchaser of a participation
(provided that such participant shall look solely to the seller of such
participation for such benefits and the Borrower's and the Guarantors'
liability, if any, under Sections 2.15 and 2.18 shall not be increased
as a result of the sale of any such participation) and the pro rata treatment
of payments, as described in Section 2.17, shall be determined as if such
Lender had not sold such participation.&nbsp; In the event any Lender shall
sell any participation, such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility
to enforce the obligations of the Borrower and each of the Guarantors relating
to the Loans, including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (provided that
such Lender may grant its participant the right to consent to such Lender's
execution of amendments, modifications or waivers which (i) reduce any
Fees payable hereunder to the Lenders, (ii) reduce the amount of any scheduled
principal payment on any Loan or reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or the rate of interest payable hereunder or (iii) extend the maturity
of the Borrower's obligations hereunder).&nbsp; The sale of any such participation
shall not alter the rights and obligations of the Lender selling such participation
hereunder with respect to the Borrower.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Lender may assign to one or more Lenders or

the same portion of the related Loans at the time owing to it), <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>,
that (i) other than in the case of an assignment to a Person at least 50%
owned by the assignor Lender, or to a Lender Affiliate of such assignor
Lender, or by a common parent of both, or to another Lender, the Paying
Agent (with the consent of the Agents) and the Fronting Bank must give
their respective prior written consent to such assignment, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Tranche
A Commitment or Tranche B Commitment (as the case may be) and/or Loans
of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as
of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment
is delivered to the Paying Agent) shall, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by the Borrower and the Agents, in no event be less than $1,000,000
or the remaining portion of such Lender's Tranche A Commitment or Tranche
B Commitment (as the case may be) and/or Loans, if less&nbsp; and (iii)
the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Paying
Agent, for its acceptance (with the consent of the Agents) and recording
in the Register (as defined below), an Assignment and Acceptance with blanks
appropriately completed, together with a processing and recordation fee
of $3,500 (for which the Borrower shall have no liability).&nbsp; Upon
such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective
date shall be within ten (10) Business Days after the execution thereof
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Agent), (A) the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (B) the Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in
such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under
this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and
agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other
than the representation and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial
owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse
claim, such Lender assignor makes no representation or warranty and assumes
no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency
or value of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (ii) such
Lender assignor makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility
with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or any Guarantor
or the performance or observance by the Borrower or any Guarantor of any
of
its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, together with copies of the financial statements
referred to in Section 3.05 and such other documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision
to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agents, such Lender assignor
or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee
appoints and authorizes the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Paying
Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
under this Agreement as are delegated to such agents by the terms thereto,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental hereof; and (vi)
such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with its terms
all obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to be
performed by it as a Lender.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paying Agent shall maintain at its office a copy
of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Tranche A
Commitments or Tranche B Commitments (as the case may be) of, and principal
amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "<u>Register</u>").&nbsp;
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest
error, and the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Paying Agent and the Lenders
shall treat each Person the name of which is recorded in the Register as
a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.&nbsp; The Register
shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and the assignee thereunder together with
the fee payable in respect thereto, the Paying Agent shall, if such Assignment
and Acceptance has been completed with blanks appropriately filled and
consented to by the Agents and the Fronting Bank (to the extent such consent
is required hereunder), (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii)
record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give
prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower (together with a copy thereof).&nbsp;
No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment
or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
Section 10.03, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee
or participant, any information relating&nbsp; to the Borrower or any of
the Guarantors furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower
or any of the Guarantors; provided that prior to any such disclosure, each
such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall
agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of Section 10.04.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Base Certificate in accordance with Schedule I of the most recent Borrowing
Base Certificate;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an amount equal to the

5.03);
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an amount equal to the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The definitions
of the terms "Borrowing Base", "Borrowing Base Amendment" and "Borrowing
Base Certificate" set forth in Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement are
hereby amended in their entirety to read as follows:</dir>

<ol>
<ol>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<u>Borrowing Base</u>"
shall mean on any date the amount (calculated based on the most recent
Borrowing Base Certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) that is
equal to 55% of Eligible Borrowing Base Collateral Value <u>minus</u> (i)
the Carve-Out, (ii) a reserve satisfactory to the Agents (in consultation
with the Initial Lenders) on account of <u>pari</u> <u>passu</u> cash management
claims granted pursuant to Section 2.23(a) and permitted by Section 6.03(viii),
(iii) the Tranche A Reserve and (iv) other availability reserves established
by the Agents in their commercially reasonable discretion (it being understood
that the reserves referred to in clauses (ii) and (iv) of this sentence
shall not be applicable to extensions of credit in Stage I).&nbsp; Borrowing
Base standards (in respect of matters other than cash management claims)
may be established and revised from time to time by the Agents in their
sole commercially reasonable discretion (<u>provided</u>, that the Agents
may not revise Borrowing Base standards if the effect thereof would be
to increase the foregoing advance rate or the amount of the Borrowing Base
without the consent of the requisite Lenders as set forth in Section 10.10),with
any changes in such standards to become effective five (5) Business Days
after delivery of notice thereof to the Borrower.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<u>Borrowing Base Amendment</u>"
shall mean that certain First Amendment, dated as of February 10, 2003
to the Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Guaranty Agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<u>Borrowing Base Certificate</u>"
shall mean a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H together
with all supporting documentation required to be delivered as specified
in Schedule 1 to Exhibit H (with such changes therein from time to time
as may be required by the Collateral Agent to reflect the components of
and reserves against the Borrowing Base as provided for hereunder from
time to time), executed and certified by a Financial Officer of the Borrower,
which shall include appropriate exhibits, schedules and collateral reporting
requirements as referred to therein and as provided for in Section 5.07.
<br>&nbsp;</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section
5.07 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read
as follows:
<ol>&nbsp;
<br>SECTION 5.07&nbsp; <b><u>Borrowing Base Certificate</u></b>.&nbsp;
Following the execution and delivery of the Borrowing Base Amendment, furnish
to the Agents and the Collateral Agent as soon as available and in any
event (i) on or before the last Business Day of each month, a monthly Borrowing
Base Certificate as of the last day of the immediately preceding month
and (ii) if requested by either Agent (in consultation with the other Agent)
or Collateral Agent at any other time when either Agent (in consultation
with the other Agent) or Collateral Agent reasonably believes that the
then existing Borrowing Base Certificate is materially inaccurate, or at
any time following the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default,
as soon as reasonably available but in no event later than three (3) Business
Days after such request, a Borrowing Base Certificate showing the Borrowing
Base as of the date so requested, in each case with supporting documentation
and additional reports with respect to the Borrowing Base as either Agent
(in consultation with the other Agent) or Collateral Agent shall reasonably
request.</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 5.09
of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the number "30" appearing
therein and inserting in lieu thereof the number "45".
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Credit Agreement is hereby further amended by adding a new "Exhibit H"
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
Amendment shall not become effective until the date (the "<u>Effective
Date</u>") on which this Amendment shall have been executed by the Borrower,
the Guarantors and the Initial Lenders, and the Agents shall have received
evidence satisfactory to it of such execution.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except
to the extent hereby amended, the Credit Agreement and each of the Loan
Documents remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and affirmed.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Borrower agrees that its obligations set forth in Section 10.05 of the
Credit Agreement shall extend to the preparation, execution and delivery
of this Amendment, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of special
counsel to the Agents.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Amendment
shall be limited precisely as written and shall not be deemed (a) to be
a consent granted pursuant to, or a waiver or modification of, any other
term or condition of the Credit Agreement or any of the instruments or
agreements referred to therein or (b) to prejudice any right or rights
which the Agents or the Lenders may now have or have in the future under
or in connection with the Credit Agreement or any of the instruments or
agreements referred to therein.&nbsp; Whenever the Credit Agreement is
referred to in the Credit Agreement or any of the instruments, agreements
or other documents or papers executed or delivered in connection therewith,
such reference shall be deemed to mean the Credit Agreement as modified
by this Amendment.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Amendment
may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall
constitute but one and the same instrument.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
Amendment shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of New York.</ol>

<p><b>WHEREAS</b>, Section 10.03(b) of the Credit Agreement provides that
each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion
of its interests, rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Tranche A Commitment or Tranche
B Commitment and the same portion of the related Loans at the time owing
to it) by executing and delivering with such Eligible Assignee an Assignment
and Acceptance in substantially the form of Exhibit F to the Credit Agreement
(a copy of which is annexed hereto as Schedule I); and
<p><b>WHEREAS</b>, the Original Lenders wish to (i) assign to each of the
financial institutions (other than the Original Lenders) that is shown
on Annex A hereto as having a Tranche A Commitment (such financial institutions
other than the Original Lenders, collectively, the "<u>Tranche A New Lenders</u>"),
and each of the Tranche A New Lenders wishes to assume, a <u>pro</u> <u>rata</u>
portion of the Original Lenders' interests, rights and obligations under
the
Credit Agreement such that upon the Effective Date of this Amendment the
Original Lenders and the Tranche A New Lenders shall have the respective
Tranche A Commitments that are shown on Annex A hereto, and (ii) assign
to each of the financial institutions (other than the Original Lenders)
that is shown on Annex A hereto as having a Tranche B Commitment (such
financial institutions other than the Original Lenders, collectively, the
"<u>Tranche B New Lenders</u>"), and each of the Tranche B New Lenders
wishes to assume, a <u>pro</u> <u>rata</u> portion of the Original Lenders'
interests, rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement such that
upon the Effective Date of this Amendment the Original Lenders and the
Tranche B New Lenders shall have the respective Tranche B Commitments that
are shown on Annex A hereto; and
<p><b>WHEREAS</b>, the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Original Lenders,
the Tranche A New Lenders, the Tranche B New Lenders, the Agents and the
Paying Agent have determined that the execution and delivery of this Amendment
to effectuate a reallocation of the Total Commitment under the Credit Agreement
as in effect on the date hereof among the Original Lenders, the Tranche
A New Lenders and the Tranche B New Lenders will be more expeditious and
administratively efficient than the execution and delivery of a separate
Assignment and Acceptance between each of the Original Lenders and each
of the Tranche A New Lenders, and each of the Original Lenders and each
of the Tranche B New Lenders, respectively; and
<p><b>WHEREAS</b>, upon the occurrence of the Effective Date of this Amendment,
(i) each of the Tranche A New Lenders and Tranche B New Lenders shall become
a party to the Credit Agreement as a "Lender" and shall have the rights
and obligations of a Lender thereunder, (ii) the respective Tranche A Commitments
of each of the Original Lenders and Tranche A New Lenders under the Credit
Agreement shall be in the amount set forth opposite its name on Annex A
hereto under the heading "Tranche A Commitment", and (iii) the respective
Tranche B Commitment of each of the Original Lenders and the Tranche B
New Lenders under the Credit Agreement shall be in the amount set forth
opposite its name on Annex A hereto under the heading "Tranche B Commitment",
as each of the same may be reduced from time to time pursuant to Section
2.10 of the Credit Agreement;
<p><b>NOW, THEREFORE</b>, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
As used herein, all terms that are defined in the Credit Agreement (in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Date of this Amendment) shall
have the same meanings herein.</li>

<li>
Annex A to the Credit Agreement is hereby replaced in its entirety by Annex
A hereto.</li>

<li>
The signature pages of the Credit Agreement are hereby amended to conform
to the signature pages hereto.</li>

<li>
By its execution and delivery hereof, each of the Original Lenders shall
be deemed to have made each of the statements set forth in clauses (i)
and (ii) of paragraph 2 of the Assignment and Acceptance as if such statements
were fully set forth herein at length.</li>

<li>
By its execution and delivery hereof, each of the Tranche A New Lenders
and Tranche B New Lenders shall be deemed to have made each of the statements
set forth in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of paragraph 3 of the
Assignment and Acceptance as if such statements were fully set forth herein
at length.</li>

<li>
On the Effective Date, (i) each Tranche A New Lender will pay to the Paying
Agent (for the accounts of the Original Lenders) such amount as represents
such Tranche A New Lender's <u>pro</u> <u>rata</u> portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Tranche A Loans, if any, that are outstanding on
the Effective Date and such Tranche A New Lender's <u>pro</u> <u>rata</u>
portion of the aggregate amount of the then unreimbursed drafts, if any,
that were theretofore drawn under Letters of Credit, (ii) each Tranche
B New Lender will pay to the Paying Agent (for the accounts of the Original
Lenders) such amount as represents such Tranche B New Lender's <u>prorata</u>
portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B Loans and (iii)
the Paying Agent shall pay to each of the Tranche A New Lenders and Tranche
B New Lenders such fees as have been previously agreed to between the Agents
and such Tranche A New Lenders and the Agents and such Tranche B New Lenders,
respectively.&nbsp; Promptly following the occurrence of the Effective
Date, and in accordance with Section 10.03(e) of the Credit Agreement,
the Paying Agent shall record in the Register the names and addresses of
each Tranche A New Lender and Tranche B New Lender and the principal amount
equal to such Tranche A Lender's Tranche A Commitment, or such Tranche
B Lender's Tranche B Commitment, as the case may be, reflected on Annex
A hereto.</li>

<li>
By its execution and delivery hereof, each of the Tranche A New Lenders
and Tranche B New Lenders (i) agrees that any interest on the Loans, Commitment
Fees and Letter of Credit Fees (pursuant to Sections 2.08, 2.20 and 2.21
of the Credit Agreement) that accrued prior to the Effective Date shall
not be payable to such Tranche A New Lender or Tranche B New Lender and
authorizes and directs the Paying Agent to deduct such amounts from any
interest, Commitment Fees or Letter of Credit Fees paid after the date
hereof and to pay such amounts to the Original Lenders (it being understood
that interest on the Loans, Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit Fees respecting
the Total Tranche A Commitment of the Original Lenders, each Tranche A
New Lender and each Tranche B New Lender which accrue on or after the Effective
Date shall be payable to such Lender in accordance with its Total Commitment),
(ii) acknowledges that if such Tranche A New Lender or Tranche B New Lender
is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States,
such Tranche A New Lender or Tranche B New Lender has heretofore furnished
to the Paying Agent the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service
of the United States certifying as to such Tranche A New Lender's or Tranche
B New Lender's exemption from United States withholding taxes with respect
to any payments to be made to such Tranche A New Lender or Tranche B New
Lender under the Credit Agreement (or such other documents as are necessary
to indicate that all such payments are subject to such tax at a rate reduced
by an applicable tax treaty) and (iii) acknowledges that such Tranche A
New Lender or Tranche B New Lender has heretofore supplied to the Paying
Agent the information requested on the administrative questionnaire in
the form previously furnished by JPMorgan Chase.</li>

<li>
The Paying Agent shall promptly deliver to the Borrower the forms and other
documents furnished to it pursuant to paragraph 7(ii) hereof.</li>

<li>
This Amendment shall not become effective (the "<u>Effective Date</u>")
until (i) the date on which this Amendment shall have been executed by
the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Original Lenders, the Tranche A New Lenders,
the Tranche B New Lenders, the Agents and the Paying Agent, and the Paying
Agent shall have received evidence satisfactory to it of such execution
and (ii) the payments provided for in the first sentence of paragraph 6
hereof shall have been made.</li>

<li>
Except to the extent hereby amended, the Credit Agreement and each of the
Loan Documents remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified
and affirmed.</li>

<li>
The Borrower agrees that its obligations set forth in Section 10.05 of
the Credit Agreement shall extend to the preparation, execution and delivery
of this Amendment, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of special
counsel to the Agents.</li>

<li>
This Amendment shall be limited precisely as written and shall not be deemed
(a) to be a consent granted pursuant to, or a waiver or modification of,
any other term or condition of the Credit Agreement or any of the instruments
or agreements referred to therein or (b) to prejudice any right or rights
which the Agents or the Lenders may now have or have in the future under
or in connection with the Credit Agreement or any of the instruments or
agreements referred to therein.&nbsp; Whenever the Credit Agreement is
referred to in the Credit Agreement or any of the instruments, agreements
or other documents or papers executed or delivered in connection therewith,
such reference shall be deemed to mean the Credit Agreement as modified
by this Amendment.</li>

<li>
This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.</li>

<li>
This Amendment shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York.</li>

<p><b>FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT</b>
<br><b>UAL CORPORATION</b>
<br><b>EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN</b>
<br><b>(Effective as of July 12, 1994)</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By
virtue and in exercise of the amending power reserved to UAL Corporation
(the "Company") under Section 13.1(a) of the UAL Corporation Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (effective as of July 12, 1994) (the "Plan"), which amending
power thereunder is subject to the approval of the Air Line Pilots Association
International ("ALPA") and the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers (the "IAM"), the Company hereby amends the Plan to
reflect the changes in the law made by the passage of the Economic Growth
and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA") and adopts provisions
reflecting final regulations governing minimum required distributions,
subject to the approval of ALPA and the IAM, as follows.
<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following Appendix
B is hereby added to the plan:
<center>
<p><b>"<font face="">APPENDIX B</font></b><font face=""></font>
<p><b><font face="">PROVISIONS TO REFLECT CHANGES UNDER THE ECONOMIC GROWTH</font></b><b><font face=""></font></b>
<p><b><font face="">AND TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2001</font></b>
<p><b>PREAMBLE</b></center>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adoption and effective date of amendment.
This Appendix B to the Plan is adopted to reflect certain provisions of
EGTRRA and is intended as good faith compliance with the requirements of
EGTRRA and to be construed in accordance with EGTRRA and guidance issued
thereunder. Except as otherwise provided, this amendment shall be effective
as of the first day of the first Plan Year beginning after December 31,
2001.
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
B</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supersession of inconsistent provisions.
This amendment shall supersede the provisions of the Plan to the extent
those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment.
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Modification of Top-Heavy Rules.</u></b>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Effective Date.</u>&nbsp; This Section
shall apply for purposes of determining whether the Plan is a top-heavy
plan under Section 416(g) of the Code for Plan Years beginning after December
31, 2001, and whether the Plan satisfies the minimum benefits requirements
of Section 416(c) of the Code for such years. This Section 1 amends the
relevant provisions of Section 14 of the Plan.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Determination of Top-Heavy Status.</u><u></u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Key Employee.</u>&nbsp; Key Employee means any Employee or former Employee
(including any deceased Employee) who at any time during the Plan Year
that includes the Determination Date was an officer of the Employer having
annual compensation greater than $130,000 (as adjusted under Section 416(i)(1)
of the Code for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2002), a 5-percent
owner of the Employer, or a 1-percent owner of the Employer having annual
compensation of more than $150,000. For this purpose, annual compensation
means compensation within the meaning of Section 415(c)(3) of the Code.
The determination of who is a Key Employee will be made in accordance with
Section 416(i)(1) of the Code and the applicable regulations and other
guidance of general applicability issued thereunder.
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Determination of present values and amounts.</u>&nbsp; This Section
1(b)(ii) shall apply for purposes of determining the present values of
accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances of Employees as of
the Determination Date.
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Distributions during year ending on the Determination Date.</u>&nbsp;
The present values of accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances
of an Employee as of the Determination Date shall be increased by the distributions
made with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any plan aggregated
with the Plan under Section 416(g)(2) of the Code during the 1-year period
ending on the Determination Date. The preceding sentence shall also apply
to distributions under a terminated plan which, had it not been terminated,
would have been aggregated with the Plan under Section 416(g)(2)(A)(i)
of the Code. In the case of a distribution made for a reason other than
separation from service, death, or disability, this provision shall be
applied by substituting "5-year period" for "1-year period."
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Employees not performing services during year ending on the Determination
Date.</u> The accrued benefits and accounts of any individual who has not
performed services for the Employer during the 1-year period ending on
the Determination Date shall not be taken into account.
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
(c) <u>Minimum Benefits.</u><u></u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Matching contributions.</u> Employer matching contributions shall be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying the minimum contribution
requirements of Section 416(c)(2) of the Code and the Plan. The preceding
sentence shall apply with respect to matching contributions under the Plan
or, if the Plan provides that the minimum contribution requirement shall
be met in another plan, such other plan. Employer matching contributions
that are used to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements shall be
treated as matching contributions for purposes of the actual contribution
percentage test and other requirements of Section 401(m) of the Code.</dir>
</dir>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 <u>Direct Rollovers of
Plan Distributions</u></b>.
<dir>
<dir>(a) <u>Effective Date.</u>&nbsp; This Section 2 shall apply to distributions
made after December 31, 2001.
<p>(b) <u>Modification of Definition of Eligible Retirement Plan.</u> For
purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section 7.5 of the Plan,
an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described
in Section 403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b)
of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a
state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision
of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred
into such plan from this Plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan
shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or
to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Fourteenth Amendment to be executed
on December 19, 2002.

1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Purpose, History and Effective Date</u>.&nbsp;
UAL Corporation (the "Company") previously maintained the UAL Corporation
1992 Stock Plan for Outside Directors (the "Prior Plan") which provided
certain benefits to non-employee directors of the Company.&nbsp; In order
to (i) encourage stock ownership by directors to further align their interests
with those of the stockholders of the Company, while at the same time providing
flexibility for directors who, due to their individual circumstances, may
be unable to take stock in lieu of cash compensation, and (ii) add certain
deferral features for fees and stock awards and other items of cash compensation
as determined by the Board of Directors, the Company authorized a variety
of compensation alternatives, including those set forth in the Prior Plan,
that would be available to Outside Directors (as defined in subsection
1.2) and established the UAL Corporation 1995 Directors Plan (the "Plan").&nbsp;
The Plan and any and all amendments thereto were effective immediately
upon the respective approval thereof by the Board of Directors, except
that subsections 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 and all references
to Stock Awards, Stock Deferrals and the Company Stock Subaccount were
first effective on and the Prior Plan was terminated as of July 3, 1995
(the "Initial Effective Date").&nbsp; Stock deferrals made prior to the
Initial Effective Date under the Prior Plan were treated as deferrals under
subsection 4.2 of the Plan.&nbsp; The following provisions constitute an
amendment, restatement and continuation of the Plan as in effect immediately
prior to October 24, 2002.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Participation</u>.&nbsp; Only Outside Directors
shall be eligible to participate in the Plan.&nbsp; As of any applicable
date, an "Outside Director" is a person who is serving as a director of
the Company who is not an employee of the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company as of that date.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Administration</u>.&nbsp; The authority
to manage and control the operation and administration of the Plan shall
be vested in the Executive Committee of the Board (the "Committee").&nbsp;
Subject to the limitations of the Plan, the Committee shall have the sole
and complete authority to:</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interpret the Plan and to adopt, amend and
rescind administrative guidelines and other rules and regulations relating
to the Plan;</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correct any defect or omission and to reconcile
any inconsistency in the Plan or in any payment made hereunder; and</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to make all other determinations and to take
all other actions necessary or advisable for the implementation and administration
of the Plan.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The Committee's determinations on matters within its control
shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and all other persons.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member of the Committee shall act with
respect to the administration of the Plan except to the extent consistent
with the exempt status of the Plan under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Rule 16b-3").</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Shares Subject to the Plan</u>.&nbsp; Shares
of stock which may be distributed under the plan are shares of common stock
of the Company, par value $.01 per share ("Stock").&nbsp; The maximum number
of shares of Stock which shall be available for distribution or issuance
pursuant to the Plan shall be 400,000, all of which shall consist of treasury
shares of Stock (including, in the discretion of the Company, shares of
Stock purchased in the open market).&nbsp; The number of such shares of
Stock to be distributed pursuant to (i) Outside Directors' elections to
receive shares of Stock in lieu of Eligible Cash Fees (as described in
subsection 3.1) shall be determined in accordance with Section 3,&nbsp;
(ii) awards of Deferred Stock Units (as described in subsection 2.2) shall
be determined in accordance with subsection 2.2,&nbsp; (iii) Outside Directors'
Deferral Elections (as described in Section 4) shall be determined in accordance
with Section 4 and (iv) stock awards (as described in subsection 2.1) shall
be determined in accordance with subsection 2.1; provided, however, that:</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event of any merger, consolidation,
reorganization, recapitalization, spinoff, stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, rights offering, exchange or other change in the corporate
structure or capitalization of the Company affecting the Stock, the number
and kind of shares of Stock available for awards under Section 2 and the
annual awards of Stock and Deferred Stock Units provided thereunder shall
be equitably adjusted in such manner as the Committee shall determine in
its sole judgment;</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in determining what adjustment, if any, is
appropriate pursuant to paragraph (a), the Committee may rely on the advice
of such experts as they deem appropriate, including counsel, investment
bankers and the accountants of the Company; and</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no fractional shares shall be granted&nbsp;

1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Compliance with Applicable Laws</u>.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have
no obligation to deliver any shares of Stock under the Plan unless such
delivery would comply with all applicable laws and the applicable requirements
of any securities exchange or similar entity.&nbsp; Prior to the delivery
of any shares of Stock under the Plan, the Company may require a written
statement that the recipient is acquiring the shares for investment and
not for the purpose or with the intention of distributing the shares.&nbsp;

1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Director and Shareholder Status</u>.&nbsp;
The Plan will not give any person the right to continue as a director of
the Company, or any right or claim to any benefits under the Plan unless
such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Plan.&nbsp;
Participation in the Plan shall not create any rights in a director (or
any other person) as a shareholder of the Company until shares of Stock
are registered in the name of the director (or such other person).</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The "Fair Market Value" of a share of Stock on any date shall be equal
to the average of the high and low prices of a share of Stock reported
for New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions for the applicable date
or, if there are no such reported trades for such date, for the last previous
date for which trades were reported.</font>

1.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Nonassignment</u>.&nbsp; Neither a director's
nor any other person's rights to payments or awards under the Plan are
subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,
pledge, encumbrance, attachment or garnishment by creditors of the director.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

required to be filed with the Committee under the Plan will be properly
filed if delivered or mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid, or sent

to the terms and conditions of the Plan, including subsection 3.3, each
Outside Director may elect (but not retroactively) to forego receipt of
all or any portion of the Eligible Cash Fees (as defined below) payable

of equivalent value to the Eligible Cash Fees so foregone (determined in

For purposes of the Plan, the term "Eligible Cash Fees" means the retainer
fees, meeting fees, committee fees, committee chair fees, and any other
items of cash compensation as designated by the Board of Directors that
would otherwise be payable to the Outside Director by the Company in cash
as established, from time to time, by the Board or any committee thereof,

any portion of the Eligible Cash Fees otherwise payable to him or her for
any period (including any Eligible Cash Fees that he or she has elected
to receive in Stock pursuant to Section 3) until a future date (the "Distribution
Date") specified by the Outside Director in his or her Deferral Election
as of which payment of his or her Deferred Compensation Account attributable
to amounts deferred pursuant to his or her Deferral Election shall commence
in accordance with subsection 4.4; provided, however, that in no event

the Eligible Cash Fees credited to the Plan pursuant to (i) the Retirement
Plan Resolutions, the deferral of which is mandatory pursuant to the terms
of such resolutions, and (ii) subsection 2.2, the deferral of which is
mandatory.&nbsp; The Distribution Date for such deferrals shall not be

manner as the Distribution Date for Stock Awards as provided in this subsection
4.2; provided, however, that in no event shall the Distribution Date for
Deferred Stock Units be earlier than the first business day in January

Director pursuant to a Stock Deferral Election and any Deferred Stock Unit
(each, a "Stock Deferral"), shall be credited to a bookkeeping account
maintained by the Company in the name of the Outside Director (the "Deferred
Compensation Account"), which account shall consist of two subaccounts,
one known as the "Cash Subaccount" and the other as the "Company Stock

Outside Director has elected or is deemed to have elected to receive in
Stock pursuant to Section 3 and which he or she has also elected to defer
pursuant to subsection 4.1 or is required to defer pursuant to subsection
2.2 or the Retirement Plan Resolutions shall be credited to his or her

at the prime rate as reported by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> for the
current Accounting Date, or if such date is not a business day, for the
next preceding business day, except that, for the February 1, 1997 Accounting
Date, the portion of the Cash Subaccount representing amounts credited

which is attributable to Eligible Cash Fees payable prior to the Initial
Effective Date which the Outside Director has elected to receive in Stock
pursuant to Section 3 and which were credited to the Cash Subaccount pursuant
to the Outside Director's Deferral Election (as adjusted in accordance

(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finally, after adjustment in accordance with
the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), the Cash Subaccount shall
be credited with the portion of the Deferred Compensation or Supplemental
Benefit (as defined in the Retirement Plan Resolutions) otherwise payable
to the Outside Director since the last preceding Accounting Date or, in
the case of the Accounting Date occurring on February 1, 1995, subsequent
to January 1, 1995, which is to be credited to the Cash Subaccount, excluding
amounts previously credited pursuant to the following sentence.</font>

Director in Stock but for his or her Deferral Election, and as of December
31, 1996, in the case of the Eligible Cash Fees credited pursuant to the
Retirement Plan Resolutions which the Outside Director has elected to take
in Stock pursuant to Section 3, the Company Stock Subaccount shall be credited
with a number of Stock Units equal to the number of shares of Stock (including
any fractional shares) to which he or she would have been entitled pursuant
to Section 3;</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as of the date on which a Stock Award would
be made to the Outside Director pursuant to subsection 2.1 but for his
or her Stock Deferral Election, the Company Stock Subaccount shall be credited

(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as of December 31, 1997, and each December
31st thereafter, the Company Stock Subaccount shall be credited with a
number of Stock Units equal to the number of Deferred Stock Units awarded
pursuant to subsection 2.2;</font>

..&nbsp; Each such payment shall include a cash portion, if applicable,
and a Stock portion, if applicable, as follows:</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cash portion to be paid as of the Distribution
Date or any anniversary thereof and charged to the Cash Subaccount shall
be equal to the balance of the Cash Subaccount multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number
of remaining payments to be made, including such payment.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stock portion to be paid as of the Distribution
Date or any anniversary thereof and charged to the Company Stock Subaccount
shall be distributed in whole shares of Stock, the number of shares of
which shall be determined by rounding to the next lower integer the product
obtained by multiplying the number of Stock Units then credited to the
Outside Director's Company Stock Subaccount by a fraction, the numerator
of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of remaining
payments to be made, including such payment.&nbsp; The Fair Market Value
of any fractional share of Stock remaining after all Stock distributions
have been made to the Outside Director pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall
be paid to the Outside Director in cash.</font>
<br><font size=-1>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its
sole discretion, may distribute all balances in any Deferred Compensation
Account and/or all of the balance in any Company Stock Subaccount to the
Outside Director (or former Outside Director) in a lump sum as of any date.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Payments in the Event of Death</u>.&nbsp;
If an Outside Director dies before payment of his or her Deferred Compensation
Account commences, all amounts then credited to his or her Deferred Compensation
Account shall be distributed to his or her Beneficiary (as described below),
as soon as practicable after his or her death, in a lump sum.&nbsp; If
an Outside Director dies after payment of his or her Deferred Compensation
Account has commenced but before the entire balance of such account has
been distributed, the remaining balance thereof shall be distributed to
his or her Beneficiary, as soon as practicable after his or her death,
in a lump sum.&nbsp; Any amounts in the Cash Subaccount shall be distributed
in cash and any amounts in the Company Stock Subaccount shall be distributed
in whole shares of Stock determined in accordance with subsection 4.4(b),
and the Fair Market Value of any fractional share of Stock shall be distributed
in cash.&nbsp; For purposes of the Plan, the Outside Director's "Beneficiary"
is the person or persons the Outside Director designates, which designation
shall be in writing, signed by the Outside Director and filed with the
Committee prior to the Outside Director's death.&nbsp; A Beneficiary designation
shall be effective when filed with the Committee in accordance with the
preceding sentence.&nbsp; If more than one Beneficiary has been designated,
the balance in the Outside Director's Deferred Compensation Account shall
be distributed to each such Beneficiary per capita (with cash distributed
in lieu of any fractional share of Stock).&nbsp; In the absence of a Beneficiary
designation or if no Beneficiary survives the Outside Director, the Beneficiary
shall be the Outside Director's estate.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Multiple Distribution Dates</u>.&nbsp; If, as
a result of the applicable proviso to the last sentence of subsection 4.1(b)
or the penultimate sentence of 4.2 (the "Multiple Distribution Date Rules"),
there shall be more than one Distribution Date for an Outside Director's
Cash Subaccount or Company Stock Subaccount, then the Company shall take
all steps reasonably practicable to divide the respective subaccount into
two separate subaccounts, so that the credits, charges and payments related
to the different Distribution Dates are kept separate.&nbsp; In the event
an Outside Director has attempted to elect more than one Distribution Date
pursuant to the provisions of subsections 4.1 and 4.2 (other than under
the circumstances contemplated by the preceding sentence), the following
rules of construction shall apply:</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the most recent Distribution Date election
received by the Company in accordance with the Plan shall constitute a
revocation of all prior Distribution Date elections; and</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with respect to contemporaneous elections,
elections made pursuant to subsection 4.2 shall take precedence over elections
made pursuant to subsection 4.1, elections made pursuant to subsection
4.1(a) shall take precedence over elections made pursuant to subsection
4.1(b), and elections made with respect to Stock Awards shall take precedence
over elections made with respect to Deferred Stock Units.</font>

<p><u><font size=-1>SECTION 6</font></u>
<p><u><font size=-1>Summary of Amendments</font></u></center>

<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The shareholders approved a stock split in the form of a 300% stock dividend
on April 24, 1996.&nbsp; The authorized shares and the Stock Awards awarded
prior to the stock split have been adjusted to reflect the stock split
pursuant to resolutions approved by the Board on February 29, 1996.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Board of Directors amended the Plan pursuant to resolutions adopted
on September 26, 1996.&nbsp; The purpose of the amendment was to provide
for the grant of annual Deferred Stock Units under the Plan on December
31, 1996 and each December 31 thereafter as a replacement of the benefit
that was accruing to active Outside Directors under the Retirement Plan.&nbsp;
This annual deferred stock credit is calculated by dividing $8,500 by the
average market value of shares in December 1996.&nbsp; In addition, the
Board approved the one-time transfer of a lump sum amount equal to the
present value of the Outside Director's accrued benefit under the Retirement
Plan as of December 31, 1996.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Plan pursuant to resolutions
adopted on June 26, 1997.&nbsp; The purpose of the amendment was to provide
for an increase in the number of annual Deferred Stock Units to Outside
Directors to be implemented in two equal steps on December 31, 1997 and
December 31, 1998 as a restoration of the 10% reduction in meeting and
retainer fees taken in 1993 (and reaffirmed by the Board in 1994).&nbsp;
This increase in the deferred stock credit is calculated by taking the
average value of the 10% reduction ($4,400) using the average market value
of shares in December 1997.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatement of the Plan
pursuant to resolutions adopted on April 30, 2002.&nbsp; The purpose of
the amendment and restatement was to liberalize the stock and deferral
election procedures under the Plan.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatement of the Plan
pursuant to resolutions adopted on July 29,&nbsp; 2002.&nbsp; The purpose
of the amendment and restatement was to delete the limit on the&nbsp; number
of shares that are available for stock awards.</font>
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatementof the Plan
pursuant to resolutions adopted on October 24, 2002.&nbsp; The purpose
of the amendment and restatement was to specify the number of shares available
for issuance under the Plan.</font>

<br><b><font size=+0>Amendment No. 1</font></b></center>

<p><b><font size=+0>THIS AMENDMENT, </font></b>made as of the 8<sup>th</sup>
day of December, 2002, by and between UAL Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("UAL") and United Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("UA", UAL and
UA sometimes collectively referred to as "United") and Glenn F. Tilton

<center>
<p><b>WITNESSETH THAT:</b></center>
<b>WHEREAS,</b> the parties hereto have executed an employment agreement,
dated as of September 5, 2002 providing for the employment by United of
the Executive (the "Employment Agreement"); and
<p><b>WHEREAS,</b> the parties hereto hereby desire to amend the Employment
Agreement ("Amendment");
<p><b>NOW THEREFORE,</b> the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Section 3.b. shall be amended to read as follows:
<ol>
<ol><b><i>b. Base Salary</i>.</b>&nbsp; During the Employment Period, the
Company will pay the Executive a base salary (the "<u>Base Salary</u>")
at an initial rate of $950,000 per year in accordance with the Company's
standard payroll practices to be reduced<b> by 11% commencing with the
first pay period following the filing of a Chapter 11 petition with the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court / to $845,500 commencing on December 16, 2002. </b>The
Base Salary will be reviewed as part of the normal salary administration
program for the Company's senior executives by the Compensation Committee
of the Board (the "<u>Committee</u>"), for purposes of considering increases
in the Executive's Base Salary in light of the Committee's executive compensation
philosophy statement then in effect, the performance by the Executive of
his duties under this Agreement, and base salaries of chief executive officers
of companies in the peer group identified by the Committee in its executive
compensation policy.&nbsp; During the Employment Period the Committee will
review and consider further increases in the Base Salary, at times and
pursuant to the procedures used in connection with considering base salary
adjustments for United's other senior executives.&nbsp; Base Salary will
not thereafter during the term of this Agreement be decreased, unless such
reduction (i) is approved by the Board in accordance with the standards
set forth in the UAL Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and (ii) is
applied on a proportionally similar and no less favorable basis to Executive
than to substantially all other management employees of United.</ol>

<p><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Other Changes.&nbsp; In
all other respects, the provisions of the Employment Agreement shall remain
unchanged and in full force and effect.

with any payment or benefits received or to be received pursuant to the
terms of any other plan, arrangement or agreement with United, or any affiliate
thereof (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter called "Total
Payments") </font>would be subject (in whole or part), to any excise tax
(the "Excise Tax") imposed under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), then, the payments under Paragraph 3(A)
shall first be reduced and individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C) shall
thereafter be eliminated, to the extent necessary so that no portion of
the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax, but only if (A) the net
amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the
net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total
Payments) is greater than or equal to (B) the net amount of such Total
Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of
federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount
of Excise Tax to which Executive would be subject in respect of such unreduced
Total Payments); <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that Executive may elect

the Code shall be taken into account, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments
shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax
Counsel") reasonably acceptable to Executive and selected by the accounting
firm (the "Auditor") which was, immediately prior to the Effective Date,
United's independent auditor, does not constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason
of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax,
no portion of such Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in
the opinion of Tax Counsel, constitutes reasonable compensation for services
actually rendered, within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code,
in excess of the Base Amount (as defined in section 280G(b)(3) of the Code)
allocable to such reasonable compensation, and (iii) the value of any non-cash
benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments
shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F.&nbsp; <u>Air Transportation Safety and System

be received by the Executive hereunder, when taken together with any payment
or benefits received or to be received pursuant to the terms of any other
plan, arrangement, or agreement with United, or any affiliate thereof which
is, in the opinion of counsel selected by United ("Counsel"), included
in "Total Compensation" as defined by Section 104(b) of the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act (the "Act") would, in the opinion of
Counsel, exceed the limitation under Section 104(a) of the Act, then the
payments under Paragraph 3(A) included in Total Compensation shall first
be reduced and individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C) included in Total
Compensation shall thereafter be eliminated, <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>,
that Executive may elect to have individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C)
eliminated prior to any reduction of the cash payments under Paragraph
3(A).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Paragraph 3(F)(i) will not apply if (a)
United does not apply for Federal credit instrument under the Act by the
deadline stipulated in the Act or any amendment thereto or (b) if United
does apply for a Federal credit instrument under the Act by the deadline
but such Federal credit instrument is not actually issued to United for
any reason other than because the Executive's Total Compensation exceeds
the limitation under Section 104(a) of the Act.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

employment under this Agreement shall terminate and Executive will no longer
have the status of an active employee of United and will no longer be entitled
to any of the benefits of this Agreement (including the entitlement to
the payment and benefits described in Paragraph 3(C), other than those
required by law or otherwise vested), on the happening of the earliest
of the following events:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(i) Executive's death;
<p>(ii) Any material breach by Executive of Paragraph 6 or 9 hereof or
the failure by Executive to provide notice to United pursuant to Paragraph
4(B)(i) hereof;
<p>(iii) Executive's termination for Cause (as defined below).</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For purposes hereof, "Cause" shall mean (a) the willful and continued failure
by Executive to substantially perform Executive's duties with United (other
than any such failure resulting from Executive's incapacity due to physical
or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is
delivered to Executive by the Supervisor, which demand specifically identifies
the manner in which the Supervisor believes that Executive has not substantially
performed Executive's duties, and Executive shall not have substantially
performed within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, (b) the
willful engaging by Executive in conduct, including any conduct that is
a violation of Executive's duties set forth under Paragraph 7 or 8 hereof,
which is demonstrably and materially injurious to United or its subsidiaries,
monetarily or otherwise or (c) Executive's conviction for the commission
of a felony. For purposes of clauses (a) and (b) of this definition, no
act, or failure to act, on Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless
done, or omitted to be done, by Executive not in good faith and without
reasonable belief that Executive's act, or failure to act, was in the best
interest of United.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. <u>Election of Executive</u>. (i) During
the Term, if Executive elects to terminate his or her employment for any
reason, Executive will receive no further payments under Paragraphs 3(A)
above, and will no longer be entitled to any benefits under Paragraph 3(C)
(other than benefits required by law or otherwise vested). Before Executive's
election to terminate under this paragraph can become effective, Executive
must have provided United seven (7) days' written notice of his election
by registered mail addressed to the General Counsel of United at its principal
World Headquarters offices. Executive's termination of employment will
be as of the seventh (7th) day after receipt by United of such notice,
at which time he or she will no longer have the status of an active employee
of United (including the entitlement to benefits described in Paragraph
3(C), other than benefits required by law or otherwise vested).
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(ii) During the Term, if Executive takes a Competitive Position (as
defined below) with a Competitor (as defined below) upon agreeing to such
employment, he:
<p>(a) must immediately so notify United in writing by registered mail
addressed to the General Counsel of United at its principal World Headquarters
offices;
<p>(b) will be deemed to have elected to terminate his employment under
this Agreement (including the entitlement to benefits described in Paragraph
3(C)) effective as of the day Executive becomes employed by such Competitor;
and
<p>(c) will be entitled to no further compensation after such effective
date.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For purposes of this Agreement, (1) "Competitor" means any airline or air
carrier or any company affiliated, directly or indirectly, with another
airline or air carrier and (2) "Competitive Position" means becoming employed
by, a member of the board of directors of, a consultant to, or to otherwise
provide services of any nature to a Competitor directly or indirectly.
If during the Term, Executive desires to provide services whether as a
consultant, employee or otherwise to a Competitor and requests that United
consent to such provision of such services, United will reasonably consider
such request and will not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its
consent. In the event United consents to Executive's providing such services,
there will not be a termination of the Executive's employment under the
Agreement pursuant to this Paragraph 4(B)(ii).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. <u>Survival</u>. Notwithstanding any termination
of Executive's employment under this Agreement, Executive shall continue
to be bound by (1) the provisions of Paragraphs 6 through 16 hereof, and
(2) the provisions of Paragraph 4(B)(ii)(a) hereof.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5. <u>Regulations</u>. During his or her employment, Executive will be
governed by applicable United regulations, as in effect from time to time,
to the extent that such regulations are consistent with Executive's status
as an on-call employee.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6. <u>Confidentiality</u>.
<p>A. For purposes of this Agreement "Confidential Information" shall mean

are performed or offered to be performed, information concerning United's
fleet plan, cost structure, strategic plan, labor strategy, information
concerning the creation, acquisition or disposition of products and services,
personnel information, and other trade secrets and confidential or proprietary
information concerning United's business, but shall not include information
which (I) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by Executive, (II) was available to Executive
on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by UAL or UA, or (III)
becomes available to Executive on a non-confidential basis from a person
other than UAL, UA or their officers, directors, employees or agents who
is not otherwise bound by any confidentiality obligations with respect
to the information provided to Executive (the "Confidential Information").
<p>B. (i) Executive acknowledges that: (a) United's business is intensely
competitive and that Executive's employment by United has required and
during the Term may continue to require that Executive have access to and
knowledge of Confidential Information of United, (b) the direct or indirect
disclosure of any Confidential Information would place United at a disadvantage
and would do damage, monetary or otherwise, to United's business, and (c)
the engaging by Executive in any of the activities prohibited by this Paragraph
6 may constitute improper appropriation or use of such Confidential Information.
Executive expressly acknowledges the trade secret status of the Confidential
Information and that the Confidential Information constitutes a protectible
business interest of United.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Whether directly or indirectly, individually,
as a director, stockholder, owner, partner, employee, principal, or agent
of any business, or in any other capacity, during the Term of this Agreement

disclose, furnish, make available or utilize any of the Confidential Information,
other than in the proper performance of the duties contemplated under this
Agreement. Executive shall return any tangible Confidential Information,
including photocopies, extracts and summaries thereof, or any such information
stored electronically on tapes, computer disks, or in any other manner
that Executive has in his possession (a) on the Effective Date of this
Agreement, (b) at the end of the Term, and (c) at such time as United requests
Executive to do so.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Executive acknowledges and agrees that
due to the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information
he or she possesses, a breach or threatened breach by him or her of any
of the provisions contained in this Paragraph 6 will cause United irreparable
injury. Therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies, Executive
agrees that United shall be entitled to a temporary, preliminary, and permanent
injunction enjoining or restraining Executive from any such violation or
threatened violation, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
monetary damages or the posting of any bond or security. Executive consents
to jurisdiction for such enforcement in any state or federal court in the
State of Illinois.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) Executive further acknowledges and agrees
that due to the uniqueness of his services and confidential nature of the
Confidential Information he or she possesses, the covenants set forth herein
are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill
of United.
<br>Executive understands that it is United's intent to have this promise
of confidentiality enforced to its fullest extent. Accordingly, Executive
and United agree that, if any portion of this promise of confidentiality
is unenforceable, the court should still construe and enforce this promise
of confidentiality to the fullest extent permitted by law.
<p>C. Executive agrees to keep the terms of and circumstances surrounding
this Agreement and of his or her working arrangement, as defined herein,
confidential except that the source and amount of his or her income may
be revealed as necessary for tax, loan purposes and the like.

respective present or former officers, directors, partners, shareholders,

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement")
is made and entered into as of February 16, 2003 (the "Effective Date")

an employee of UA (such position is hereinafter referred to as the "Executive
Position");

desire to fully settle and resolve any and all issues arising out of Executive's
employment with United and the termination of his or her full time employment
as an executive officer by United;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, United wishes to
retain certain limited services of Executive, and Executive wishes to provide
said services to United, in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth herein; and

by and between United and Executive as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Continued Employment</u>.&nbsp;
Effective as of the Effective Date, Executive will continue to be actively
employed by United, and Executive will perform services for United by being
"on call", including testifying on behalf of United, and subject to such
other assignments consistent with Executive's experience and reasonably
acceptable to Executive as may be reasonably requested by either the person
who is Executive's supervisor immediately prior to the Effective Date (the
"Supervisor") or the Supervisor's successor; provided that such requests
shall not unreasonably interfere with any employment or business pursuits,
including consulting, that Executive may be engaged in from time to time.

Employment</u>
<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United agrees to employ Executive and

</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the benefits
enumerated in Paragraph 3(C) is subject to the practices, rules, and regulations
of United, as in effect from time to time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that any payment or
benefit received or to be received by Executive hereunder, when taken together
with any payment or benefits received or to be received pursuant to the
terms of any other plan, arrangement or agreement with United, or any affiliate
thereof (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter called "Total
Payments") would be subject (in whole or part), to any excise tax (the
"Excise Tax") imposed under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), then, the payments under Paragraph 3(A)
shall first be reduced and individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C) shall
thereafter be eliminated, to the extent necessary so that no portion of
the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax, but only if (A) the net
amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the
net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total
Payments) is greater than or equal to (B) the net amount of such Total
Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of
federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount
of Excise Tax to which Executive would be subject in respect of such unreduced
Total Payments); <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that Executive may elect
to have individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C) eliminated prior to any
reduction of the cash payments under Paragraphs 3(A).
<dir>&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; For purposes of determining whether and the
extent to which the Total Payments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments
the receipt or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enjoyment of which
Executive shall have waived at such time and in such manner as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
not to constitute a "payment" within the meaning of section 280G(b) of
the Code&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be taken into
account, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
account which, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably
acceptable to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive and selected
by the accounting firm (the "Auditor") which was,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
immediately prior to the Effective Date, United's independent auditor,
does not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Code (including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in
calculating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Excise Tax, no portion
of such Total Payments shall be taken into account which,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the opinion of Tax Counsel, constitutes reasonable compensation for
services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually rendered, within
the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the Base Amount (as defined in section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable
to such&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable compensation, and (iii)
the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by
the Auditor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in accordance with the principles
of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization
Act</u>.
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
in the event that any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; payment
or benefit received or to be received by the Executive hereunder, when
taken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together with any payment
or benefits received or to be received pursuant to the terms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of any other plan, arrangement, or agreement with United, or any affiliate
thereof&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which is, in the opinion
of counsel selected by United ("Counsel"), included in "Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Compensation" as defined by Section 104(b) of the Air Transportation Safety
and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System Stabilization Act (the "Act")
would, in the opinion of Counsel, exceed the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
limitation under Section 104(a) of the Act, then the payments under Paragraph
3(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; included in Total Compensation
shall first be reduced and individual benefits under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paragraph 3(C) included in Total Compensation shall thereafter be eliminated,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that Executive may elect to have individual
benefits under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph 3(C) eliminated
prior to any reduction of the cash payments under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paragraph 3(A).
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph 3(F)(i) will
not apply if (a) United does not apply for Federal credit instrument under
the Act by the deadline stipulated in the Act or any amendment thereto
or (b) if United does apply for a Federal credit instrument under the Act
by the deadline but such Federal credit instrument is not actually issued
to United for any reason other than because the Executive's Total Compensation
exceeds the limitation under Section 104(a) of the Act.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Termination
of Employment Under Agreement</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Non-Election
of Executive</u>.&nbsp; Executive's employment under this Agreement shall
terminate and Executive will no longer have the status of an active employee
of United and will no longer be entitled to any of the benefits of this
Agreement (including the entitlement to the payment and benefits described
in Paragraph 3(C), other than those required by law or otherwise vested),
on the happening of the earliest of the following events:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Executive's death;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any material breach by Executive of Paragraph 6 or 9 hereof or the failure
by Executive to provide notice to United
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pursuant&nbsp; to Paragraph 4(B)(i) hereof;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Executive's termination for Cause (as defined below).</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For purposes hereof, "Cause" shall mean (a) the willful and continued failure
by Executive to substantially perform Executive's duties with United (other
than any such failure resulting from Executive's incapacity due to physical
or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is
delivered to Executive by the Supervisor, which demand specifically identifies
the manner in which the Supervisor believes that Executive has not substantially
performed Executive's duties, and Executive shall not have substantially
performed within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice,&nbsp;
(b) the willful engaging by Executive in conduct, including any conduct
that is a violation of Executive's duties set forth under Paragraph 7 or
8 hereof, which is demonstrably and materially injurious to United or its
subsidiaries, monetarily or otherwise or (c) Executive's conviction for
the commission of a felony.&nbsp; For purposes of clauses (a) and (b) of
this definition, no act, or failure to act, on Executive's part shall be
deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by Executive not in
good faith and without reasonable belief that Executive's act, or failure
to act, was in the best interest of United.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Election
of Executive</u>.&nbsp; (i) During the Term, if Executive elects to terminate
his or her employment for any reason, Executive will receive no further
payments under Paragraphs 3(A) above, and will no longer be entitled to
any benefits under Paragraph 3(C) (other than benefits required by law
or otherwise vested). Before Executive's election to terminate under this
paragraph can become effective, Executive must have provided United seven
(7) days' written notice of his election by registered mail addressed to
the General Counsel of United at its principal World Headquarters offices.&nbsp;
Executive's termination of employment will be as of the seventh (7th) day
after receipt by United of such notice, at which time he or she will no
longer have the status of an active employee of United (including the entitlement
to benefits described in Paragraph 3(C), other than benefits required by
law or otherwise vested).
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Term, if Executive
takes a Competitive Position (as defined below) with a Competitor (as defined
below) upon agreeing to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such employment,
he:
<dir>&nbsp;
<br>(a) must immediately so notify United in writing by registered mail
addressed to the General Counsel of United at its principal World Headquarters
offices;
<p>(b) will be deemed to have elected to terminate his employment under
this Agreement (including the entitlement to benefits described in Paragraph
3(C)) effective as of the day Executive becomes employed by such Competitor;
and
<p>(c) will be entitled to no further compensation after such effective
date.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For purposes of this Agreement, (1) "Competitor" means any airline or air
carrier or any company affiliated, directly or indirectly, with another
airline or air carrier and (2) "Competitive Position" means becoming employed
by, a member of the board of directors of, a consultant to, or to otherwise
provide services of any nature to a Competitor directly or indirectly.&nbsp;
If during the Term, Executive desires to provide services whether as a
consultant, employee or otherwise to a Competitor and requests that United
consent to such provision of such services, United will reasonably consider
such request and will not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its
consent.&nbsp; In the event United consents to Executive's providing such
services, there will not be a termination of the Executive's employment
under the Agreement pursuant to this Paragraph 4(B)(ii).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Survival</u>.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding any termination of Executive's employment under this Agreement,
Executive shall continue to be bound by (1) the provisions of Paragraphs
6 through 16 hereof, and (2) the provisions of Paragraph 4(B)(ii)(a) hereof.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Regulations</u>.&nbsp;
During his or her employment, Executive will be governed by applicable
United regulations, as in effect from time to time, to the extent that
such regulations are consistent with Executive's status as an on-call employee.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Confidentiality</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For purposes of this Agreement "Confidential Information" shall mean and
include, but not be limited to, the kinds of services provided or proposed
to be provided by United to customers, the manner in which such services
are performed or offered to be performed, information concerning United's
fleet plan, cost structure, strategic plan, labor strategy, information
concerning the creation, acquisition or disposition of products and services,
personnel information, and other trade secrets and confidential or proprietary
information concerning United's business, but shall not include information
which (I) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by Executive, (II) was available to Executive
on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by UAL or UA, or (III)
becomes available to Executive on a non-confidential basis from a person
other than UAL, UA or their officers, directors, employees or agents who
is not otherwise bound by any confidentiality obligations with respect
to the information provided to Executive (the "Confidential Information").
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp; Executive acknowledges that: (a) United's business is intensely
competitive and that Executive's employment by United has required and
during the Term may continue to require that Executive have access to and
knowledge of Confidential Information of United, (b) the direct or indirect
disclosure of any Confidential Information would place United at a disadvantage
and would do damage, monetary or otherwise, to United's business, and (c)
the engaging by Executive in any of the activities prohibited by this Paragraph
6 may constitute improper appropriation or use of such Confidential Information.&nbsp;
Executive expressly acknowledges the trade secret status of the Confidential
Information and that the Confidential Information constitutes a protectible
business interest of United.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp; Whether directly or indirectly, individually, as a director,
stockholder, owner, partner, employee, principal, or agent of any business,
or in any other capacity, during the Term of this Agreement and for the
two (2) year period thereafter, Executive shall not make known, disclose,
furnish, make available or utilize any of the Confidential Information,
other than in the proper performance of the duties contemplated under this
Agreement.&nbsp; Executive shall return any tangible Confidential Information,
including photocopies, extracts and summaries thereof, or any such information
stored electronically on tapes, computer disks, or in any other manner
that Executive has in his possession (a) on the Effective Date of this
Agreement, (b) at the end of the Term, and (c) at such time as United requests
Executive to do so.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii) Executive acknowledges and agrees that due to the confidential and
proprietary nature of the Confidential Information he or she possesses,
a breach or threatened breach by him or her of any of the provisions contained
in this Paragraph 6 will cause United irreparable injury.&nbsp; Therefore,
in addition to any other rights or remedies, Executive agrees that United
shall be entitled to a temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunction
enjoining or restraining Executive from any such violation or threatened
violation, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary
damages or the posting of any bond or security.&nbsp; Executive consents
to jurisdiction for such enforcement in any state or federal court in the
State of Illinois.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv) Executive further acknowledges and agrees that due to the uniqueness
of his services and confidential nature of the Confidential Information
he or she possesses, the covenants set forth herein are reasonable and
necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of United.&nbsp;
Executive understands that it is United's intent to have this promise of
confidentiality enforced to its fullest extent.&nbsp; Accordingly, Executive
and United agree that, if any portion of this promise of confidentiality
is unenforceable, the court should still construe and enforce this promise
of confidentiality to the fullest extent permitted by law.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Executive agrees to keep the terms of and circumstances surrounding this
Agreement and of his or her working arrangement, as defined herein, confidential
except that the source and amount of his or her income may be revealed
as necessary for tax, loan purposes and the like.
<ol START=7>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Non-Disparagement</u>.</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Executive agrees not to make, or cause to be made, any statement, observation
or opinion, or communicate any information (whether oral or written, directly
or indirectly) that (a) accuses or implies that United and/or any of its
parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, together with their respective present
or former officers, directors, partners, shareholders, employees and agents,
and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns, engaged in any
wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct, whether relating to Executive's
employment (or the termination thereof), the business or operations of
United, or otherwise; or (b) disparages, impugns or in any way reflects
adversely upon the business or reputation of United and/or any of its parents,
subsidiaries and affiliates, together with their respective present or
former officers, directors, partners, shareholders, employees and agents,
and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
United agrees not to willfully authorize any statement, observation or
opinion (whether oral or written, direct or indirect) that is materially
injurious to Executive and that (a) accuses or implies that Executive engaged
in any wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct relating to Executive's employment
with United or (b) disparages, impugns or in any way reflects adversely
upon the reputation of Executive.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude Executive or United from providing
truthful testimony or information pursuant to subpoena, court order or
similar legal process.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Non-Solicitation
of Employees</u>:&nbsp; Executive agrees that Executive will not, during
the Term, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of any Competitor (as
defined in Paragraph 4(B) hereof) of United, solicit the employment or
services of, hire, or assist in the hiring of any person eligible for the
Performance Incentive Plan or any successor Plan.
<blockquote>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Assent and Release</u>.</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
consideration for the payments and benefits provided in this Agreement,
Executive hereby voluntarily, knowingly, willingly, irrevocably, and unconditionally
releases UA and UAL together with their respective parents, subsidiaries
and affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives, attorneys and agents, and each of their respective predecessors,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Releasees") from any and all
charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements,
causes of action, rights, costs, losses, debts, and expenses of any nature
whatsoever, known or unknown, which against them Executive or his or her
successors or assigns ever had, now have or hereafter can, shall or may
have (either directly, indirectly, derivatively or in any other representative
capacity) by reason of any matter, fact or cause whatsoever arising from
the beginning of time to the date of this Agreement, including without
limitation all claims arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1991, the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ("ADEA"),
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Equal

hereafter recognized, including but not limited to the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act, the Colorado anti-discrimination laws, the
Illinois Human Rights Act, the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination and
the New York City and State Human Rights Law, each as amended.&nbsp; This
release by Executive of the Releasees also includes, without limitation,
all claims arising under each employee pension, employee welfare, and executive
compensation plan of United now in effect or hereafter adopted, except
for any benefits to be provided to Executive under this Agreement or in
the normal course of Executive's employment through the Effective Date.&nbsp;
It is agreed that this paragraph shall survive termination of the Agreement.&nbsp;
Nothing in this Paragraph 9 shall affect or impair any right that Executive
has to either (1) indemnification pursuant to United's bylaws or applicable
law or (2) any vested benefit under United's employee benefit plans.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Executive expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by entering into this
Agreement, Executive is waiving any and all rights or claims that he may
have arising under the ADEA, as amended, which have arisen on or before
the date of execution of this Agreement.&nbsp; Executive further expressly
acknowledges and agrees that:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In return for this Agreement,
Executive will receive compensation beyond that which he was already entitled
to receive before
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
entering into this Agreement;
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive has been advised
by United to consult with an attorney before signing this Agreement;
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive was given a copy
of this Agreement on or before February 20, 2003.&nbsp; Executive has been
informed that Executive
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
has not less than twenty-one (21) days from February 20, 2003 within which
to consider the Agreement and, if Executive
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
considers this Agreement for fewer than 21 days, then Executive agrees
that he has had a reasonable period of time to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
consider the Agreement; and
<p>&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive was informed that Executive
had seven (7) days following the date of execution of the Agreement in
which to revoke
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Agreement.&nbsp;
After seven (7) days this Agreement will become effective, enforceable
and irrevocable unless written
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
revocation is received by the undersigned from Executive on or before the
close of business on the seventh (7th) day after
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive
executed this Agreement.&nbsp; If Executive revokes this Agreement it shall
not be effective or enforceable and Executive will
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not receive
the compensation or benefits described in this Agreement.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Waiver
of Unknown Claims</u>:&nbsp; It is the intention of Executive and United
in executing this Agreement that the same shall be effective as a bar to
each and every claim, demand and cause of action hereinabove specified.&nbsp;
In furtherance of this intention, Executive hereby expressly waives any
and all rights and benefits conferred upon Executive by the provisions
of SECTION 1542 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE, to the extent applicable
to Executive, and expressly consents that this Agreement shall be given
full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and
provisions, including as well those related to unknown and unsuspected
claims, demands and causes of action, if any, as well as those relating
to any other claims, demands and causes of action hereinabove specified.&nbsp;
SECTION 1542 provides:
<dir>
<dir>"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES
NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT
WITH THE DEBTOR."</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive and UA acknowledge that
Executive and UA may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to
or different from those which Executive and UA now knows or believes to
exist with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and which, if
known or suspected at the time of executing this Agreement, may have materially
affected this settlement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
UA and UAL together with their respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliates,
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives,
attorneys and agents, and each of their respective predecessors, successors
and assigns hereby expressly release Executive from any an all charges,
complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, causes
of action, rights, costs, losses, debts, and expenses of any nature whatsoever,
known or unknown, which UA or UAL ever had, now has or hereafter can, shall
or may have (either directly, indirectly, derivatively or in any other
representative capacity) by reason of any matter, fact or cause whatsoever
arising from the beginning of time to the date of execution of this Agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Non-Assignability;
Assignment in the Event of Acquisition or Merger</u>.&nbsp; This Agreement
and the benefits hereunder are not assignable or transferable by Executive;
the rights and obligations of United under this Agreement will automatically
be deemed to be assigned by United to any corporation or entity into which
United may be merged or consolidate.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Applicable
Law</u>.&nbsp; This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Illinois, and the rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and governed

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Paragraph
Reference</u>.&nbsp; Any reference to paragraphs or subparagraphs shall
be references to paragraphs or subparagraphs of this Agreement unless expressly
stated otherwise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Severability</u>.&nbsp;
If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof is held invalid,
the invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or applications of
this Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid provisions
or application in accordance with the essential intent and purpose of this
Agreement, and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are declared
to be severable.&nbsp; Moreover, if any one or more of the provisions contained
in this Agreement is held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope,
activity or subject, such provisions will be construed by limiting and
reducing them so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible
with applicable law and with the essential intent and purpose of this Agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Supersedes
Prior Agreement(s)</u>.&nbsp; This Agreement supersedes and voids any prior
oral or written agreement relating in any way to Executive's employment
with UA or UAL which may have been entered into between the parties hereto.&nbsp;
Any change to this Agreement after the Effective Date must be in writing
and must be executed by UA, UAL and Executive.
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>No
Mitigation</u>.&nbsp; United agrees that Executive is not required to seek
other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable
to Executive by United pursuant to this Agreement.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement shall not
be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as the result of employment
by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount
claimed to be owed by Executive to United, or otherwise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Arbitration</u>.&nbsp;
Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement

to arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, as set forth above, agrees that judgment
may be entered in the courts of the State of Illinois on any such arbitration
award, consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of Illinois, both state
and federal, for the enforcement of any such arbitration award and agrees
not to disturb such choice of forum.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the above, Executive
further agrees that United may seek temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunctive relief to enforce the provisions contained in Paragraph 6, without
first proceeding to arbitration.
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Representations by United</u>.&nbsp;
United hereby represents and warrants to Executive that; (a) the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by United have been duly authorized
by all necessary actions by United, (b) this Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by United to Executive, and (c) this Agreement constitutes

consulted with others as appropriate, hereby agree to be bound by its terms.
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>No Administrative Claim.</u>

nor any breach thereof, shall give rise to administrative claim under sections
503 or 507 of the Bankruptcy Code and further agrees that he will not assert
an entitlement to such administrative claim the Bankruptcy Court or any
other judicial or arbitral forum.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties
have executed this Agreement effective as of February 19, 2003, at the
