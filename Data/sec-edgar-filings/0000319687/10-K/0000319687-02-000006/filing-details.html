<b></b><p>ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.</p>
<p>	Continental Airlines, Inc. is a major United States air carrier engaged in the business of transporting passengers, cargo and mail.  We are the fifth largest United States airline (as measured by 2001 revenue passenger miles) and, together with our wholly owned subsidiaries, ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (formerly Continental Express, Inc. and referred to in this Form 10-K as "ExpressJet") and Continental Micronesia, Inc. ("CMI"), each a Delaware corporation, served 216 airports worldwide at January 31, 2002.  As of January 31, 2002, we flew to 123 domestic and 93 international destinations and offered additional connecting service through alliances with domestic and foreign carriers. We directly served 15 European cities, seven South American cities, Tel Aviv, Hong Kong and Tokyo as of January 31, 2002, and are one of the leading airlines providing service to Mexico and Central America, serving more destinations there than any other United States airline.  Through our Guam hub, CMI provides extensive service in the western Pacific, including service to more Japanese cities than any other United States carrier.</p>
<p>	As used in this Form&#160;10-K, the terms "Continental", "we", "us", "our" and similar terms refer to Continental Airlines, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.  This Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements.  In connection therewith, please see the cautionary statements contained in Item 1.  "Business - Risk Factors - Terrorist Attacks", "Business - Risk Factors Relating to the Company" and "Business - Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry" which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.</p>
<b></b><p>Recent Developments</p>
<p>	The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 involving commercial aircraft adversely affected our financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and the airline industry generally.  Among the effects we experienced from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were significant flight disruption costs caused by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, imposed grounding of the U.S. airline industry's fleet, significantly increased security, insurance and other costs, significantly higher ticket refunds, significantly reduced load factors, and significantly reduced yields.  As a result, we reduced our flight schedule and furloughed approximately 8,000 employees in connection with the schedule reduction.  For the fourth quarter of 2001, we reduced our systemwide available seat miles by approximately 14.9% as compared with capacity for the same period in the prior year.  Due in part to the lack of predictability of future traffic, business mix and yields, we are currently unable to estimate the long-term impact on us of the events of September 11, 2001 and the sufficiency of our financial resources to absorb that impact.  However, given the magnitude of these unprecedented events and their potential subsequent effects, the adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations and prospects may continue to be material.  See "Employees" and "Risk Factors - Terrorist Attacks" below.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<b></b><p>Domestic Operations</p>
<p>	We operate our domestic route system primarily through our hubs in New York at Newark International Airport ("Newark"), in Houston, Texas at George Bush Intercontinental Airport ("Bush Intercontinental") and in Cleveland, Ohio at Hopkins International Airport ("Hopkins International").  Our hub system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly.  The hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft.  As of January 31, 2002, we operated 61% of the average daily jet departures from Newark, 83% of the average daily jet departures from Bush Intercontinental, and 66% of the average daily jet departures from Hopkins International (in each case including regional jets).  Each of our domestic hubs is located in a large business and population center, contributing to a high volume of "origin and destination" traffic.</p>
<p> <u>ExpressJet</u>.  Our mainline jet service at each of our domestic hub cities is coordinated with ExpressJet, which operates new-generation regional jets and turboprop aircraft under the name "Continental Express."  Effective January 1, 2001, we entered into a capacity purchase agreement with ExpressJet pursuant to which we purchase in advance all of ExpressJet's available seat miles for a negotiated price.  Under the agreement, ExpressJet operates regional flights on our behalf, while we are responsible for all scheduling, pricing and seat inventories, and are entitled to all revenue associated with those flights.  We pay ExpressJet based on scheduled block hours in accordance with a formula designed to provide them with an operating margin of approximately 10% before taking into account variations in some costs and expenses that are generally controllable by ExpressJet.  Accordingly, we assume the risk of revenue volatility associated with fares and passenger traffic, price volatility for specified expense items such as fuel and the cost of all distribution and revenue-related costs.  The capacity purchase agreement replaced our prior revenue-sharing arrangement.</p>
<p>	As of January 31, 2002, ExpressJet served 76 cities in the U.S., 11 cities in Mexico and five cities in Canada by regional jets.  At that date, ExpressJet also served 29 cities by turboprop aircraft.  Additional commuter feed traffic is currently provided to us by other code-sharing partners.  See "Alliances" below.</p>
<p>	We believe ExpressJet's regional jet and turboprop service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects onto our mainline jets and allowing more frequent flights to smaller cities than could be provided economically with conventional jet aircraft. We believe that ExpressJet's regional jets provide greater comfort and enjoy better customer acceptance than turboprop aircraft.  The regional jets also allow ExpressJet to serve certain routes that cannot be served by its turboprop aircraft.  We anticipate that ExpressJet's fleet will be entirely comprised of regional jets by 2003.</p>
<p>	We originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for a public offering of common stock of ExpressJet's parent last summer, but decided to postpone the offering after September 11, 2001 to allow the financial markets to stabilize and to permit the airline industry to begin its recovery from the events of September 11, 2001.  Our current intention is to continue pursuing our strategy of separating the ownership of Continental and ExpressJet by selling a portion of our interest in ExpressJet to the public for cash.</p>
<b></b><p>International Operations</p>
<p>	We directly serve destinations throughout Europe, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean, as well as Tel Aviv, Hong Kong and Tokyo, and have extensive operations in the western Pacific conducted by CMI.  As measured by 2001 available seat miles, approximately 38.0% of our mainline jet operations, including CMI, were dedicated to international traffic.  As of January 31, 2002, we offered 119 weekly departures to 15 European cities and marketed service to 34 other cities through code-sharing agreements. </p>
<p>	Our Newark hub is a significant international gateway.  From Newark at January 31, 2002, we served 15 European cities, five Canadian cities, four Mexican cities, five Central American cities, four South American cities, 11 Caribbean destinations, Tel Aviv, Hong Kong and Tokyo and marketed numerous other destinations through code-sharing arrangements with foreign carriers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Our Houston hub is the focus of our operations in Mexico and Central America.  As of January 31, 2002, we flew from Houston to 20 cities in Mexico, every country in Central America, six cities in South America, two Caribbean destinations, three cities in Canada, two cities in Europe and Tokyo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	We also fly to Montreal, Toronto and two Caribbean destinations from our hub in Cleveland.</p>
<p> <u>Continental Micronesia</u>.  CMI is a United States-certificated air carrier transporting passengers, cargo and mail in the western Pacific.  From its hub operations based on the island of Guam as of January 31, 2002, CMI provided service to eight cities in Japan, more than any other United States carrier, as well as other Pacific rim destinations, including Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Australia and Indonesia. </p>
<p>	CMI is the principal air carrier in the Micronesian Islands, where it pioneered scheduled air service in 1968.  CMI's route system is linked to the United States market through Hong Kong, Tokyo and Honolulu, each of which CMI serves non-stop from Guam.  CMI and Continental also maintain a code-sharing agreement and coordinate schedules on certain flights from the west coast of the United States to Honolulu, and from Honolulu to Guam, to facilitate travel from the United States into CMI's route system.</p>
<b></b><p>Alliances</p>
<p>	We have entered into and continue to develop alliances with domestic carriers.  We have a long-term global alliance  with Northwest Airlines, Inc. ("Northwest Airlines") through 2025, subject to earlier termination by either of us in the event of certain changes in control of either Northwest Airlines or Continental.  The Northwest Alliance provides for each carrier placing its code on a large number of the flights of the other, reciprocity of frequent flyer programs and executive lounge access, and other joint marketing activities.  Northwest Airlines and Continental also have joint contracts with major corporations and travel agents designed to create access to a broader product line encompassing the route systems of both carriers. </p>
<p>	The alliance agreement also provides that subject to certain conditions, including the receipt by Northwest Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and us of an adequate grant of antitrust immunity, we will join, as an economic participant, a new transatlantic joint venture with Northwest Airlines and KLM on terms to be negotiated by the parties in good faith.  If the parties cannot resolve the terms of our entrance into such a joint venture, the terms of our entrance would be determined by arbitration in accordance with the alliance agreement's dispute resolution procedures.  We have not yet applied for such antitrust immunity and neither we nor Northwest has sought to invoke the arbitration provisions relating to our joint venture participation.</p>
<p>	We had originally projected that the Northwest Alliance would generate approximately $225 million of incremental annual operating income for us when fully implemented, which we anticipated would be by the end of 2001.  Due to implementation delays, we subsequently revised that projection to $160 million for 2001 and projected that the full run-rate benefit would be achieved during the next few years.  Due primarily to the effects on our industry of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the actual incremental contribution for 2001 was $140 million, and it is now unclear whether the full projected benefit will be achieved in the future.</p>
<p>	We also have domestic code-sharing agreements with America West Airlines, Inc., Gulfstream International Airlines, Inc., Mesaba Aviation, Inc., Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., Alaska Airlines, Inc., Horizon Airlines, Inc., Champlain Enterprises, Inc. (CommutAir) and American Eagle Airlines, Inc.  We own 28% of the common equity of Gulfstream.</p>
<p>	In addition to our domestic alliances, we seek to develop international alliance relationships that complement our own flying and permit expanded service through our hubs to major international destinations.  International alliances assist in the development of our route structure by enabling us to offer more frequencies in a market, providing passengers connecting service from our international flights to other destinations beyond an alliance partner's hub, and by expanding the product line that we may offer in a foreign destination.</p>
<p>	In October 2001, we announced that we had signed a cooperative marketing agreement with KLM that includes extensive codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer program participation and airport lounge access.  On December 1, 2001, we placed our code on selected flights to more than 30 European destinations operated by KLM and KLM Cityhopper beyond its Amsterdam hub, and KLM placed its code on our flights between New York and Amsterdam, as well as on selected flights to U.S. destinations operated by us beyond our New York and Houston hubs.  In addition, members of each carrier's frequent flyer program are able to earn mileage anywhere on the other's global route network, as well as the global network of Northwest Airlines.  This code-share agreement terminates on March 30, 2002, unless extended by the parties.</p>
<p>	We have also implemented international code-sharing agreements with Air Europa, Air China, Emirates (the flag carrier of the United Arab Emirates),<b> </b>EVA Airways Corporation, an airline based in Taiwan, Virgin Atlantic Airways, Societe Air France ("Air France"), and Compania Panamena de Aviacion, S.A. ("Copa").  We own 49% of the common equity of Copa. </p>
<p>	Some of our code-sharing agreements involve block-space arrangements (under which carriers agree to share capacity and bear economic risk for blocks of seats on certain routes). Continental and Air France purchase blocks of seats on each other's flights between Houston and Newark and Paris.  Continental and Virgin Atlantic Airways exchange seat blocks on each other's flights between Newark and London, and we purchase seat blocks on eight other routes flown by Virgin Atlantic Airways between the United States and the United Kingdom. Our codeshare agreement with Air France will terminate on March 31, 2002.</p>
<b></b><p>Marketing</p>
<p>	As with other carriers, most tickets for travel on us are sold by travel agents.  Travel agents generally receive commissions measured by a certain percentage of the price of tickets sold.  We often pay additional commissions to travel agents in connection with special revenue programs.</p>
<p> <u>E-Ticket</u>.  In 2001, we continued to expand our electronic ticketing, or E-Ticket, product.  E-Tickets result in lower distribution costs to us while providing enhanced customer and revenue information.  We recorded over $5.6 billion in E-Ticket sales in 2001, representing 60% of total sales.  We have currently replaced our airport E-Ticket machines with new state-of-the-art eService Centers, self-service kiosks for customer check-in, in over 90 U.S. airports.  Continental and America West were the first U.S. airlines to implement interline E-Ticketing allowing customers to use electronic tickets when their itineraries include travel on both carriers. We now have interline E-Ticketing arrangements with America West, Northwest Airlines, United Air Lines, Inc. and Gulfstream, and plan to implement interline E-Ticketing with our other alliance partners and some of the other large U.S. carriers.  We expect these features to contribute to an increase in E-Ticket usage and a further reduction in distribution costs.</p>
<p> <u>Internet</u>.  Our award winning website, continental.com, recorded $487 million in ticket sales in 2001, compared with $320 million in ticket sales in 2000. The site offers customers direct access to information such as schedules, reservations, flight status, cargo tracking and Continental Online travel specials, a free weekly e-mail containing special offers for weekend travel. Combined with online travel agents, we recorded $1 billion in ticket sales through the internet during 2001, compared with $665 million in 2000.</p>
<p> <u>Other</u>.  We are using e-commerce to improve our services for the customer and to reduce distribution costs.  Continental, United Air Lines, American Airlines, Inc., Delta Air Lines, Inc. and Northwest Airlines, own a comprehensive travel planning website, ORBITZ, which offers customers unlimited access to a wide variety of unbiased travel options.  To date, 45 U.S. and foreign carriers have joined the web-based travel service.  ORBITZ provides customers with convenient online access to airline, hotel, car rental and other travel services in addition to internet offers.  The site features published fares from virtually all carriers worldwide.  In addition, we have entered into marketing agreements with other web-based travel service companies such as Hotwire, Travelocity and Expedia.</p>
<b></b><p>&#160;</p>
<p>Frequent Flyer Program</p>
<p>	We maintain our "OnePass" frequent flyer program to encourage repeat travel on our system.  OnePass  allows passengers to earn mileage credits by flying us and certain other carriers, including Northwest Airlines, America West Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Alitalia, Air France, Qantas Airways, Copa and Gulfstream.  We also sell mileage credits to credit card companies, phone companies, hotels, car rental agencies and others participating in OnePass.</p>
<p>	Due to the structure of the program and the low level of redemptions as a percentage of total travel, we believe that displacement of revenue passengers by passengers using flight awards has historically been minimal.  The number of awards used on us represented 7.3% of our total revenue passenger miles in 2001.</p>
<b></b><p>Employees</p>
<p>	As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately 42,900 full-time equivalent employees, including approximately 17,850 customer service agents, reservations agents, ramp and other airport personnel, 7,660 flight attendants, 6,790 management and clerical employees, 6,150 pilots, 4,300 mechanics and 150 dispatchers.  Labor costs are a significant component of our expenses and can substantially impact airline results.  In 2001, labor costs (including employee incentives) constituted 33.1% of our total operating expenses, excluding special charges and a grant under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the "Stabilization Act").  While there can be no assurance that our generally good labor relations and high labor productivity will continue, we have established as a significant component of our business strategy the preservation of good relations with our employees, approximately 44% of whom are represented by unions.</p>
<p>	As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we expected to furlough approximately 12,000 employees.  We were able to reduce our original estimate to 8,000, of which approximately 55% accepted company-offered leaves of absence or retirements.  We have recalled several hundred employees primarily to assist in enhanced security requirements at airports.</p>
<p>	See Item 7.  "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a table of Continental's, ExpressJet's and CMI's principal collective bargaining agreements, and their respective amendable dates.</p>
<b></b><p>Industry Regulation and Airport Access</p>
<p>	We and our subsidiaries operate under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the Department of Transportation, or DOT.  Such certificates may be altered, amended, modified or suspended by the DOT if public convenience and necessity so require, or may be revoked for intentional failure to comply with the terms and conditions of a certificate.  </p>
<p>	The airlines are also regulated by the FAA, primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance, ground facilities and other technical matters.  Pursuant to these regulations, we have established, and the FAA has approved, a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate that provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls. </p>
<p>	The DOT allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems, provided such procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system.  Certain airports, including the major airports at Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County (California) and San Francisco, have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations.  In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increases in operating costs, and such restrictions could limit our ability to expand our operations at the affected airports.  Local authorities at other airports are considering adopting similar noise regulations.</p>
<p>	Airports from time to time seek to increase the rates charged to airlines, and the ability of airlines to contest such increases has been restricted by federal legislation, DOT regulations and judicial decisions. Most recently, under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the "Aviation Security Act"), funding for airline and airport security is provided in part by a new $2.50 per enplanement ticket tax.  The Aviation Security Act also allows the Department of Transportation to assess each airline fees that could total the amount spent by that airline on screening services in 2000.  Additionally, because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since September 11, 2001, and because reduced landing weights since September 11, 2001 have reduced the fees airlines pay to airports, many airports are significantly increasing their rates and charges to air carriers.  Some public airports impose passenger facility charges of up to $4.50 per segment for a maximum of $18 per roundtrip.  With certain exceptions, these charges are passed on to customers.</p>
<p>	The FAA has designated John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C. as "high density traffic airports" and has limited the number of departure and arrival slots at those airports.  In April 2000, legislation was signed phasing out slot restrictions beginning in 2001 at O'Hare, LaGuardia and Kennedy.  All slots at O'Hare are scheduled to be eliminated by July 2002 and slots at LaGuardia and Kennedy are scheduled to be eliminated by 2007.  The elimination of slots has had no material impact on us.</p>
<p>	On April 14, 2000, the DOT implemented legislation which exempted from slot requirements service between high-density airports (except at Reagan National) and small cities using small aircraft.  After the commencement of such operations, however, the FAA required airlines to reduce the number of flights operated at LaGuardia pursuant to the new legislation to reduce congestion and delays, and it seems likely such restrictions will continue.</p>
<p>	Reagan National was closed to air service from September 11, 2001 through October 4, 2001, and the government is permitting service to be recommenced in phases.  As of December 31, 2001, we were servicing Reagan National out of our New York and Houston hubs.  Service out of Cleveland resumed in January 2002.</p>
<p>	The availability of international routes to U.S. carriers is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the United States and foreign governments.  The United States typically follows the practice of encouraging foreign governments to accept multiple carrier designation on foreign routes, although certain countries have sought to limit the number of carriers.  Foreign route authorities may become less valuable to the extent that the United States and other countries adopt "open skies" policies liberalizing entry on international routes.  We cannot predict what laws and regulations will be adopted or their impact, but the impact could be significant.</p>
<p>	Many aspects of operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting the environment.  Future regulatory developments could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry.</p>
<b></b><p>Risk Factors - Terrorist Attacks</p>
<p>	The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 involving commercial aircraft adversely affected our financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and the airline industry generally.  Those effects continue, although they have been mitigated somewhat by increased traffic, the Stabilization Act and our cost-cutting measures.  Moreover, additional terrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of such attacks, could further negatively impact us and the airline industry.</p>
<p>	Among the effects we experienced from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were significant flight disruption costs caused by the FAA-imposed grounding of the U.S. airline industry's fleet, significantly increased security, insurance and other costs, significantly higher ticket refunds, significantly reduced load factors, and significantly reduced yields.  Further terrorist attacks using commercial aircraft could result in another grounding of our fleet, and would likely result in significant reductions in load factor and yields, along with increased ticket refunds and security, insurance and other costs.  In addition, terrorist attacks not involving commercial aircraft, or other world events, could result in decreased load factors and yields for airlines, including us, and could also result in increased costs.  For instance, fuel costs, which have declined since September 11, 2001, could escalate if oil-producing countries were impacted by hostilities or reduce output, which could also impact fuel availability. In February 2002, we purchased out of the money call options to hedge a significant increase in fuel costs for approximately 35% of our projected 2002 fuel requirements for the period March through December.  Premiums for aviation insurance have increased substantially, and could escalate further, or certain aviation insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage that are insufficient to comply with the levels of insurance coverage required by aircraft lenders and lessors or required by applicable government regulations.  Additionally, war-risk coverage or other insurance might cease to be available to our vendors, or might be available only at significantly increased premiums or for reduced amounts of coverage, which could adversely impact our operations or costs.</p>
<p>	Due in part to the lack of predictability of future traffic, business mix and yields, we are currently unable to estimate the long-term impact on us of the events of September 11, 2001 and the sufficiency of our financial resources to absorb that impact.  However, given the magnitude of these unprecedented events and their potential subsequent effects, the adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations and prospects may continue to be material.</p>
<p> <u>We may have to recognize further special charges related to grounded aircraft</u>.  As of January 31, 2002, we had 56 jet aircraft and 19 turboprop aircraft out of service from our fleet.  The majority of these aircraft have been temporarily removed from service and we will continue to evaluate whether to return these temporarily grounded aircraft to service, which will primarily depend on demand and yield in the coming months.  It is possible that all or a significant portion of these temporarily grounded aircraft will be permanently removed from service at a later date, which would result in special charges for impairment and lease exit costs.  In the fourth quarter of 2001, we incurred a special charge of $61 million ($39 million after taxes) associated primarily with the impairment of various owned aircraft and spare engines, including all of the DC-10-30, ATR-42, EMB-120, and Boeing 747 and 727 aircraft we owned. We could suffer additional impairment of operating aircraft and other long-lived assets in the future if the economic environment in which we operate does not continue to improve or further deteriorates due to unforeseen circumstances.  The special charges for all or a significant portion of the temporarily grounded aircraft would, and any additional special charges for impairment of operating aircraft and other long-lived assets could, be material.</p>
<p> <u>The Aviation Security Act will impose additional costs and may cause service disruptions</u>.  In November 2001, the President signed into law the Aviation Security Act.  This law federalizes substantially all aspects of civil aviation security, creating a new Transportation Security Administration under the Department of Transportation.  Under the Aviation Security Act, all security screeners at airports will be federal employees, and significant other elements of airline and airport security will be overseen and performed by federal employees, including federal security managers, federal law enforcement officers, federal air marshals, and federal security screeners. Among other matters, the law mandates improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals onboard flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to U.S. Customs, and enhanced background checks.  Funding for airline and airport security under the law is provided by a new $2.50 per enplanement ticket tax (subject to a $5 per one-way trip cap), and a new annual tax on air carriers in an amount not to exceed the amounts paid in calendar year 2000 by carriers for screening passengers and property.  Air carriers began collecting the new ticket tax from passengers, and became subject to the new tax on air carriers, on February 1, 2002.  The law requires that the Undersecretary of Transportation for Security will assume all the civil aviation security functions and responsibilities related to passenger screening called for under the law beginning February 17, 2002, and provides that the Undersecretary may assume existing contracts for the provision of passenger screening services at U.S. airports for up to 270 days from that date, after which all security screeners must be federal employees.  The law also requires that all checked baggage  be screened by explosive detection systems by December 31, 2002, which will require significant equipment acquisitions by the government and may require facility and baggage process changes to implement.  Implementation of the requirements of the Aviation Security Act will result in increased costs for us and our passengers and may result in delays and disruptions to air travel.</p>

<p>Risk Factors Relating to the Company</p>
<p> <u>We continue to experience significant operating losses</u>.  Since September 11, 2001, we have not generated positive cash flow from our operations.  Although improved traffic since September has significantly decreased the average daily negative cash flow from operations, our cash flow from operations as of February 20, 2002, remains negative at approximately $2 million per day, and we currently anticipate that we will incur a significant loss in the first quarter of 2002.  We also expect to incur a loss for the fourth quarter of 2002 and for the full year 2002.  Although load factors continue to improve, they have done so against significantly reduced capacity.  The reduced capacity, coupled with the fact that many of our costs are fixed in the intermediate to long term, will continue to cause higher unit costs.  Cost per available seat mile for 2002 is expected to increase 5%, holding fuel rate constant, as compared to 2001. This increase is partly attributable to anticipated additional insurance costs in 2002 of approximately $85 million.  Business traffic in most markets continues to be weak, and carriers continue to offer reduced fares to attract passengers, which lowers our passenger revenue and yields and raises our break-even load factor. We cannot predict when business traffic or yields will increase.</p>
<p>	In addition, our capacity purchase agreement with ExpressJet provides that we purchase in advance all of its available seat miles for a negotiated price, and we are at risk for reselling the available seat miles at market prices.  We previously announced our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of our interests in ExpressJet.  If we do so, then we would have greater fixed costs, which could result in lower or more volatile earnings or both.  For example, for the year ended December 31, 2001, our pre-tax net loss of approximately $114 million included pre-tax net income for ExpressJet of approximately $80 million.</p>
<p> <u>Our high leverage may affect our ability to satisfy our significant financing needs or meet our obligations</u>. We have a higher proportion of debt compared to our equity capital than some of our principal competitors.  We also have significant operating leases and facility rental costs.  In addition, we have fewer cash resources than some of our principal competitors. Most of our property and equipment is subject to liens securing indebtedness.  Accordingly, we may be less able than some of our competitors to withstand a prolonged recession in the airline industry or respond as flexibly to changing economic and competitive conditions.</p>
<p>	As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately $4.6 billion (including current maturities) of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, $250 million liquidation amount of Continental-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trust ($243 million net of unamortized discount), and $1.2 billion of stockholders' equity.  We have substantial commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft.  As of December 31, 2001, we had firm commitments for 87 aircraft from Boeing, with an estimated cost of approximately $3.7 billion, after giving effect to the rescheduling discussed below.  We expect that 20 of these aircraft will be delivered between January 2002 and May 2002.  Thirteen of these 20 aircraft have been pre-financed, and we expect to finance the remaining seven aircraft.  We have agreed with Boeing to reschedule deliveries of the remaining 67 aircraft so that they will be delivered between late 2003 and mid 2008.  We do not have backstop financing from Boeing or any other financing currently in place for the remaining 67 aircraft.</p>
<p>	As of December 31, 2001, ExpressJet had firm commitments for 137 regional jets from Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A. ("Embraer"), with an estimated cost of approximately $2.6 billion. We do not have any obligation to take any of these firm Embraer aircraft that are not financed by a third party and leased to us.</p>
<p>	In addition, we have significant operating lease and facility rental obligations.  For the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, cash expenditures under operating leases approximated $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>	Additional financing will be needed to satisfy our capital commitments.  We cannot predict whether sufficient financing will be available for capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments.  On several occasions subsequent to September 11, 2001, each of Moody's Investors Service, Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ibca, Duff &amp; Phelps downgraded the credit ratings of a number of major airlines, including our credit ratings. Reductions in our credit ratings may increase the cost and reduce the availability of financing to us.</p>
<p> <u>Significant changes or extended periods of high fuel costs would materially affect our operating results</u>.  Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our operating expense.  Fuel costs represented approximately 13.5% of our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 (excluding severance and other special charges and Stabilization Act grant) and 15.2% of our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000.  Fuel prices and supplies are influenced significantly by international political and economic circumstances. From time to time we enter into petroleum swap contracts, petroleum call option contracts and/or jet fuel purchase commitments to provide some short-term protection (generally three to six months) against a sharp increase in jet fuel prices. Our fuel hedging strategy may limit our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices.  In February 2002, we purchased out of the money call options to hedge a significant increase in fuel costs for approximately 35% of our projected 2002 fuel requirements for the period March through December.  If a fuel supply shortage were to arise from OPEC production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, higher fuel prices or reduction of scheduled airline service could result.  Significant changes in fuel costs or extended periods of high jet fuel prices would materially affect our operating results.</p>
<p> <u>Labor costs impact our results of operations</u>.  Labor costs constitute a significant percentage of our total operating costs.  In July 2000, we completed a three-year program bringing all employees to industry standard wages and also announced and began implementing a phased plan to bring employee benefits to industry standard levels by 2003.  The plan provides for increases in vacation, paid holidays, increased 401(k) matching cash contributions and additional past service retirement credit for most senior employees.</p>
<p>	Collective bargaining agreements between us and our mechanics (who are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters) and between both us and ExpressJet and our respective pilots (who are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association) are amendable in January 2002 and October 2002, respectively.  Negotiations were deferred due to the economic uncertainty following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  Negotiations with these employee groups have recommenced with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in the first quarter of 2002 and are scheduled to commence with the Air Line Pilots Association in the summer of 2002.  We will incur increased labor costs in connection with the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements.  In addition, certain other U.S. air carriers have experienced work slowdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions in connection with contract negotiations.  Although we enjoy generally good relations with our employees, there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disruptions in the future.</p>
<p> <u>Our ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards or investment tax credits may be limited by certain events</u>.  At December 31, 2001, we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") of $1.5 billion for federal income tax purposes that will expire through 2022 and federal investment tax credit carryforwards of $27 million that will expire through 2002.  Due to a change in our ownership on April 27, 1993, the ultimate utilization of our NOLs and investment tax credits may be limited, as described below.  </p>
<p>	Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 382") imposes limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an "ownership change."  In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period.  In the event that an ownership change occurred, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate (which is 4.82% for January 2002).  Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in assets held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change.  Under current conditions, if an ownership change were to occur, our annual NOL utilization would be limited to approximately $93 million per year other than through the recognition of future built-in gain transactions.</p>
<p>	In November 1998, Northwest Airlines Corporation completed its acquisition of certain equity interests in us previously held by Air Partners, L.P. and its affiliates, together with shares of our Class A common stock held by other investors, totaling 8,661,224 shares of the Class A common stock. On January 22, 2001, we repurchased 6,685,279 shares of our Class A common stock from Northwest Airlines Corporation and an affiliate.  In addition, each issued share of our Class A common stock was reclassified into 1.32 shares of Class B common stock in a nontaxable transaction.  We do not believe that these transactions resulted in an ownership change for purposes of Section 382.</p>
<p> <u>Continental Micronesia's dependence on the Japanese economy may result in currency risk</u>.  Because the majority of CMI's traffic originates in Japan, its results of operations are substantially affected by the Japanese economy and changes in the value of the yen as compared to the U.S. dollar.  To reduce the potential negative impact on CMI's earnings associated with fluctuations in currency, we have entered into forward contracts as a hedge against a portion of our expected net yen cash flow position.  As of December 31, 2001, we had hedged approximately 80% of 2002 projected yen-denominated net cash flows at a weighted average rate of 116 yen to $1 US.</p>
<b></b><p>&#160;</p>
<p>Risks Factors Relating to the Airline Industry</p>
<p> <u>The industry in which we compete is highly competitive</u>.  The airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting.  Carriers use discount fares to stimulate traffic during periods of slack demand, to generate cash flow and to increase market share.  Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources or lower cost structures than we do.</p>
<p>	Airline profit levels are highly sensitive to changes in fuel costs, fare levels and passenger demand.  Passenger demand and fare levels are influenced by, among other things, the state of the global economy, domestic and international events, airline capacity and pricing actions taken by carriers.  The weak U.S. economy, turbulent international events and extensive price discounting by carriers contributed to unprecedented losses for U.S. airlines from 1990 to 1993.  Since September 11, 2001, these same factors, together with the effects of the terrorist attacks and the industry's reduction in capacity, have resulted in dramatic losses for us and the airline industry generally.  We cannot predict when conditions will improve.</p>
<p>	In recent years, the major U.S. airlines have sought to form marketing alliances with other U.S. and foreign air carriers.  Such alliances generally provide for code-sharing, frequent flyer reciprocity, coordinated scheduling of flights of each alliance member to permit convenient connections and other joint marketing activities.  Such arrangements permit an airline to market flights operated by other alliance members as its own.  This increases the destinations, connections and frequencies offered by the airline, which provide an opportunity to increase traffic on its segment of flights connecting with its alliance partners.  Our alliance with Northwest Airlines is an example of such an arrangement, and we have existing alliances with numerous other air carriers.  Other major U.S. airlines have alliances or planned alliances more extensive than ours.  We cannot predict the extent to which we will be disadvantaged by competing alliances.</p>
<p>	Since its deregulation in 1978, the U.S. airline industry has undergone substantial consolidation, and it may in the future experience additional consolidation.  We routinely monitor changes in the competitive landscape and engage in analysis and discussions regarding our strategic position, including alliances and business combination transactions.  We have had, and expect to continue to have, discussions with third parties regarding strategic alternatives.  The impact of any consolidation within the U.S. airline industry cannot be predicted at this time.</p>
<p> <u>Our business is subject to extensive government regulation</u>.  As evidenced by the enactment of the Aviation Security Act, airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs.  The FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures.  Some FAA requirements cover, among other things, retirement of older aircraft, security measures, collision avoidance systems, airborne windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement and other environmental concerns, commuter aircraft safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft.  We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations.  </p>
<p>	Additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. Additionally, because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since September 11, 2001, and because reduced landing weights since September 11, 2001 have reduced the fees airlines pay to airports, many airports are significantly increasing their rates and charges to air carriers, including to us.  Restrictions on the ownership and transfer of airline routes and takeoff and landing slots have also been proposed.  See "Industry Regulation and Airport Access" above.  The ability of U.S. carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the United States and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, or because appropriate slots or facilities are not made available.  We cannot provide assurance that laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect us.</p>
<p> <u>Our operations are affected by the seasonality associated with the airline industry</u>.  Due to greater demand for air travel during the summer months, revenue in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year is generally stronger than revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year for most U.S. air carriers.  Our results of operations generally reflect this seasonality, but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal, including the extent and nature of competition from other airlines, fare actions, excise and similar taxes, changing levels of operations, fuel prices, weather, air traffic control delays, foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions.</p>

<p>	Most of the aircraft and engines we own are subject to mortgages.</p>
<p>	During 2001, we put into service a total of 36 new Boeing aircraft which consisted of two 767-400ER aircraft, seven 767-200ER aircraft, two 757-300 aircraft, ten 737-900 aircraft and 15 737-800 aircraft.  During late 2001, we converted eight firm commitments for Boeing 767 aircraft into 22 firm commitments for Boeing 737 aircraft.  ExpressJet took delivery of 29 ERJ-145 aircraft and 12 ERJ-135 aircraft in 2001.  We removed from service 17 DC-10-30 aircraft, 32 MD-80 aircraft and six 737-300 aircraft in 2001.  ExpressJet removed from service six ATR-42 aircraft, 12 EMB-120 aircraft and 19 Beech 1900 aircraft in 2001.</p>
<p>	We anticipate taking delivery of 20 Boeing jet aircraft in 2002 and the remainder of our firm orders through 2008.  Also in 2002, we plan to retire from service 18 jet aircraft, the leases for which expire in 2002.</p>
<p>	ExpressJet anticipates taking delivery of 51 Embraer regional jet aircraft in 2002 and the remainder of its firm orders through the first quarter of 2005.  We plan to retire 27 turboprop aircraft in 2002 and the remaining turboprop aircraft in 2003.</p>
<p>	See Item 7.  "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -  Liquidity and Capital Commitments" for a discussion of our order for new firm commitment aircraft and related financing arrangements.</p>
<b></b><p>Facilities</p>
<p>	Our principal facilities are located at Newark, Bush Intercontinental, Hopkins International and A.B. Won Pat International Airport in Guam.  Substantially all of these facilities and our other facilities are leased on a long-term, net-rental basis, and we are responsible for maintenance, taxes, insurance and other facility-related expenses and services. At each of our  three domestic hub cities and most other locations, our passenger and baggage handling space is leased directly from the airport authority on varying terms dependent on prevailing practice at each airport.  We also maintain administrative offices, airport and terminal facilities, training facilities and other facilities related to the airline business in the cities we serve.</p>
<p>	We have entered into agreements with the cities of Houston, Texas and Cleveland, Ohio, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Hawaii Department of Transportation, the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation (in Los Angeles, California), and the Harris County (Houston) Industrial Development Corporation to provide funds for constructing, improving and modifying facilities that have been or will be leased to us and for acquiring related equipment.  In connection therewith, we have unconditionally guaranteed the principal and interest on tax-exempt bonds issued by  these entities with a par value in an original principal amount of approximately $1.6 billion (excluding the City of Houston bonds referenced below) and entered into long-term leases with the respective authorities under which rental payments will be sufficient to service the related bonds.  The leases generally have terms ranging from 20 to 30 years.</p>
<p>	During 2001, construction continued under Continental's Global Gateway Program at Newark International Airport.  The program includes construction of a new concourse in Terminal C, which opened in December 2001, a new federal inspection services facility for processing arriving international passengers, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2002, and other facility improvements.  The remaining portions of the Global Gateway Program are expected to be completed during 2002.  </p>
<p>In August 2001, the City of Houston completed the offering of $324 million aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds to finance the construction of Terminal E at Bush Intercontinental Airport.  In connection therewith, we entered into a long-term lease with the City of Houston requiring that upon completion of construction, with limited exceptions, we will make rental payments sufficient to service the related tax-exempt bonds through their maturity in 2029. Approximately $27 million of the bond proceeds have been expended as of December 31, 2001.   During the construction period, we maintain certain risks related to our own actions or inactions while managing portions of the construction.  Potential obligations associated with these risks are generally limited based upon certain percentages of construction costs incurred to date.  We have also entered into a binding corporate guaranty with the bond trustee for the repayment of the principal and interest on the bonds that becomes effective upon the occurrence of the completion of construction, our failure to comply with the lease agreement (which is within our control), or our termination of the lease agreement.  Further, we have not assumed any condemnation risk, any casualty event risk (unless caused by us), or risk related to certain cost overruns (and in the case of cost overruns, our liability for the project would be limited to 89.9% of the capitalized costs) during the construction period.  Accordingly, we are not considered the owner of the project and, therefore, have not capitalized the construction costs or recorded the debt obligation in our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>	We have cargo facilities at Los Angeles International Airport, which we sublease to another carrier.  If the carrier failed to comply with its obligations under the sublease, we would be required to perform those obligations.  We have guaranteed the repayment of principal and interest on $24 million par value bonds related to this facility, which amount is included in our total $1.6 billion guaranteed obligations described above.</p>
<p>	We remain contingently liable until December 1, 2015, for US Airways, Inc.'s obligations under a lease agreement between US Airways and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey related to the East End Terminal at LaGuardia airport.  These obligations include the payment of ground rentals to the Port Authority and the payment of principal and interest on $189 million par value special facilities revenue bonds issued by the Port Authority, which amount is included in our total $1.6 billion guaranteed obligations described above.  If US Airways defaulted on these obligations, we could be required to cure the default, at which time we would have the right to occupy the terminal.</p>

<b></b><p>ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.</p>
<b></b><p>Legal Proceedings</p>
<p>	On July 25, 2000, a Concorde aircraft operated by Air France crashed shortly after takeoff from France's Charles de Gaulle airport, killing 114 people, most of whom were tourists on board the chartered aircraft, which was also destroyed.  The final investigative report of the French authorities, issued January 15, 2002, suggests that one of the aircraft's tires burst after running over a small piece of metal believed by investigators to have come from one of our DC-10 aircraft that had taken off on the same runway a short time before the Concorde and that portions of the resulting debris struck the underside of a wing of the aircraft which caused the rupture of a fuel tank, leading to a fire and the crash.  </p>
<p>	The following lawsuits involving us are pending in connection with the accident: <u>Air France and its Insurers v. Continental Airlines, Inc., USAU, Inc, and USAIG</u> filed on September 15, 2000 before the Commercial Court of Pontoise, France, in which the plaintiffs seek damages for indemnification paid to the passengers' families and other parties, for destruction of the aircraft, and for any other expenses and costs incurred by Air France; and Cause No. 2001-37394, <u>Phillippe Fournel</u>, et al. <u>Plaintiffs v. Continental Airlines, Inc. and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company</u>, <u>Defendants v. Air France S.A., BAE Systems PLC, British Aerospace Corporation, European Aeronautic Defense &amp; Space Company, N.V. and Aerospatiale Matra S.A., Third Party Defendants</u>, filed on July 25, 2001 in the 281<sup>st</sup> Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, in which plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages in connection with the deaths of five crew members on board the Concorde.</p>
<p>	The foregoing cases are in preliminary stages.  Although the outcome of such suits or any future litigation cannot be known at this time, our costs to defend these matters and, we believe, any potential liability exposure is covered by insurance.  Consequently, we do not expect the foregoing litigation or any additional suits that may arise from the accident to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.</p>
<p>	Two cases previously disclosed in our reports have been dismissed.  Case No. </p>
<p>00-07707, <u>In re: Petition of Ina Frentzen, Rita Frentzen-Bien, and Ralf Frentzen Requesting Depositions Before Suit</u> filed on September 29, 2000 in the District Court for Dallas County, Texas, D-95th Judicial District (Parties in interest include Continental Airlines, Inc. and The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company), in which the plaintiffs sought to depose certain parties, including our officers and employees, prior to determining whether to file suit against us and certain other parties, was dismissed by the District Court on June 20, 2001 in connection with a settlement agreement among the parties and certain insurers.  Case No. 01CIV.0149, <u>Dr. Hans-Joachim Schnitter, Dietmar Schnitter, Kerstin Hoffman, Carola Wagner and Annette Friedland v. Air France, S.A., Continental Airlines, Inc., BAE Systems plc, European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company N.V., The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, General Electric Company, MRA Systems, Inc.</u>, filed on January 9, 2001 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which the plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages in connection with the deaths of three passengers on board the Concorde, was dismissed by the District Court on June 21, 2001 in connection with a settlement agreement among the parties and certain insurers.</p>
<b>
</b><p>Environmental Proceedings</p>
<p>	Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (commonly known as "Superfund") and similar state environment cleanup laws, generators of waste disposed of at designated sites may, under certain circumstances, be subject to joint and several liability for investigation and remediation costs. We (including our predecessors) have been identified as a potentially responsible party at six federal and two state sites that are undergoing or have undergone investigation or remediation.  We have entered into a settlement agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") with respect to five of the federal sites.  The settlement agreement provides for the EPA to receive an allowed unsecured claim of approximately $1.3 million under our 1993 Plan of Reorganization and approximately $230,000 in cash, in full satisfaction of any and all of our liabilities relating to such sites.  In addition, we have settled one of the state sites for a de minimis amount.  With respect to the remaining sites, we believe that, although applicable case law is evolving and some cases may be interpreted to the contrary, some or all of any liability claims associated with these sites were discharged by confirmation of our 1993 Plan of Reorganization, principally because our exposure is based on alleged offsite disposal known as of the date of confirmation.  Even if any such claims were not discharged, on the basis of currently available information, we believe that our potential liability for our allocable share of the cost to remedy each site (to the extent we are found to have liability) is not, in the aggregate, material; however, we have not been designated a "de minimis" contributor at any of such sites.</p>
<p>	We are also and may from time to time become involved in other environmental matters, including the investigation and/or remediation of environmental conditions at properties we use or previously used.  In 2001, we recorded a charge of $17 million, net of anticipated insurance recoveries, to provide additional reserves for potential environmental remediation costs.  See Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Environmental Matters".  Although we are not currently subject to any environmental cleanup orders imposed by regulatory authorities, we are undertaking voluntary investigation or remediation at certain properties in consultation with such authorities.  The full nature and extent of any contamination at these properties and the parties responsible for such contamination have not been determined, but based on currently available information and our current reserves, we do not believe that any environmental liability associated with such properties will have a material adverse effect on us. </p>
<b></b><p>General</p>
<p>	Various other claims and lawsuits against us are pending that are of the type generally consistent with our business.  We cannot at this time reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could be experienced if any of the claims were successful. Many of such claims and lawsuits are covered in whole or in part by insurance.  We do not believe that the foregoing matters will have a material adverse effect on us.</p>

<p>	As of February 8, 2002, there were approximately 13,499 holders of record of our common stock.</p>
<p>	We have paid no cash dividends on our common stock and have no current intention of doing so.  We began a stock repurchase program in 1998 under which we repurchased a total of 28.2 million shares of Class B common stock for a total of approximately $1.2 billion through December 31, 2001.  Approximately $216 million remained available in the program as of December 31, 2001, although the program has been suspended.  In addition to the current balance, the program permits (i) one-half of future net income (excluding special gains and charges), (ii) all the proceeds from the sale of non-strategic assets and (iii) the amount of cash proceeds we receive for the purchase of common stock by employees and other participants under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans to be added to the program.  Certain of our credit agreements restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or repurchase capital stock by imposing minimum unrestricted cash requirements on us, limiting the amount of such dividends and repurchases when aggregated with certain other payments or distributions.</p>
<p>	Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that no shares of capital stock may be voted by or at the direction of persons who are not United States citizens unless such shares are registered on a separate stock record.  Our Bylaws further provide that no shares will be registered on such separate stock record if the amount so registered would exceed United States foreign ownership restrictions. United States law currently limits to 25% the voting power in us (or any other U.S. airline) of persons who are not citizens of the United States.</p>

<b></b><p>ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL </p>
<p>  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.</p>
<p>	The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements.  In connection therewith, please see the cautionary statements contained in Item 1.  "Business - Risk Factors - Terrorist Attacks", "Business - Risk Factors Relating to the Company" and  "Business - Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry" which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  Hereinafter, the terms "Continental", "we", "us", "our" and similar terms refer to Continental Airlines, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>	We incurred a consolidated net loss of $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to consolidated net income of $342 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.  Results for 2001 included a $146 million charge for fleet impairment losses, costs associated with furloughs and company-offered leaves, a charge for environmental remediation, costs associated with the closure and nonutilization of certain facilities and for some of our uncollectible receivables and charges related to the impairment of investments in some of our affiliates and the uncollectibility of related notes receivable.  In addition, 2001 results included a $417 million grant under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the "Stabilization Act").  Under the Stabilization Act, the federal government is entitled to audit our books and records to ensure that we had adequate losses to justify the size of the government grant and may reduce the amount of grant if the government determines that such losses do not justify the size of the grant.</p>
<p>	Although traffic on many of our flights has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity since September 11, 2001, yields remain low, resulting in revenue per available seat mile, or RASM, being significantly below levels in the comparable periods in 2000 and significantly below the levels we forecasted prior to September 11, 2001.  Our systemwide (mainline jet) RASM for the period between September 11 and December 31, 2001 was approximately 21% lower than our systemwide RASM for the comparable period in 2000, and our estimated systemwide RASM for January 2002 was 14 percent lower than our systemwide RASM for January 2001.  Moreover, certain routes, such as the transpacific and transatlantic routes, have been more adversely affected by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks than our U.S. domestic or other routes.  The reduced systemwide RASM results from lower load factors following the terrorist attacks, a worsening of the general economic slowdown that already impacted our business prior to the attacks, corporate travel restrictions imposed by a number of companies in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, and various fare sales designed to encourage passengers to travel after the attacks.  Although we have taken aggressive action to reduce costs, including significant reductions in workforce, many of our costs are fixed over the intermediate to longer term, so we cannot reduce costs as quickly as we reduce capacity.</p>
<p>	The long-term impact on us of the terrorist attacks and their aftermath and the sufficiency of our financial resources to absorb that impact will depend on a number of factors, including:  (1) the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks on the economy in general; (2) the level of air travel demand, business mix and yields; (3) our ability to reduce operating costs and conserve our financial resources, taking into account the increased costs we will incur as a consequence of the attacks, including those referred to herein, (4) the higher costs associated with new Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, security directives, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the "Aviation Security Act") and any other increased regulation of air carriers; (5) the higher costs of aviation insurance coverage, and the extent to which such insurance (and war risk coverage for vendors) will continue to be commercially available to us and our vendors; (6) our ability to reduce costs to a level that takes into account our significantly reduced operations, and the timing of those cost reductions; (7) our ability to raise financing in light of the various factors referred to herein; (8) the price and availability of jet fuel, and the availability to us of fuel hedges in light of current industry conditions; (9) the extent of any uncompensated losses we experience as a result of the terrorist attacks and their aftermath, including any shutdown by the government of the U.S. air traffic system; (10) any further declines in the values of the aircraft in our fleet; (11) the extent of the benefits we received under the Stabilization Act, taking into account any possible challenges to and interpretations or possible amendments of the Stabilization Act or regulations issued pursuant thereto; and (12) our ability to retain management and other employees in light of current industry conditions and their impact on compensation and morale.</p>
<p>	As described in Item 1.  Business.  "Recent Developments," the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 involving commercial aircraft have had adverse effects on us and the airline industry generally.  Among the effects we have experienced from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks are significant flight disruption costs caused by the FAA-imposed grounding of the U.S. airline industry's fleet, significantly increased security, insurance and other costs, significantly higher ticket refunds, significantly reduced load factors, and significantly reduced yields.  Further terrorist attacks using commercial aircraft could result in another grounding of our fleet, and would likely result in significant reductions in load factor and yields, along with increased ticket refunds and security, insurance and other costs.  In addition, terrorist attacks not involving commercial aircraft, or other events could result in decreased load factors and yields for airlines, including us, and could also result in increased costs.  For instance, fuel costs, which have declined since September 11, 2001, could escalate if oil-producing countries are impacted by hostilities or reduce output, which could also impact fuel availability. In February 2002, we purchased out of the money call options to hedge a significant increase in fuel costs for approximately 35% of our projected 2002 fuel requirements for the period March through December.  Premiums for aviation insurance have increased substantially, and could escalate further, or certain aviation insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage that are insufficient to comply with the levels of insurance coverage required by aircraft lenders and lessors or required by regulations.  Additionally, war risk coverage or other insurance might cease to be available to our vendors, or might be available only at significantly increased premiums or for reduced amounts of coverage, which could adversely impact our operations or costs.  Among other matters, the Aviation Security Act mandates improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals onboard flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to U.S. Customs, and enhanced background checks.  Implementation of the requirements of the Aviation Security Act will result in increased costs for us and our passengers and may result in delays and disruptions to air travel.  Additionally, because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports after September 11, 2001, and because reduced landing weights since September 11, 2001 have reduced the fees airlines pay to airports, many airports are significantly increasing their rates and charges to air carriers, including to us.</p>
<p>	Although the adverse effects described above continue, mitigated somewhat by recently increased traffic, the Stabilization Act and our cost-cutting measures, additional terrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of such attacks, could further negatively impact us and the airline industry.</p>
<p>	Due in part to the lack of predictability of future traffic, business mix and yields, we are currently unable to estimate the long-term impact on us of the events of September 11, 2001 and the sufficiency of our financial resources to absorb that impact.  However, given the magnitude of these unprecedented events and their potential subsequent effects, the adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be material.</p>
<b></b><p>Results of Operations</p>
<p>	The following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and reasons for material changes therein for the three years ended December&#160;31, 2001.</p>
<p> <u>Comparison of 2001 to 2000</u>.  Passenger revenue decreased 9.1%, $851 million, during 2001 as compared to 2000, which was principally due to a decrease in both traffic and yields subsequent to the September 11, 2001 attacks, as well as lower yields that had been affecting our business prior to the attacks.</p>
<p>	Cargo, mail and other revenue decreased 13.4%, $79 million, in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to lower contract revenue from outside ground handling, lower freight and mail due to lower international volumes and security restrictions on our ability to carry freight and mail after the terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>	Wages, salaries and related costs increased 5.1%, $146 million, during 2001 as compared to 2000, primarily due to higher wage rates.  On September 15, 2001, we announced that we would be forced to furlough approximately 12,000 employees in connection with the reduction of our flight schedule in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, although we were able to reduce our original estimate to 8,000.  Approximately 55% of furloughed employees accepted company-offered leaves of absence and retirements and we have recalled several hundred employees primarily to assist in enhanced security requirements at airports.  Severance costs and related company-offered benefits are included in fleet impairment losses, severance and other special charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.</p>
<p>	Aircraft fuel expense decreased 11.8%, $164 million, in 2001 as compared to 2000.  The average price per gallon decreased 7.0% from 84.21 cents in 2000 to 78.32 cents in 2001.  Jet fuel consumption decreased 7.1% principally reflecting decreased flight operations after September 11, 2001 and the fuel efficiency of our younger fleet.  During 2000, we recognized gains of approximately $88 million related to our fuel hedging program, which is reflected in fuel expense.  Losses during 2001 were not material.</p>
<p>	Aircraft rentals increased 7.0%, $59 million, in 2001 compared to 2000, due to the delivery of new aircraft.</p>
<p>	Landing fees and other rentals increased 9.2%, $49 million, in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily due to higher facilities rent and landing fees resulting from increased operations prior to September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>	Maintenance, materials and repairs expense decreased 12.1%, $78 million, during 2001 as compared to 2000 due to the volume and timing of aircraft overhauls as part of our ongoing maintenance program, the mix of aircraft and the grounding of aircraft subsequent to September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>	Depreciation and amortization expense increased 16.2%, $65 million, in 2001 compared to 2000 due principally to the addition of new owned aircraft and related spare parts.</p>
<p>	Reservations and sales expense decreased 2.2%, $10 million, in 2001 as compared to 2000 principally due to lower credit card fees as a result of lower revenue.</p>
<p>	Commissions expense decreased 30.8%, $162 million, in 2001 compared to 2000 due principally to lower revenue and lower rates due to commission caps.</p>
<p>	Passenger servicing expense decreased 4.1%, $15 million, in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily due to improved baggage performance and a decrease in food costs caused by a decrease in passengers.</p>
<p>	Fleet impairment, severance and other special charges in 2001 include costs associated with impairment of various owned aircraft and spare engines ($61 million), furloughs and company-offered leaves ($29 million), a charge for environmental remediation ($17 million) and costs associated with the closure and nonutilization of certain facilities and for certain uncollectible receivables ($17 million).</p>
<p>	We recorded a $417 million Stabilization Act grant in 2001 for direct losses incurred beginning on September 11, 2001 through December 31, 2001 as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  </p>
<p>	Interest expense increased 17.5%, $44 million, in 2001 compared to 2000 due to an increase in long-term debt primarily resulting from the purchase of new aircraft, partially offset by lower rates on variable debt.</p>
<p>	Interest income decreased 48.3%, $42 million, in 2001 compared to 2000 due to lower average balances of cash and lower interest rates.</p>
<p>	Other nonoperating income (expense) in 2001 and 2000, included net losses of $6 million and $44 million, respectively, related to the portion of fuel hedges excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (primarily option time value).  Other nonoperating income (expense) in 2001 included approximately $22 million of special charges related to the impairment of investments in certain affiliates and the uncollectibility of the related notes receivable as a consequence of the events of September 11, 2001.  Other nonoperating income (expense) in 2000 included a $9 million gain related to the sale of a right of first refusal and our remaining investment in America West Holdings Corporation, partially offset by foreign currency losses of $8 million.<b> </b></p>
<p>	In 2000, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $6 million (net of income tax benefit) related to the early repayment of debt.</p>
<p> <u>Comparison of 2000 to 1999</u>.  We recorded consolidated net income of $342 million and $455 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Net income in 2000 included a $6 million after-tax gain on the sale of a right of first refusal and our remaining investment in America West Holdings Corporation and a $6 million extraordinary charge from the early repayment of debt.  Net income in 1999 was significantly impacted by several non-recurring items, including $200 million of after-tax gains on the sale of our interest in Amadeus Global Travel Distribution S.A. and other investments, a $50 million after-tax fleet disposition/ impairment loss related to the early retirement of several DC-10-30's and other items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes ($33 million, net of taxes) related to the write-off of pilot training costs and a change in the method of accounting for the sale of mileage credits to participating partners in our frequent flyer program. </p>
<p>	Passenger revenue increased 14.7%, $1.2 billion, during 2000 as compared to 1999.  The increase was principally due to new transatlantic and Latin American destinations served as well as an improvement in yield and load factor.</p>
<p>	Cargo, mail and other revenue increased 13.0%, $68 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to increased international volumes resulting from new markets.</p>
<p>	Wages, salaries and related costs increased 14.5%, $365 million, during 2000 as compared to 1999, primarily due to a 5.8% increase in average full-time equivalent employees to support increased flying, increased employee incentives and higher wage rates resulting from our decision to increase employee wages to industry standard by the year 2000.</p>
<p>	Aircraft fuel expense increased 84.3%, $637 million, in 2000 as compared to the prior year.  The average price per gallon increased 80.9% from 46.56 cents in 1999 to 84.21 cents in 2000.  In addition, jet fuel consumption decreased 0.2% even with increased flight operations principally reflecting the fuel efficiency of our younger fleet.  During 2000 and 1999, we recognized gains of approximately $88 million and $120 million, respectively, related to our fuel hedging program. </p>
<p>	Aircraft rentals increased 9.5%, $73 million, during 2000 as compared to 1999, due to the addition of newer aircraft.</p>
<p>	Landing fees and other rentals increased 7.0%, $35 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to higher facilities rent and landing fees resulting from increased operations.</p>
<p>	Maintenance, materials and repairs increased 7.1%, $43 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 due to an increase in line maintenance and the volume and timing of engine overhauls as part of our ongoing maintenance program.</p>
<p>	Depreciation and amortization expense increased 11.7%, $42 million, in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to the addition of new aircraft and related spare parts.</p>
<p>	Reservations and sales expense increased 9.9%, $41 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to higher credit card fees resulting from increased sales.</p>
<p>	Commissions expense decreased 8.7%, $50 million, during 2000 as compared to 1999 due to a lower volume of commissionable sales and lower rates resulting from international commission caps.</p>
<p>	Passenger servicing expense increased 2.8%, $10 million, in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in food costs caused by an increase in passengers.</p>
<p>	Other operating expense increased 2.8%, $31 million, in 2000 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increases in outsourced services, travel and other incidental costs, and other miscellaneous expense.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	During 1999, we made the decision to accelerate the retirement of six DC-10-30 aircraft and other items in 1999 and the first half of 2000 and to dispose of related excess inventory. In addition, the market value of certain Boeing 747 aircraft that we no longer operated had declined.  As a result of these items and certain other fleet-related items, we recorded a fleet disposition/impairment loss of $81 million in 1999.</p>
<p>	Interest expense increased 7.7%, $18 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 due to an increase in long-term debt resulting from the purchase of new aircraft, partially offset by interest savings due to the conversion of our 6-3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes into our Class B common stock, in the second quarter of 1999 and the repurchase of our remaining 9-1/2% senior unsecured notes in 2000.</p>
<p>	Interest income increased 22.5%, $16 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 due to higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and due to higher interest rates.</p>
<p>	Other nonoperating income (expense) in 2000 and 1999, both included net losses of $44 million and $15 million, respectively, related to the portion of fuel hedges excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (primarily option time value).  Our other nonoperating income (expense) in 2000 included a $9 million gain related to the sale of a right of first refusal and our remaining investment in America West Holdings Corporation, partially offset by foreign currency losses of $8 million.  Other nonoperating income (expense) in 1999 included a $33 million gain on the sale of a portion of our interest in Equant N.V., partially offset by foreign currency losses of $13 million, losses on equity investments of $7 million and a $4 million loss on the sale of our warrants to purchase common stock of priceline.com, Inc. </p>
<p>	In 2000, an extraordinary charge of $6 million (net of income tax benefit) was recorded related to the early repayment of debt.</p>
<b></b><p>&#160;</p>
<p>Liquidity and Capital Resources</p>
<p>	As of December 31, 2001, we had $1.13 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  Included in that amount is $168 million of cash for transportation taxes, the payment of which was deferred until January pursuant to the Stabilization Act.  Cash flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $567 million, which included $354 million of cash under the Stabilization Act.  Cash flows used in investing activities, primarily capital expenditures and purchase deposits for aircraft, were $654 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Cash flows used in financing activities, primarily for the repurchase of stock and the payment of debt, offset by issuance of long-term debt, were $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.</p>
<p>	Since September 11, 2001, we have not generated positive cash flow from our operations.  Although recently improved traffic has significantly decreased the average daily negative cash flow from operations, our cash flow from operations as of February 20, 2002, remains negative at approximately $2 million per day.  We currently anticipate that we will incur a significant loss for the first quarter of 2002.  However, based on current information and trends, we currently anticipate being profitable in March of 2002 and in the second and third quarters of 2002 due in part to the seasonality of our business.  In addition, we currently expect to incur a loss for the fourth quarter of 2002 and for the full year 2002.  </p>
<p>	We are currently targeting a March 31, 2002 cash balance of approximately $1 billion and a year-end cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion.  As part of our strategy to increase our cash balances to $1.5 billion by year-end, we intend to complete an initial public offering of our ExpressJet Airlines subsidiary.  We originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for a public offering of common stock of ExpressJet's parent last summer, but decided to postpone the offering after September 11, 2001 to allow the financial markets to stabilize and to permit the airline industry to begin its recovery from the events of September 11, 2001.  Our current intention is to continue pursuing our strategy of separating the ownership of Continental and ExpressJet by selling a portion of our interest in ExpressJet to the public for cash.</p>
<p>	Together with our subsidiaries, we anticipate receiving the remaining grant under the Stabilization Act (totaling approximately $63 million in cash) in the first quarter of 2002.  Subsequent to September 11, 2001, we sold shares of common stock and issued 4.5% convertible notes for proceeds totaling $367 million.  See "General Financing" below.  In addition, we will explore the availability of other financing for our liquidity needs.</p>
<p>	We do not currently have any lines of credit, but have unencumbered assets, consisting primarily of spare parts, with a net book value in excess of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2001 which could be pledged in connection with future financings.  Furthermore, the Stabilization Act provides for $10 billion in federal credit instruments (loan guarantees) to U.S. air carriers to guarantee loans from lenders to those air carriers, subject to certain conditions and fees, including limits on compensation of certain of our employees and the potential requirement that the U.S. Government be issued warrants or other equity instruments in connection with such loan guarantees.  If our liquidity needs require us to do so, we may apply for a loan guarantee under this program.</p>
<p>	On several occasions subsequent to September 11, 2001, each of Moody's, Standard and Poor's and Fitch, Ibca, Duff &amp; Phelps downgraded the credit ratings of a number of major airlines, including our credit ratings.  Reductions in our credit ratings have increased the interest rates we pay on approximately $410 million in loans and may increase the cost and reduce the availability of other financing available to us in the future.</p>
<p>	We do not have any debt obligations that would be accelerated as a result of a credit rating downgrade, but under certain debt and contract obligations, one or more further credit rating downgrades would entitle contract counterparties to require us to provide them with up to $41 million in collateral to secure these obligations.</p>
<p>	At December 31, 2001, under the most restrictive provisions of our debt and credit facility agreements, we are required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of $500 million and beginning in the second quarter of 2003, a minimum specified ratio of EBITDAR (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and aircraft rentals) to fixed charges, which consist of interest expense, aircraft rental expense, cash income taxes and cash dividends.  These credit facilities had an outstanding balance of $326 million at December 31, 2001.</p>
<p>	As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately $4.6 billion (including current maturities) of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, $250 million of liquidation amount of Continental-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trust ($243 million, net of unamortized discount) and $1.2 billion of stockholders' equity, a ratio of 3.2 to 1, at December 31, 2001 and 2.0 to 1 at December 31, 2000.</p>
<p>	At December 31, 2001, Continental, including ExpressJet, had 427 aircraft under operating leases (40 of which have been removed from service).  These leases have remaining lease terms ranging from one month to 22-1/2 years.  In addition, Continental has non-aircraft operating leases, principally related to airport and terminal facilities and related equipment.  The obligations for these operating leases are not included in our consolidated balance sheet.  Our total rental expense for aircraft and non-aircraft operating leases, net of sublease rentals, was $903 million and $380 million, respectively, in 2001. </p>
<p>	Most of our assets are encumbered.</p>
<p> <u>General Financing</u>. 	In July 2001, we completed an offering of $200 million of pass-through certificates on owned aircraft at an interest rate of 7.57%.  The proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes.  This obligation has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>	In November 2001, we sold 7,751,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $172 million.  The proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p>	On January 16, 2002 and February 15, 2002, we issued $175 million and $25 million, respectively, of 4.5% convertible notes due February 1, 2007 for net proceeds of $195 million.  The notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion price of $40 per share.  The notes are redeemable at our option on or after February 5, 2005, at specified redemption prices.  The proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p> <u>Aircraft and Facilities Financing</u>.  In January 2001, we borrowed $200 million under a pre-delivery credit facility to be used to finance manufacturer progress payments on new Boeing aircraft.</p>
<p>	During the second quarter of 2001, two offerings of pass-through certificates were completed totaling $901 million at an effective average interest rate of 6.87%.  The proceeds are being used to finance the acquisition cost of 21 new aircraft.  These aircraft are scheduled to be delivered from October 2001 to April 2002. Eight of these aircraft had been placed in service as of December 31, 2001.  At our option, the proceeds can be used to fund the debt portion of a leveraged lease between a third-party lessor and us or to finance the purchase of an owned aircraft by us.  Prior to the delivery of the aircraft, the proceeds are being held in a restricted depositary account that is bankruptcy-protected from our creditors, as well as from us in the event the bank holding the depositary account were to file for bankruptcy.  Additionally, if we choose not to draw on the depositary account, the proceeds will be distributed back to the certificate holders without any penalty to us.  Subsequent to the delivery of the aircraft, the proceeds will be used by third-party lessors to fund the debt portion of leveraged leases or to finance the purchase of owned aircraft by us, at which time either operating lease commitments for leased aircraft will be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements or owned aircraft and the related debt obligations will be reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.  As of December 31, 2001, approximately $655 million of the proceeds remained on deposit.  The restricted cash and related debt are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they are neither our assets nor liabilities.  If any funds remain as deposits at the end of the specified delivery periods, those funds will be distributed back to the certificate holders without payment or penalty to us.</p>
<p>	In August 2001,we borrowed $181 million from a group of banks to finance four new Boeing aircraft that were delivered between July 2001 and December 2001. </p>
<p>	We have entered into agreements with the cities of Houston, Texas and Cleveland, Ohio, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Hawaii Department of Transportation, the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation (in Los Angeles, California), and the Harris County (Houston) Industrial Development Corporation to provide funds for constructing, improving and modifying facilities that have been or will be leased to us and for acquiring related equipment.  In connection therewith, we have unconditionally guaranteed the principal and interest on tax-exempt bonds issued by these entities with a par value in an original principal amount of approximately $1.6 billion (excluding the City of Houston bonds referenced below) and entered into long-term leases with the respective authorities under which rental payments will be sufficient to service the related bonds.  The leases generally have terms ranging from 20 to 30 years.  These leasing arrangements are accounted for as operating leases in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>In August 2001, the City of Houston completed the offering of $324 million aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds to finance the construction of Terminal E at Bush Intercontinental Airport.  In connection therewith, we entered into a long-term lease with the City of Houston requiring that upon completion of construction, with limited exceptions, we will make rental payments sufficient to service the related tax-exempt bonds through their maturity in 2029.  Approximately $27 million of the bond proceeds have been expended as of December 31, 2001.   During the construction period, we maintain certain risks related to our own actions or inactions while managing portions of the construction.  Potential obligations associated with these risks are generally limited based upon certain percentages of construction costs incurred to date.  We have also entered into a binding corporate guaranty with the bond trustee for the repayment of the principal and interest on the bonds that becomes effective upon the occurrence of the completion of construction, our failure to comply with the lease agreement (which is within our control), or our termination of the lease agreement.  Further, we have not assumed any condemnation risk, any casualty event risk (unless caused by us), or risk related to certain overruns (and in the case of cost overruns, our liability for the project would be limited to 89.9% of the capitalized costs) during the construction period.  Accordingly, we are not considered the owner of the project and, therefore, have not capitalized the construction costs or recorded the debt obligation in our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p> <u>Purchase Commitments</u>.  We have substantial commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft.  As of December 31, 2001, we had firm commitments for 87 aircraft from Boeing, with an estimated cost of approximately $3.7 billion, after giving effect to the rescheduling discussed below.  We expect that 20 of these aircraft will be delivered between January 2002 and May 2002.  Thirteen of these 20 aircraft have been pre-financed, and we expect to finance the remaining seven aircraft.  We have agreed with Boeing to reschedule deliveries of the remaining 67 aircraft so that they will be delivered between late 2003 and mid 2008.  We do not have backstop financing from Boeing or any other financing currently in place for the remaining 67 aircraft.  In addition, at December 31, 2001, we had firm commitments to purchase 22 spare engines related to the new Boeing aircraft for approximately $128 million, which will be deliverable through March 2005.  Further financing will be needed to satisfy our capital commitments for our aircraft and aircraft-related expenditures such as engines, spare parts, simulators and related items.  There can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments.  Deliveries of new Boeing aircraft are expected to increase aircraft rental, depreciation and interest costs while generating cost savings in the areas of maintenance, fuel and pilot training.</p>
<p>	As of December 31, 2001, the estimated aggregate cost of ExpressJet's firm commitments for Embraer regional jets is approximately $2.6 billion.  We do not have any obligation to take delivery of any of these firm Embraer aircraft that are not financed by a third party and leased to us.</p>
<p>	We expect our net cash outlays for 2002 capital expenditures, exclusive of fleet plan requirements, will total approximately $200 million, primarily relating to software application and automation infrastructure projects, aircraft modifications, passenger terminal facility improvements and office, maintenance, telecommunications and ground equipment.  Our net capital expenditures during 2001 aggregated $156 million, exclusive of fleet plan requirements.</p>
<p>	We expect to fund our future capital commitments through internally generated funds together with general company financings and aircraft financing transactions.  However, there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments.</p>
<p>	The following table of our material debt, lease, TIDES and aircraft purchase commitments at December 31, 2001, summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on our cash flow in the future periods set forth below (in millions):</p>

<p> <u>Deferred Tax Assets</u>.  We have not paid income taxes, other than alternative minimum taxes, in the last two years.  As of December 31, 2001, we had a net deferred tax liability of $518 million including gross deferred tax assets aggregating $976 million, $532 million related to net operating losses ("NOLs"), and a valuation allowance of $245 million.</p>
<p>	Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 382") imposes limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an "ownership change,"  In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period.  In the event that an ownership change occurred, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax exempt rate (which was 4.82% for January 2002).  Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in assets that we held at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change.  Under current conditions, if an ownership change were to occur, Continental's annual NOL utilization would be limited to approximately $93&#160;million per year other than through the recognition of future built-in gain transactions.</p>
<p>	In November 1998, Northwest Airlines Corporation completed its acquisition of certain equity interests in us previously held by Air Partners, L.P. and its affiliates, together with some of our Class A common stock held by other investors, totaling 8,661,224 shares of the Class A common stock. On January 22, 2001, we repurchased 6,685,279 shares of our Class A common stock from Northwest Airlines Corporation and an affiliate.  In addition, each issued share of our Class A common stock was reclassified into 1.32 shares of Class B common stock in a nontaxable transaction.  We do not believe that these transactions resulted in an ownership change for purposes of Section 382.</p>
<p> <u>Employees</u>.  In 2000, we began implementing a phased plan to bring employee benefits to industry standard levels by 2003.  The plan provides for increases in vacation, paid holidays, increased 401(k) company matching cash contributions and additional past service retirement credit for most senior employees.</p>

<p>	Collective bargaining agreements between us and our mechanics (who are represented by the Teamsters) and between both us and ExpressJet and our respective pilots (who are represented by ALPA) are amendable in January 2002 and October 2002, respectively.  In addition, collective bargaining agreements between CMI and its mechanics and fleet and passenger service employees (represented by the Teamsters) were amendable in March 2001.  Negotiations were deferred due to the economic uncertainty following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  Negotiations have recommenced with the Teamsters in the first quarter of 2002 and are scheduled to commence with ALPA in the summer of 2002.</p>
<p>	Our other employees and those of ExpressJet and CMI are not covered by collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p> <u>Impairment Losses</u>. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we incurred a special charge of $61 million ($39 million after taxes) associated primarily with the impairment of various owned aircraft and spare engines, including all of the DC-10-30, ATR-42, EMB-120 and Boeing 747 and 727 aircraft we owned.</p>
<p>	In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of") ("SFAS 121"), we record impairment losses on owned assets when circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.  We performed evaluations to determine whether future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amount of the aircraft and the related assets.  As a result of the evaluations, we determined that the expected cash flows expected are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, and therefore these aircraft were impaired as defined by SFAS 121.  Consequently, the original cost basis of these aircraft and related items was reduced to reflect their fair market value.  In determining the fair market value of these assets, we considered recent transactions involving sales of similar aircraft and market trends in aircraft dispositions.  Our estimate of cash flows and fair market value might change due to changes in the economic environment in the airline industry.</p>
<p>	As of January 31, 2002, we had 56 jet aircraft and 19 turboprop aircraft out of service from our fleet.  The majority of these aircraft have been temporarily removed from service and we will continue to evaluate whether to return these temporarily grounded aircraft to service, which will primarily depend on demand and yield in the coming months.  It is possible that all or a significant portion of these temporarily grounded aircraft will be permanently removed from service at a later date, which would result in special charges for impairment and lease exit costs. We could suffer additional impairment of operating aircraft and other long-lived assets in the future if the economic environment in which we operate does not continue to improve or further deteriorates due to unforeseen circumstances.  The special charges for all or a significant portion of the temporarily grounded aircraft would, and any additional special charges for impairment of operating aircraft and other long-lived assets could, be material.</p>
<p> <u>Environmental Matters</u>.  In the third quarter of 2001, we recorded a $17 million charge, net of anticipated insurance recoveries, to provide additional reserves for potential environmental remediation costs.  Reserves for estimated losses from environmental remediation are based primarily on third-party environmental studies and estimates as to the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions.  Anticipated insurance proceeds are recorded as a receivable.  Although we believe, based on currently available information, that our reserves for potential environmental remediation costs in excess of anticipated insurance proceeds are adequate, reserves could be adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change.  In addition, certain of our insurers have denied coverage for environmental matters.  We have sued them for coverage, and they have counterclaimed against us.  We cannot currently calculate the increase that might be required in our environmental reserves or predict the outcome of our insurance dispute.  However, we do not expect these items to materially impact our liquidity or our results of operations.</p>
<p> <u>Critical Accounting Policies</u>.  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</p>
<p>	Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.  We believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below.  For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<u><li>Revenue Recognition</li></u>.  We recognize passenger revenue and related commissions, if any, when transportation is provided rather than when a ticket is sold.  The amount of passenger ticket sales and commissions not yet recognized as revenue is reflected as air traffic liability and prepaid commissions, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet.  We perform periodic evaluations of this estimated liability and any adjustments, which can be significant, are included in results of operations for the periods in which the evaluations are completed.  These adjustments relate primarily to differences between our statistical estimation of certain revenue transactions and the related sales price, as well as refunds, exchanges, interline transactions, and other items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price.  These amounts are materially consistent from year to year.</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<u><li>Impairments of Long-Lived Assets</li></u>.  We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items.  Our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions.  The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value.  Our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.</ul>
</ul>
<u><dir>
<dir>
<dir>
</dir></dir></dir></u><p>As a result of the impact on our operations of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we determined that the carrying amounts of our owned DC-10-30, ATR-42, EMB-120 and Boeing 747 and 727 aircraft and related inventories are no longer recoverable based on estimates of future operating cash flows to be generated by these fleets.  As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $61 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.  We estimated the fair value of these aircraft based on industry trends, and, where available, reference to market rates and transactions.  All other long-lived assets, principally our other fleet types and intangible assets, were determined to be recoverable based on our estimates of future cash flows.  Our estimates of future cash flows reflect a return to more historical levels of industry profitability on a longer-term basis.</p>
<p>We provide an allowance for inventory obsolescence over the remaining useful life of the related aircraft for spare parts expected to be on hand on the date the aircraft are retired from service, plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as excess.  These allowances are based on our estimates and industry trends, which are subject to change.  The estimates are more sensitive when we near the end of a fleet life or when we remove entire fleets from service sooner than originally planned.</p>
<p>We regularly review the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our aircraft and spare parts.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<u><li>Frequent Flyer Accounting</li></u>.  We utilize a number of estimates in accounting for our OnePass frequent flyer program which are consistent with industry practices.</ul>
</ul>
<u><dir>
<dir>
<dir>
</dir></dir></dir></u><p>We record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing travel awards which includes the cost of incremental fuel, meals, insurance and miscellaneous supplies and does not include any costs for aircraft ownership, maintenance, labor or overhead allocation.  A change to these cost estimates or the minimum award level could have a significant impact on our liability in the year of change as well as future years.</p>
<p>We defer the portion of amounts received from marketing partners for sale of OnePass miles representing our estimate of the fair value of tickets that are likely to be purchased with mileage credits sold to the marketing partners.  This portion is recognized over the period the mileage credits are expected to be used.  A change to either the time period over which the credits are used or our estimate of the number or fair value of tickets could have a significant impact on our revenue in the year of change as well as future years.</p>
<p>The Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board is currently reviewing the accounting for both multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and volume-based sales incentive offers, but has not yet reached a consensus that would apply to programs such as ours.  The issuance of new accounting standards could have a significant impact on our liability in the year of change as well as future years.</p>
<p> <u>Recently Issued Accounting Standards</u>.  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 - "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142").  SFAS 142 includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them. We will adopt SFAS 142 beginning in the first quarter of 2002 and currently estimate discontinuing the amortization of our goodwill recorded on equity investments and routes, which are indefinite-life intangible assets, which will result in reduced expense of approximately $23 million on an annualized basis.  We will be required to test routes for impairment annually in accordance with SFAS 142, beginning in the first quarter of 2002.  We expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests for goodwill and routes as of January 1, 2002 in the first quarter of 2002.  We do not expect to have a material impairment of our goodwill or routes upon adoption based upon our preliminary assessment of fair values.  </p>
<p>	In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 144 - "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144").  SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121 and the portion of the Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 30 that deals with disposal of a business segment. We do not expect SFAS 144, which is effective in 2002, to have a material effect on our results of operations.</p>
<p> <u>Pensions</u>.  Although 2001 costs associated with our pension plan remained flat, 2002 costs are expected to increase significantly.  This expected increase results primarily from a significant decline in the fair market value of the securities comprising the plan's assets and the participation in the plan by employees who were previously excluded from it.  We are required to meet minimum funding standards for the plan and anticipate that our costs will continue to increase as the number of participants grows.  These increases will be exacerbated, and could be significant, if the value of plan assets remains depressed or drops further and if the overall seniority of participating employees is higher in a given year.  We believe that this may occur as our attrition rates continue to drop.</p>
<p> <u>Other</u>.  Our capacity purchase agreement with ExpressJet provides that we purchase in advance all of its available seat miles for a negotiated price, and we are at risk for reselling the available seat miles at market prices.  We previously announced our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of our interests in ExpressJet.  If we do so, then we would have greater fixed costs, which could result in lower or more volatile earnings or both.  For example, for the year ended December 31, 2001, our pre-tax net loss of approximately $114 million included pre-tax net income for ExpressJet of approximately $80 million.  </p>
<p>	See Note 15 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of related party transactions.</p>
<p>	We anticipate that additional employee stock options will be granted in 2002 to properly incentivize our employees.  The number of options and terms are not yet known.  See Note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p> <u>Outlook</u>.  As discussed above, in light of the events of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath, we currently anticipate that we will incur a significant loss for the first quarter of 2002.  However, based on current information and trends, we currently anticipate being profitable in March of 2002 and in the second and third quarters of 2002 due in part to the seasonality of our business.  In addition, we currently expect to incur a loss for the fourth quarter of 2002 and for the full year 2002.  Although load factors continue to improve, they have done so against significantly reduced capacity.  The reduced capacity, coupled with the fact that many of our costs are fixed in the intermediate to long term, will continue to drive higher unit costs.  Cost per available seat mile for 2002 is expected to increase 5%, holding fuel rate constant, as compared to 2001. This increase is partly attributable to anticipated additional insurance costs in 2002 of approximately $85 million.  Business traffic in most markets continues to be weak, and carriers continue to offer reduced fares to attract passengers, which lowers our passenger revenue and yields and raises our break-even load factor.  We cannot predict when business traffic or yields will increase.</p>
<p>	We believe that our costs are likely to be affected in the future by (i)&#160;higher aircraft ownership costs as new aircraft are delivered, (ii)&#160;higher wages, salaries, benefits and related costs as we reach new union agreements, partially offset by savings realized through employee furloughs, company-offered leaves of absence, retirements and cancellation of open positions, (iii) changes in the costs of materials and services (in particular, the cost of fuel, which can fluctuate significantly in response to global market conditions, and insurance and security costs, which have already increased significantly since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks), (iv) changes in distribution costs and structure, (v)&#160;changes in governmental regulations and taxes affecting air transportation and the costs charged for airport access, including landing fees and<b> </b>new security requirements, (vi)&#160;changes in our fleet and related capacity and (vii)&#160;our continuing efforts to reduce costs throughout our operations, including reduced maintenance costs for new aircraft, reduced distribution expense from using electronic ticketing and the internet for bookings, reduced capital spending, lowering capacity to meet demand, and continuing to remove non-value added costs from the system.  However, the precise impact of these items is not known at this time.</p>
<b></b><p>ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET</p>
<p>  RISK</p>
<p>Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions</p>
<p>	We are subject to certain market risks, including commodity price risk (i.e., aircraft fuel prices), interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price changes related to investments in equity and debt securities.  The adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below.  The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes.  Actual results may differ.  See the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments.</p>
<p> <u>Aircraft Fuel</u>.  Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel.  During 2001 and 2000, aircraft fuel accounted for 13.5% and 15.2%, respectively, of our operating expenses (excluding severance and other special charges and Stabilization Act grant). From time to time we enter into petroleum swap contracts, petroleum call option contracts and/or jet fuel purchase commitments to provide some short-term protection (generally three to six months) against a sharp increase in jet fuel prices. Our fuel hedging strategy may limit our ability to benefit from declines in fuel price.  In February 2002, we purchased out of the money call options to hedge a significant increase in fuel costs for approximately 35% of our projected 2002 fuel requirements for the period March through December.  As of December 31, 2001, we had no fuel hedges in place to protect against price increases as compared to approximately 23% of our projected 2001 fuel requirements hedged at December 31, 2000.  We estimate that a 10% increase in the price per gallon of aircraft fuel would not have a material impact on the fair value of the petroleum call options existing at December 31, 2000.</p>
<p> <u>Foreign Currency</u>.  We are exposed to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenue and expenses.  Our largest exposure comes from the Japanese yen.  However, we attempt to mitigate the effect of certain potential foreign currency losses by entering into forward contracts that effectively enable us to sell Japanese yen expected to be received from yen-denominated net cash flows over the next 12 months at specified exchange rates.  As of December 31, 2001, we had entered into forward contracts to hedge approximately 80% of our 2002 projected yen-denominated net cash flows, as compared to having in place forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our 2001 projected yen-denominated net cash flows at December 31, 2000.  We estimate that at December 31, 2001, a 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the yen would have increased the fair value of the existing forward contracts by $10 million offset by a corresponding loss on the underlying exposure of $12 million resulting in a net $2 million loss as compared to a $15 million increase in the fair value of existing forward contracts offset by a corresponding loss on the underlying exposure of $20 million resulting in a net $5 million loss at December 31, 2000.</p>
<p> <u>Interest Rates</u>.  Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in interest rates (e.g., interest expense on debt and interest income earned on short-term investments).</p>
<p>	We had approximately $1 billion and $754 million of variable-rate debt as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  We have mitigated our exposure on certain variable-rate debt by entering into interest rate cap and swap agreements.  Our interest rate cap, which limited the amount of potential increase in the LIBOR rate component of the floating rate to a maximum of 9% over the term of the contract, expired July 31, 2001.  The interest rate swap outstanding at both December 31, 2001 and 2000 had a notional amount of $176 million. The interest rate swap effectively locks us into paying a fixed rate of interest on a portion of our floating rate debt securities through 2005.  If average interest rates increased by 100 basis points during 2002 as compared to 2001, our projected 2002 interest expense would increase by approximately $8 million, net of interest rate cap and swap.  At December 31, 2000, an interest rate increase of 100 basis points during 2001 as compared to 2000 was projected to increase 2001 interest expense by approximately $5 million, net of interest rate cap and swap.  The interest rate cap does not mitigate this increase in interest expense materially given the current level of such floating rates.</p>
<p>	As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, we estimated the fair value of $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion (carrying value) of our fixed-rate debt to be $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, based upon discounted future cash flows using our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices.  Market risk, estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis points decrease in interest rates, was approximately $115 million and $109 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The fair value of the remaining fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2001 and 2000, (with a carrying value of $526 million and $453 million, respectively), was not practicable to estimate.</p>
<p>	If 2002 average short-term interest rates decreased by 100 basis points over 2001 average rates, our projected interest income from cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments would decrease by approximately $11 million during 2002, compared to an estimated $12 million decrease during 2001 measured at December 31, 2000.</p>
<p> <u>Investments in Equity Securities</u>. We have a 49% equity investment in Compania Panamena de Aviacion, S.A. ("Copa"), a 28% equity investment in Gulfstream International Airlines, Inc. and an 11% equity interest in Orbitz which are also subject to price risk.  However, since a readily determinable market value does not exist for any of Copa, Gulfstream or Orbitz (each is privately held), we are unable to quantify the amount of price risk sensitivity inherent in these investments.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the carrying value of the investment in Copa was $53 million and $48 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the carrying value of the investment in Gulfstream was $0 and $8 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2001, the carrying value of our investment in Orbitz was $12 million.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors and Stockholders</p>
<p>Continental Airlines, Inc.</p>
<p>	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Continental Airlines, Inc. (the "Company") as of December&#160;31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, common stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&#160;31, 2001.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.</p>
<p>	We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<p>	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December&#160;31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&#160;31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.</p>

<p align="CENTER">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</p>
<p align="CENTER"></p>
<p align="CENTER">&#160;</p>
</font></b><p>	Continental Airlines, Inc. is a major United States air carrier engaged in the business of transporting passengers, cargo and mail. We are the fifth largest United States airline (as measured by 2001 revenue passenger miles) and, together with our wholly owned subsidiaries, ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. ("ExpressJet"), and Continental Micronesia, Inc. ("CMI"), each a Delaware corporation, served 215 airports worldwide at January 15, 2002.  As of January 15, 2002, we flew to 123 domestic and 92 international destinations and offered additional connecting service through alliances with domestic and foreign carriers.  We directly served 15 European cities, seven South American cities, Tel Aviv, Hong Kong and Tokyo and are one of the leading airlines providing service to Mexico and Central America, serving more destinations there than any other United States airline.  Through our Guam hub, CMI provides extensive service in the western Pacific, including service to more Japanese cities than any other United States carrier.</p>
<p>	As used in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the terms "Continental", "we", "us", "our" and similar terms refer to Continental Airlines, Inc. and, unless the context indicates otherwise, its subsidiaries.</p>
<b></b><p>NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Principles of Consolidation -</li>
<p>Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Continental and its operating subsidiaries, ExpressJet and CMI.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.</p>
<li>Use of Estimates -</li>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.</p>
<li>Cash and Cash Equivalents -</li>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash and have a maturity of three months or less when purchased. </p>
<li>Short-Term Investments -</li>
<p>We invest in commercial paper with original maturities in excess of 90 days but less than 270 days.  These investments are classified as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates market value, and are classified as held-to-maturity securities.</p>
<li>Spare Parts and Supplies -</li>
<p>Inventories, expendable parts and supplies relating to flight equipment are carried at average acquisition cost and are expensed when incurred in operations.  An allowance for obsolescence is provided over the remaining estimated useful life of the related aircraft, for spare parts expected to be on hand the date the aircraft are retired from service, plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as excess to reduce the carrying costs to the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value.  These allowances are based on management estimates, which are subject to change.</p>
<li>Property and Equipment -</li>
<p>Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated to estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.  The estimated useful lives and residual values for our property and equipment are as follows:</p>

<p>See Note 1 (q) for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.</p>
<li>Air Traffic Liability -</li>
<p>Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided rather than when a ticket is sold.  The amount of passenger ticket sales not yet recognized as revenue is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as air traffic liability.  We perform periodic evaluations of this estimated liability, and any adjustments resulting therefrom, which can be significant, are included in results of operations for the periods in which the evaluations are completed. These adjustments relate primarily to differences between our statistical estimation of certain revenue transactions and the related sales price, as well as refunds, exchanges, interline transactions, and other items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price.</p>
<li>Frequent Flyer Program -</li>
<p>We sponsor a frequent flyer program, "OnePass", and record an estimated liability for the incremental cost associated with providing the related free transportation at the time a free travel award is earned.  The liability is adjusted periodically based on awards earned, awards redeemed and changes in the OnePass program.</p>
<p>	We also sell mileage credits in the OnePass program to participating partners, such as hotels, car rental agencies and credit card companies.  During 1999, as a result of the issuance of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 - "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," we changed the method we use to account for the sale of these mileage credits.  This change, which totaled $27 million, net of tax, was applied retroactively to January 1, 1999 and was accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  Under the new accounting method, revenue from the sale of mileage credits, based on estimates of the fair value of tickets to be redeemed with the mileage sold, is deferred and recognized when transportation is provided.  Previously, the resulting revenue, net of the incremental cost of providing future air travel, was recorded in the period in which the credits were sold. </p>
<p>	The pro forma and actual results for 1999, assuming the accounting change is applied retroactively, is shown below (in millions except per share data):</p>

<li> Passenger Traffic Commissions -</li>
<p>Passenger traffic commissions are recognized as expense when the transportation is provided and the related revenue is recognized.  The amount of passenger traffic commissions not yet recognized as expense is included in Prepayments and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>
<li>Deferred Income Taxes -</li>
<p>Deferred income taxes are provided under the liability method and reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.</p>
<li>Maintenance and Repair Costs -</li>
<p>Maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment, including the overhaul of aircraft components, are charged to operating expense as incurred, except engine overhaul costs covered by power by the hour agreements, which are accrued on the basis of hours flown.</p>
<li>Advertising Costs -</li>
<p>We expense the costs of advertising as incurred.  Advertising expense was $18 million, $60 million and $82 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.</p>
<li>Stock Plans and Awards -</li>
<p>Under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 - "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"), if the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, generally no compensation expense is recognized. Since our stock options have all been granted at fair value, no compensation expense has been recognized under APB 25. We elected to follow APB 25 in accounting for our employee stock options and our stock purchase plans.  We believe APB 25 is preferable to alternative fair value accounting provided for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 - "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), which requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options or purchase rights.</p>
<li>Measurement of Impairment -</li>
<p>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" ("SFAS 121"), we record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets.  The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value if lower than carrying value.</p>
<li>Start-Up Costs -</li>
<p>Statement of Position 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities" ("SOP 98-5"), requires start-up costs to be expensed as incurred.  We adopted SOP 98-5 in the first quarter of 1999.  This statement requires all unamortized start up costs (e.g., pilot training costs related to induction of new aircraft) to be expensed upon adoption, resulting in a $6 million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax, in the first quarter of 1999.</p>
<li>Recently Issued Accounting Standards -</li>
<p>In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 - "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142").  SFAS 142 includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them.  We will adopt SFAS 142 beginning in the first quarter of 2002 and currently estimate discontinuing the amortization of our goodwill recorded on equity investments and routes, which are indefinite-life intangible assets, which will result in reduced expense of approximately $23 million on an annualized basis.  We will be required to test routes for impairment annually in accordance with SFAS 142, beginning in the first quarter of 2002.  We expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests for goodwill and routes as of January 1, 2002 in the first quarter of 2002.  We do not expect to have a material impairment of our goodwill or routes upon adoption based upon our preliminary assessment of fair values.</p>
<p>In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 144 - "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144").  SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121 and the portion of the Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 30 that deals with disposal of a business segment. We do not expect SFAS 144, which is effective in 2002, to have a material effect on our results of operations.</p>

<b></b><p>NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE</p>
<p>	Basic earnings (loss) per common share ("EPS") excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings (loss) of the Company.  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in millions):</p>

<font face="CG Times"><p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p>	At December 31, 2001, Continental, including ExpressJet, had 427 and 11 aircraft (of which 40 operating leased aircraft and five capital leased aircraft have been removed from service) under operating and capital leases, respectively.  These leases have remaining lease terms ranging from one month to 22-1/2 years.</p>
<p>	Our total rental expense for aircraft operating leases, net of sublease rentals, was $903 million, $844 million and $771 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Total rental expense for non-aircraft operating leases, net of sublease rentals, was $380 million, $353 million and $328 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.</p>
<b>
</b><p>NOTE 5 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>	As part of our risk management program, we use or have used a variety of financial instruments, including petroleum call options, petroleum swap contracts, jet fuel purchase commitments, foreign currency average rate options, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate cap and swap agreements.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.</p>
<u></u><p>Notional Amounts and Credit Exposure of Derivatives</p>
<p>	The notional amounts of derivative financial instruments summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged between parties and, therefore, are not a measure of our exposure resulting from our use of derivatives.  The amounts exchanged are calculated based upon the notional amounts as well as other terms of the instruments, which relate to interest rates, exchange rates or other indices.</p>
<u></u><p>Fuel Price Risk Management</p>
<b>
</b><p>	As of December 31, 2001, we had no fuel hedges in place to protect against fuel price increases, we have from time to time entered into petroleum swap contracts, petroleum call option contracts and/or jet fuel purchase commitments to provide some short-term protection (generally three to six months) against a sharp increase in jet fuel prices.  Should we enter into any such arrangements in the future, our fuel hedging strategy may limit our ability to benefit from declines in fuel price.</p>
<p>	We account for the call options and swap contracts as cash flow hedges.  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 - "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), such financial instruments are recorded at fair value with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes and hedge ineffectiveness, and recognized as a component of fuel expense when the underlying fuel being hedged is used.  The ineffective portion of these call options and swap agreements is determined based on the correlation between West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil prices and jet fuel prices.  Hedge ineffectiveness is included in other nonoperating income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and was not material for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.  For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, we recognized approximately $6 million, $44 million and $15 million, respectively, of net losses related to the portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (primarily time value). These losses are also included in nonoperating income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.</p>
<p>	We had petroleum call options outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $329 million at December 31, 2000.  The fair value of these hedges was not material.  There were no outstanding fuel hedges at December 31, 2001.</p>
<u></u><p>Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management</p>
<p>	We use a combination of foreign currency average rate options and forward contracts to hedge against the currency risk associated with our forecasted Japanese yen-denominated net cash flows for the following nine to twelve months.  The average rate options and forward contracts have only nominal intrinsic value at the date contracted. </p>
<p>	We account for these instruments as cash flow hedges.  In accordance with SFAS 133, such financial instruments are recorded at fair value with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes and hedge ineffectiveness, and recognized as a component of revenue when the underlying net cash flows are realized. We measure hedge effectiveness of average rate options and forward contracts based on the forward price of the underlying currency.  Hedge ineffectiveness was not material during 2001, 2000 or 1999.</p>
<p>	At December 31, 2001, we had yen forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $131 million and an unrealized gain of $14 million.  The notional amount of our yen forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2000 was $188 million with an unrealized gain of $22 million.  Unrealized gains (losses) are recorded in other current assets (liabilities) with the offset to other accumulated comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes and hedge ineffectiveness.  The unrealized gain at December 31, 2001 will be recognized in earnings within the next twelve months.</p>
<u></u><p>Interest Rate Risk Management</p>
<p>	We entered into interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of potential interest rate increases on floating rate debt.  The interest rate cap had a notional amount of $84 million as of December 31, 2000, and was effective through July 31, 2001.  The interest rate swap had a notional amount of $176 million at both December 31, 2001 and 2000.  We account for the interest rate cap and swap as cash flow hedges whereby the fair value of the interest rate cap and swap is reflected in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset, net of income taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness (which is not material), recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  The fair value of the interest rate swap was a negative $9 million at December 31, 2001 and the fair value of the interest rate cap and swap were not material as of December 31, 2000. Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the related hedge.  Such amounts were not material during 2001, 2000 or 1999.</p>
<u></u><p>Other Financial Instruments</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Cash equivalents -</li>
<p>Cash equivalents are carried at cost and consist primarily of commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less and approximate fair value due to their short maturity.</p>
<li>Short-term Investments -</li>
<p>Short-term investments consist primarily of commercial paper with original maturities in excess of 90 days but less than 270 days and approximate fair value due to their short maturity.  We classify these investments as held-to-maturity securities.</p>
<li>Investment in Equity Securities -</li>
<p>We have a 49% interest in Compania Panamena de Aviacion, S.A. ("Copa") for $53 million.  The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the excess of the amount at which the investment is carried and the amount of underlying equity in the net assets was $40 million and $41 million, respectively.  This difference is treated as goodwill and is being amortized over 40 years.  Effective January 1, 2002, the amortization of this goodwill will be discontinued in accordance with SFAS 142.</p>
<p>On October 20, 1999, we sold our interest in Amadeus Global Travel Distribution, S.A. for $409 million, including a special dividend.  The sale, which occurred as part of Amadeus's initial public offering, resulted in a gain of approximately $297 million.</p>
<p>In December 1999, we acquired a 28% interest in Gulfstream International Airlines, Inc. ("Gulfstream").  The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the carrying value of the investment in Gulfstream was $0 and $8 million, respectively.  We have also guaranteed approximately $17 million of debt for Gulfstream as of December 31, 2001.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2001, we had an 11% equity interest in Orbitz, a comprehensive travel planning website. We account for our investment in Orbitz under the equity method of accounting.  At December 31, 2001, the carrying value of our investment in Orbitz was $12 million.</p>
<li>Debt -</li></ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>The fair value of our debt with a carrying value of $3.6 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, estimated based on the discounted amount of future cash flows using our current incremental rate of borrowing for a similar liability or market prices, approximated $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>The fair value of the remaining debt (with a carrying value of $626 million and $567 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively), was not practicable to estimate.</p>

<ol start="5" type="a">
<li>Preferred Securities of Trust -</li>
<p>As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the fair value of our 5,000,000 6% Convertible Preferred Securities, Term Income Deferrable Equity Securities ("TIDES"), with a carrying value of $243 million, estimated based on market quotes, approximated $142 million and $259 million, respectively.</p>
<li>Warrants -</li>
<p>We are the holder of warrants in a number of start-up e-commerce companies focused on various segments of the travel distribution network.  The warrants are recorded at fair value with the offset recorded to non-operating income.  The fair value of these warrants was not material at December 31, 2001 or 2000.</p>

<dir>
<dir>
<p>We have a compensation plan for all officers that provides a cash benefit that is indexed to the appreciation in fair value of a number of underlying equity securities of </p>
<p>e-commerce businesses related to the travel industry (including both Hotwire and Orbitz).  The benefit formula meets the definition of a derivative, and is accordingly accounted for at fair value, with the offset recorded to non-operating expense.  The fair value of the underlying equity securities derivative was not material at December 31, 2001 or 2000.</p>

<u></u><p>Credit Exposure of Financial Instruments</p>
<p>	We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by issuers of financial instruments.  To manage credit risks, we select issuers based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to a single issuer under defined Company guidelines, and monitor the market position with each counterparty.</p>
<b></b><p>NOTE 6 - PREFERRED SECURITIES OF TRUST</p>
<p>	In November 2000, Continental Airlines Finance Trust II, a Delaware statutory business trust (the "Trust") of which we own all the common trust securities, completed a private placement of 5,000,000 6% Convertible Preferred Securities, Term Income Deferrable Equity Securities or TIDES.  The TIDES have a liquidation value of $50 per preferred security and are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of Class B common stock at a conversion rate of $60 per share of Class B common stock (equivalent to approximately 0.8333 share of Class B common stock for each preferred security).  Distributions on the preferred securities are payable by the Trust at an annual rate of 6% of the liquidation value of $50 per preferred security and are included in Distributions on Preferred Securities of Trust in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The proceeds of the private placement, which totaled $242 million (net of $8 million of underwriting commissions and expense) are included in Continental-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding Solely Convertible Subordinated Debentures in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>
<p>	The sole assets of the trust are 6% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures ("Convertible Subordinated Debentures") with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million issued by us and which mature on November 15, 2030.  The Convertible Subordinated Debentures are redeemable by us, in whole or in part, on or after November 20, 2003 at designated redemption prices.  If we redeem the Convertible Subordinated Debentures, the Trust must redeem the TIDES on a pro rata basis having an aggregate liquidation value equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures redeemed.  Otherwise, the TIDES will be redeemed upon maturity of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures, unless previously converted.</p>
<p>	Taking into consideration our obligations under (i) the Preferred Securities Guarantee relating to the TIDES, (ii) the Indenture relating to the Convertible Subordinated Debentures to pay all debt and obligations and all costs and expenses of the Trust (other than U.S. withholding taxes) and (iii) the Indenture, the Declaration relating to the TIDES and the Convertible Subordinated Debentures, we have fully and unconditionally guaranteed payment of (i) the distributions on the TIDES, (ii) the amount payable upon redemption of the TIDES, and (iii) the liquidation amount of the TIDES.</p>
<p>	The Convertible Subordinated Debentures and related income statement effects are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<b></b><p>NOTE 7 - REDEEMABLE COMMON, PREFERRED, COMMON AND TREASURY STOCK</p>
<b></b><p>Redeemable Common Stock</p>

<b></b><p>Common Stock</p>
<p>	We currently have one class of common stock issued and outstanding, Class B common stock. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to one vote per share.  </p>
<b></b><p>Treasury Stock</p>
<p>	We began a stock repurchase program in 1998 under which we repurchased a total of 28.2 million shares of Class B common stock for a total of approximately $1.2 billion through December 31, 2001.  Approximately $216 million remained available in the program as of December 31, 2001.  In addition to the current balance, the program permits (i) one-half of future net income (excluding special gains and charges), (ii) all the proceeds from the sale of non-strategic assets and (iii) the amount of cash proceeds we receive for the purchase of common stock by employees and other participants under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans to be added to the program.  This program was suspended during 2001.</p>
<p> </p>
<b></b><p>Stockholder Rights Plan</p>
<p>	Effective November 20, 1998, we adopted a stockholder rights plan (the "Rights Plan") in connection with the disposition by Air Partners, L.P. of its interest in Continental to Northwest Airlines Corporation.  Effective January 22, 2001, we amended the Rights Plan to take into account, among other things, the effects of the recapitalization and to eliminate the status of the Northwest parties as exempt persons that would not trigger the provisions of the Rights Plan.</p>
<p>	The rights become exercisable upon the earlier of (i) the tenth day following a public announcement or public disclosure of facts indicating that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% (25%, or more in some cases, in the case of an Institutional Investor) or more of the total number of votes entitled to be cast generally by holders of our common stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class (such person or group being an "Acquiring Person"), or (ii) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of our board of directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any person becoming an Acquiring Person.  Certain persons and entities related to us or Air Partners are exempt from the definition of "Acquiring Person."</p>
<p>	The rights will expire on November 20, 2008 unless extended or unless the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by us.</p>
<p>	Subject to certain adjustments, if any person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a right, other than rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and its affiliates and associates (which rights will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof, that number of shares of Class B common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price ($200, subject to adjustment) of the right.</p>
<p>	If at any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, (i) we merge into any other person, (ii) any person merges into us and all of our outstanding common stock does not remain outstanding after such merger, or (iii) we sell 50% or more of our consolidated assets or earning power, each holder of a right (other than the Acquiring Person and its affiliates and associates) will have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring corporation (including us as successor thereto or as the surviving corporation) which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the right.</p>
<p>	At any time after any person becomes an Acquiring Person, and prior to the acquisition by any person or group of a majority of our voting power, our board of directors may exchange the rights (other than rights owned by such Acquiring Person, which will have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of Class B common stock per right (subject to adjustment).</p>
<p>	At any time prior to any person becoming an Acquiring Person, our board of directors may redeem the rights at a price of $.001 per right.  The Rights Plan may be amended by our board of directors without the consent of the holders of the rights, except that from and after the time that any person becomes an Acquiring Person no such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the rights (other than the Acquiring Person and its affiliates and associates).  Until a right is exercised, its holder, as such, will have no rights as one of our stockholders, including the right to vote or to receive dividends. </p>

<p>	The Incentive Plan 2000 provides for awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock, performance awards and incentive awards. Each of the other plans permits awards of either stock options or restricted stock.  Each plan permits awards to be made to the non-employee directors of the company or the employees of the company or its subsidiaries.  Stock issued under the plans may be originally issued shares, treasury shares or a combination thereof.  The total shares remaining for award under the plans as of December 31, 2001 was 7.2 million, although no new awards can be made under the 1994 Incentive Equity Plan.</p>
<p>	Stock options are awarded under the plans with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, and typically vest over a three to four-year period.  Employee stock options generally have a five-year term, while outside director stock options have ten-year terms.</p>
<p>	Under the terms of the Plans, a change in control would result in all outstanding options under these plans becoming exercisable in full and restrictions on restricted shares being terminated.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>	The table below summarizes stock option transactions pursuant to our 2000 Incentive Plan and the Plans (share data in thousands).  The vast majority of outstanding options were voluntarily surrendered to us in October 2001.</p>

<b></b><p>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</p>
<p>	All of our employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase program under which they may purchase shares of Class B common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the option period or the last day of the option period.  During 2001 and 2000, 710,394 and 481,950 shares, respectively, of Class B common stock were issued at prices ranging from $13.40 to $38.30 in 2001 and $27.73 to $38.30 in 2000.  During 1999, 526,729 shares of Class B common stock were issued at prices ranging from $27.84 to $49.41.</p>
<b></b><p>Pro Forma SFAS 123 Results</p>
<p>	Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options and purchase rights under the fair value method of SFAS 123.  The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively:  risk-free interest rates of 4.8%, 6.5% and 4.9%, dividend yields of 0%; volatility factors of the expected market price of our Class B common stock of 46% for 2001, 47% for 2000 and 43% for 1999, and a weighted-average expected life of the option of 4.9 years, 3.6 years and 3.1 years.  The weighted average grant date fair value of the stock options granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $22.63, $17.37 and $11.13 per option, respectively.</p>
<p>	The fair value of the purchase rights under the stock purchase plans was also estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively:  risk free interest rates of 3.3%, 5.9% and 4.7%; dividend yields of 0%, expected volatility of 46% for 2001, 47% for 2000 and 43% for 1999; and an expected life of .25 years for each of 2001, 2000 and 1999.  The weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $5.12, $10.18 and $7.72, respectively.</p>
<p>	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.  Because our employee stock options and purchase rights have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in our opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options and purchase rights.</p>
<p>	Assuming that we had accounted for our employee stock options and purchase rights using the fair value method and amortized the resulting amount to expense over the options' vesting periods, net loss would have been increased by $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and net income would have been decreased by $20 million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Basic net loss per share would have increased by 11 cents for the year ended December 31, 2001 and basic EPS would have decreased by 33 cents and 35 cents for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Diluted net loss per share would have increased by 11 cents for the year ended December 31, 2001 and diluted EPS would have decreased by 32 cents and 33 cents for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  </p>

<p>	We have noncontributory defined benefit pension and defined contribution (including 401(k) savings) plans.  Substantially all of our domestic employees are covered by one or more of these plans.  The benefits under the active defined benefit pension plan are based on years of service and an employee's final average compensation.  For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, total expense for the defined contribution plan was $34 million, $17 million and $14 million, respectively.</p>

<p>	The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion and $956 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2001, and $39 million, $26 million and $0, respectively, as of December 31, 2000.</p>
<p>	During 1999, we amended our benefit plan as a result of changes in benefits pursuant to new collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>	Plan assets consist primarily of equity securities, long-term debt securities and short-term investments.</p>
<p>	Our policy is to fund the noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Internal Revenue Service requirements as modified, to the extent applicable, by agreements with the IRS.</p>
<p>	Our defined contribution 401(k) employee savings plan covers substantially all domestic employees.  Effective January 1, 2001, we amended the plan to increase the employer-matching contribution rate, which is made in cash.</p>
<p>	We also have a profit sharing program under which an award pool consisting of 15% of our annual pre-tax earnings, subject to certain adjustments, is distributed each year to substantially all employees (other than employees whose collective bargaining agreement provides otherwise or who otherwise receive profit sharing payments as required by local law) on a pro rata basis according to base salary.  The profit sharing expense included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $66 million and $62 million, respectively.</p>

<p>	At December 31, 2001, we had estimated tax net operating losses ("NOLs") of $1.5 billion for federal income tax purposes that will expire through 2022 and federal investment tax credit carryforwards of $27 million that will expire in 2002.  Due to our ownership change on April 27, 1993, the ultimate utilization of our NOLs and investment tax credits may be limited.  Reflecting this limitation, we had a valuation allowance of $245 million and $263 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The change in valuation allowance during 2001 relates to previously reserved credits that expired in 2001 resulting in the removal of both the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance.</p>
<p>	We have consummated several transactions that resulted in the recognition of NOLs of our predecessor.  To the extent we were to determine in the future that additional NOLs of  our predecessor could be recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, such benefit would reduce the value ascribed to routes and airport operating rights.</p>
<b>
</b><p>NOTE 12 - FLEET IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, SEVERANCE AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES</p>
<p>	In 2001, we recorded a $146 million charge for fleet impairment losses, severance and other special charges including a fleet impairment loss of approximately $61 million associated primarily with the impairment of various owned aircraft and spare engines.  The aircraft in the impairment include all of our owned DC-10-30, ATR-42, EMB-120 and Boeing 747 and 727 aircraft.</p>
<p>	As a result of the evaluations that were performed, we determined that the expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, and therefore these aircraft are impaired as defined by SFAS 121.  Consequently, the original cost basis of these aircraft and related items was reduced to reflect their estimated fair market value.  In determining the fair market value of these assets, we considered recent transactions involving sales of similar aircraft and market trends in aircraft dispositions.</p>
<p>	We also recorded a special charge in 2001 totaling $63 million for the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<ol type="a">
<li>As a result of the reduced operations and company-wide furloughs of approximately 8,000 employees resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, some employees accepted company-offered one-year leaves of absence, which included continued medical coverage and retirement plan credit.  Costs associated with these leaves of absence, together with severance for furloughed employees, resulted in our recording a charge of $29 million.</li>
<li>As a result of the reduced operations and issues arising out of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath, we accrued $17 million for additional costs associated with the closure and nonutilization of certain facilities and for some of our uncollectible receivables.</li>
<li>We accrued $17 million of additional costs for remediation of environmental contamination at various airport locations.  Amounts recorded are based on preliminary third-party environmental studies and our current assessments of the ultimate outcome and the likelihood of receipt of insurance proceeds covering such costs, and accordingly, could increase or decrease as these assessments change.</li></ol>
</ol>
<p>	These charges are recorded in Fleet impairment losses, severance and other special charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.</p>
<p>	Also, in September 2001, and as a consequence of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we recorded a special non-operating charge of $22 million related to the impairment of investments in some of our affiliates and the uncollectibility of related notes receivable.  This charge is included in Non-operating Income (Expense) - Other, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.</p>
<p>	In 1999, we made the decision to accelerate the retirement of six DC-10-30 aircraft and other items in 1999 and the first half of 2000 and to dispose of related excess inventory. In addition, the market value of certain Boeing 747 aircraft that we no longer operated had declined.  As a result of these items and certain other fleet-related items, we recorded a fleet disposition/impairment loss of $81 million in 1999.  Approximately $52 million of the $81 million charge related to the impairment of owned or capital leased aircraft and related inventory held for disposal with a carrying amount of $77 million.  The remaining $29 million of the charge related primarily to costs expected to be incurred related to the return of leased aircraft.</p>
<p>	Significant activity related to these accruals during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were limited to cash payments incurred.</p>
<b></b><p>NOTE 13 - STABILIZATION ACT GRANT</p>
<p>	On September 21, 2001, Congress passed, and the President subsequently signed into law, the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the "Stabilization Act"), which provides, among other matters, for $5 billion in payments to compensate U.S. air carriers for losses incurred by the air carriers as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  We recognized a $417 million grant under the Stabilization Act for the year ended December 31, 2001, approximately $354 million of which we received in cash. We expect to receive the remaining cash in the first quarter of 2002.  The grant is for the direct losses incurred beginning on September 11, 2001, resulting from the FAA grounding, and for incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001 as a direct result of the attacks.  The grant is included in Stabilization Act grant in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.</p>
<b>
</b><p>NOTE 14 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</p>
<p> <u>Purchase Commitments</u>.  We have substantial commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft.  As of December 31, 2001, we had firm commitments for 87 aircraft from Boeing, with an estimated cost of approximately $3.7 billion, after giving effect to the rescheduling discussed below.  We expect that 20 of these aircraft will be delivered between January 2002 and May 2002.  Thirteen of these 20 aircraft have been pre-financed, and we expect to finance the remaining seven aircraft.  We have agreed with Boeing to reschedule deliveries of the remaining 67 aircraft so that they will be delivered between late 2003 and mid 2008. We do not have backstop financing from Boeing or any other financing currently in place for the remaining 67 aircraft.  In addition, at December 31, 2001, we had firm commitments to purchase 22 spare engines related to the new Boeing aircraft for approximately $128 million, which will be deliverable through March 2005. Further financing will be needed to satisfy our capital commitments for our aircraft and aircraft-related expenditures such as engines, spare parts, simulators and related items.  There can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments.  Deliveries of new Boeing aircraft are expected to increase aircraft rental, depreciation and interest costs while generating cost savings in the areas of maintenance, fuel and pilot training.</p>
<p>	As of December 31, 2001, our ExpressJet Airlines subsidiary had firm commitments for 137 Embraer regional jets with options for an additional 100 Embraer regional jets exercisable through 2007.  ExpressJet anticipates taking delivery of 51 regional jets in 2002.  The estimated cost of our firm commitments for Embraer regional jets is approximately $2.6 billion.  We will not have any obligation to take any of these firm Embraer aircraft that are not financed by a third party and leased to us.</p>
<u></u><p>Financings and Guarantees.  In August 2001, the City of Houston completed the offering of $324 million aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds to finance the construction of Terminal E at Bush Intercontinental Airport.  In connection therewith, we entered into a long-term lease with the City of Houston requiring that upon completion of construction, with limited exceptions, we will make rental payments sufficient to service the related tax-exempt bonds through their maturity in 2029. Approximately $27 million of the bond proceeds have been expended as of December 31, 2001.  During the construction period, we maintain certain risks related to our own actions or inactions while managing portions of the construction.  Potential obligations associated with these risks are generally limited based upon certain percentages of construction costs incurred to date.  We have also entered into a binding corporate guaranty with the bond trustee for the repayment of the principal and interest on the bonds that becomes effective upon the occurrence of the completion of construction, our failure to comply with the lease agreement (which is within our control), or our termination of the lease agreement.   Further, we have not assumed any condemnation risk, any casualty event risk (unless caused by us), or risk related to certain overruns (and in the case of cost overruns, our liability for the project would be limited to 89.9% of the capitalized costs) during the construction period.  Accordingly, we are not considered the owner of the project and, therefore, have not capitalized the construction costs or recorded the debt obligation in our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>	Proceeds from pass-through certificates can be used to fund the debt portion of a leveraged lease between a third-party lessor and us or to finance the purchase of an owned aircraft by us.  Prior to the delivery of the aircraft, the proceeds are being held in a restricted depositary account that is bankruptcy-protected from our creditors, as well as from us in the event the bank holding the depositary account were to file for bankruptcy.  Additionally, if we choose not to draw on the depositary account, the proceeds will be distributed back to the certificate holders without any penalty to us. Subsequent to the delivery of the aircraft, the proceeds will be used by third-party lessors to fund the debt portion of leveraged leases or to finance the purchase of owned aircraft by us, at which time either operating lease commitments for leased aircraft will be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements or owned aircraft and the related debt obligations will be reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.  As of December 31, 2001, approximately $655 million of the proceeds remained on deposit.  The restricted cash and related debt are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they are neither our assets nor liabilities.  If any funds remain as deposits at the end of the specified delivery periods, those funds will be distributed back to the certificate holders without payment or penalty to us.</p>
<p>	We are the guarantor of approximately $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon.  These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from our rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies.</p>
<p>	We remain contingently liable until December 1, 2015, for US Airways, Inc.'s obligations under a lease agreement between US Airways and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey related to the East End Terminal at LaGuardia airport.  These obligations include the payment of ground rentals to the Port Authority and the payment of principal and interest on $189 million par value special facilities revenue bonds issued by the Port Authority, which amount is included in our total $1.6 billion guaranteed obligations described above.  If US Airways defaulted on these obligations, we could be required to cure the default, at which time we would have the right to occupy the terminal.</p>
<p>	We have cargo facilities at Los Angeles International Airport, which we sublease to another carrier.  If the carrier failed to comply with its obligations under the sublease, we would be required to perform those obligations.  We have guaranteed the repayment of principal and interest on $24 million par value bonds related to this facility, which amount is included in our total $1.6 billion guaranteed obligations described above.</p>
<p> <u>Employees</u>.  Approximately 44% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements between us and our mechanics and between both us and ExpressJet and our respective pilots are amendable in January 2002 and October 2002, respectively.  In addition, collective bargaining agreements between CMI and its mechanics and fleet and passenger service employees were amendable in March 2001.  Negotiations were deferred due to the economic uncertainty following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  Negotiations have recommenced with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in the first quarter of 2002 and are scheduled to commence with the Air Line Pilots Association in the summer of 2002.  We continue to believe that mutually acceptable agreements can be reached with such employees, although the ultimate outcome of the negotiations is unknown at this time.</p>
<p> <u>Other</u>.  We expect that our net cash outlays for 2002 capital expenditures, exclusive of fleet plan requirements, will total approximately $200 million, primarily relating to software application and automation infrastructure projects, aircraft modifications, passenger terminal facility improvements and office, maintenance, telecommunications and ground equipment.</p>
<p>	As of December 31, 2001, we had 59 jet aircraft and 18 turboprop aircraft out of service from our fleet.  The majority of these aircraft have been temporarily removed from service and we will continue to evaluate whether to return these temporarily grounded aircraft to service, which will primarily depend on demand and yield in the coming months.  It is possible that all or a significant portion of these temporarily grounded aircraft will be permanently removed from service at a later date, which would result in special charges for impairment and lease exit costs. We could suffer additional impairment of operating aircraft and other long-lived assets in the future if the economic environment in which we operate does not continue to improve or further deteriorates due to unforeseen circumstances.  The special charges for all or a significant portion of the temporarily grounded aircraft would, and any additional special charges for impairment of operating aircraft and other long-lived assets could, be material.</p>
<b>
</b><p> <u>Environmental Matters</u>.  In the third quarter of 2001, we recorded a $17 million charge, net of anticipated insurance recoveries, to provide additional reserves for potential environmental remediation costs.  Reserves for estimated losses from environmental remediation are based primarily on third-party environmental studies and estimates as to the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions.  Anticipated insurance proceeds are recorded as a receivable.  Although we believe, based on currently available information, that our reserves for potential environmental remediation costs in excess of anticipated insurance proceeds are adequate, reserves could be adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change.  In addition, certain of our insurers have denied coverage for environmental matters.  We have sued them for coverage, and they have counterclaimed against us.  We cannot currently calculate the increase that might be required in our environmental reserves or predict the outcome of our insurance dispute.  However, we do not expect these items to materially impact our liquidity or our results of operations.</p>
<p> <u>Legal Proceedings</u>.  On July 25, 2000, a Concorde aircraft operated by Air France crashed shortly after takeoff from France's Charles de Gaulle airport, killing 114 people, most of whom were tourists on board the chartered aircraft, which was also destroyed.  The final investigative report of the French authorities issued January 15, 2002, suggests that one of the aircraft's tires burst after running over a small piece of metal believed by investigators to have come from one of our DC-10 aircraft that had taken off on the same runway a short time before the Concorde and that portions of the resulting debris struck the underside of a wing of the aircraft which caused the rupture of a fuel tank, leading to a fire and the crash.  </p>
<p>	Several lawsuits involving us are pending in connection with the accident.  These cases are in preliminary stages.  Although the outcome of these suits or any future litigation cannot be known at this time, our costs to defend these matters and, we believe, any potential liability exposure are covered by insurance.  Consequently, we do not expect this litigation or any additional suits that may arise from the accident to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.</p>
<p>	We and/or certain of our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits, including suits relating to certain environmental claims, and proceedings arising in the normal course of business.  While the outcome of these lawsuits and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, it is our opinion, after consulting with counsel, that the ultimate disposition of such suits will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.</p>
<b></b><p>NOTE 15 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS</p>
<p>	The following is a summary of significant related party transactions that occurred during 2001, 2000 and 1999, other than those discussed elsewhere in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<p>	In December 2000, we sold our remaining investment in America West Holdings Corporation, a company in which David Bonderman, one of our directors, holds a significant interest.  We and America West Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of America West Holdings Corporation entered into a series of agreements during 1994 related to code-sharing and ground handling that have created substantial benefits for both airlines. The services provided are considered normal to the daily operations of both airlines.  As a result of these agreements, we paid America West $25 million, $28 million and $25 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and America West paid Continental $30 million, $33 million and $31 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.</p>
<p>	In November 2000, we entered into a number of agreements with Northwest Airlines Corporation and some of its affiliates under which we would repurchase most of our Class A common stock owned by Northwest.  In November 1998, we began implementing a long-term global alliance with Northwest Airlines, Inc. involving extensive code-sharing, frequent flyer reciprocity and other cooperative activities.  The services provided are considered normal to the daily operations of both airlines.  As a result of these activities, we paid Northwest $486 million (including $450 million related to the repurchase of our Class A shares), $10 million and $7 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and Northwest paid us $19 million, $14 million and $9 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.</p>
<p>	Also in November 2000, we entered into an agreement to pay 1992 Air, Inc. $10 million in cash for its sale to us of its right of first offer to purchase the shares of Class A common stock that we purchased from Northwest.  This amount was paid in January 2001 in connection with our purchase of those shares.  1992 Air, Inc. is an affiliate of David Bonderman, one of our directors.</p>
<p>	During December 1999, we entered into an equipment sales agreement with Copa for $8 million.  The resulting note receivable is payable in quarterly installments through October 2002.  The services provided are considered normal to the daily operations of both airlines.  Copa paid us $0, $8 million and $4 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, and we paid Copa approximately $1 million in each of 2001, 2000 and 1999.</p>
<p>	In connection with our investment in Gulfstream, we purchased from Gulfstream, a ten-year $10 million convertible note, payable in quarterly installments of principal and interest totaling $0.4 million.  We also purchased a short-term $3 million secured note, with interest paid quarterly.  During 2001, 2000 and 1999, we paid Gulfstream $3 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively, and Gulfstream paid us $2 million, $16 million and $13 million, respectively, for services considered normal to the daily operations of both airlines.</p>
<p>	Also during December 1999, under a sale and leaseback agreement with Gulfstream, ExpressJet sold 25 Beech 1900-D aircraft to Gulfstream in exchange for Gulfstream's assumption of $81 million in debt.  In addition, we have guaranteed approximately $17 million of debt for Gulfstream as of December 31, 2001.</p>
<p>	In 2000, we entered into a marketing agreement with CIMO, Inc. (d/b/a Hotwire), a web-based travel services company.  Two of our directors, David Bonderman and William Price, indirectly control significant equity interests in Hotwire.  As of December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 9% of the equity interest in Hotwire.  We sold Hotwire approximately $19 million and $1 million of air travel tickets during 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Other airlines also own equity interests in Hotwire, and also sell air travel tickets to Hotwire.  The distribution services provided by Hotwire are considered normal to the daily operations of both Hotwire and us.  </p>
<p>	In 2001, Orbitz, a comprehensive travel planning website, in which we have an 11% equity interest, became available to customers.  We paid Orbitz approximately $2 million for services during 2001 and consumers booked approximately $55 million of air travel on us via Orbitz.  Other airlines also own equity interests in Orbitz and distribute air travel tickets through Orbitz.  The distribution services provided by Orbitz are considered normal to the daily operations of both Orbitz and us.</p>
