</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental Airlines, Inc. (the "Company" or "Continental") is a major United States air carrier engaged in the business of transporting passengers, cargo and mail.  Continental is the fifth largest United States airline (as
measured by 2000 revenue passenger miles) and, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Continental Express, Inc. ("Express") and Continental Micronesia, Inc. ("CMI"), each a Delaware corporation, served 230 airports worldwide at January 19, 2001.  As
of January 19, 2001, Continental flew to 136 domestic and 94 international destinations and offered additional connecting service through alliances with domestic and foreign carriers.  Continental directly served 16 European cities, seven South American
cities, Tel Aviv and Tokyo and is one of the leading airlines providing service to Mexico and Central America, serving more destinations there than any other United States airline.  Through its Guam hub, CMI provides extensive service in the western
Pacific, including service to more Japanese cities than any other United States carrier.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As used in this Form&nbsp;10-K, the terms "Continental" and "Company" refer to Continental Airlines, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.  This Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements.  In
connection therewith, please see the cautionary statements contained in Item 1.  "Business - Risk Factors Relating to the Company" and "Business - Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry" which identify important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Domestic Operations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental operates its domestic route system primarily through its hubs at Newark International Airport ("Newark"), George Bush Intercontinental Airport ("Bush Intercontinental") in Houston and Hopkins International Airport
("Hopkins International") in Cleveland.  The Company's hub system allows it to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly.  The hub system also allows
Continental to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft.  As of January 19, 2001, Continental operated 55% of the average daily jet departures from Newark, 78% of the average daily jet
departures from Bush Intercontinental, and 50% of the average daily jet departures from Hopkins International (in each case excluding regional jets).  Each of Continental's domestic hubs is located in a large business and population center, contributing
to a high volume of "origin and destination" traffic.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Continental Express</U>.  Continental Airlines' jet service at each of its domestic hub cities is coordinated with Express, which operates new-generation regional jets and turboprop aircraft under the name "Continental Express".
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of January 19, 2001, Express served 70 cities in the U.S., ten cities in Mexico and five cities in Canada by regional jets.  In addition, commuter feed traffic is currently provided to Continental by other code-sharing partners.
 See "Alliances" below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Management believes Express's regional jet and turboprop operations complement Continental's jet operations by allowing more frequent service to small cities than could be provided economically with conventional jet aircraft and by
carrying traffic that connects onto Continental's jets. Continental believes that Express's new regional jets provide greater comfort and enjoy better customer acceptance than turboprop aircraft.  The regional jets also allow Express to serve certain
routes that cannot be served by its turboprop aircraft. Continental anticipates that Express's fleet will be entirely comprised of regional jets by 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">International Operations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental directly serves destinations throughout Europe, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean, as well as Tokyo and Tel Aviv, and has extensive operations in the western Pacific conducted by CMI.  As
measured by 2000 available seat miles, approximately 38.0% of Continental's jet operations, including CMI, were dedicated to international traffic, compared with 36.2% in 1999.  As of January 19, 2001, the Company offered 152 weekly departures to 16
European cities and marketed service to 31 other cities through code-sharing agreements. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company's Newark hub is a significant international gateway.  From Newark at January 19, 2001, the Company served 16 European cities, five Canadian cities, six Mexican cities, four Central American cities, five South American
cities, ten Caribbean destinations, Tel Aviv and Tokyo and marketed numerous other destinations through code-sharing arrangements with foreign carriers.  Continental announced that it will inaugurate daily non-stop service between Newark and Hong Kong,
effective March 1, 2001, and between Newark and London/Stansted, effective May 1, 2001.  In addition, the Company announced that it would begin daily non-stop service between Newark and Buenos Aires, Argentina effective December 1, 2001, subject to
government approval.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company's Houston hub is the focus of its operations in Mexico and Central America.  As of January 19, 2001, Continental flew from Houston to 20 cities in Mexico, every country in Central America, six cities in South America,
two Caribbean destinations, three cities in Canada, two cities in Europe and Tokyo.  Express also serviced seven additional cities in Mexico by regional jets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental also flies to London, Montreal, Toronto, San Juan and Cancun from its hub in Cleveland.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Continental Micronesia</U>.  CMI is a United States-certificated air carrier transporting passengers, cargo and mail in the western Pacific.  From its hub operations based on the island of Guam, CMI provides service to eight
cities in Japan, more than any other United States carrier, as well as other Pacific rim destinations, including Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and Indonesia.  Service to these Japanese cities and certain other Pacific Rim
destinations is subject to a variety of regulatory restrictions limiting the ability of other carriers to serve these markets.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;CMI is the principal air carrier in the Micronesian Islands, where it pioneered scheduled air service in 1968.  CMI's route system is linked to the United States market through Tokyo and Honolulu, each of which CMI serves non-stop
from Guam.  CMI and Continental also maintain a code-sharing agreement and coordinate schedules on certain flights from the west coast of the United States to Honolulu, and from Honolulu to Guam, to facilitate travel from the United States into CMI's
route system.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alliances</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental has entered into and continues to develop alliances with domestic carriers.  In 1998, the Company entered into a long-term global alliance with Northwest Airlines, Inc. ("Northwest Airlines") (the "Northwest
Alliance").  Contemporaneously with the commencement of the Northwest Alliance, Northwest Airlines Corporation ("Northwest") purchased from a stockholder of the Company approximately 8.7 million shares of Class A common stock, par value $.01 per share
("Class A common stock") of the Company.  On January 22, 2001, the Company repurchased approximately 6.7 million of such shares for $450 million, and reclassified all issued shares of Class A common stock into Class B common stock, par value $.01 per
share ("Class B common stock") (see the "Northwest Transaction").  At the same time, Continental and Northwest Airlines extended the term of the Northwest Alliance through 2025, subject to earlier termination by either carrier in the event of certain
changes in control of either Northwest Airlines or Continental.  The Northwest Alliance provides that each carrier will place its code on a large number of the flights of the other and includes reciprocity of frequent flyer programs and executive lounge
access.  Significant other joint marketing activities are being undertaken, while preserving the separate identities of the carriers. Northwest Airlines and Continental have also begun to enter into joint contracts with major corporations and travel
agents with the objective of creating access to a broader product line encompassing the route systems of both carriers.  Continental has also entered into agreements to code share with certain Northwest Airlines regional affiliates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental also has domestic code-sharing agreements with America West Airlines, Inc. ("America West"), Gulfstream International Airlines, Inc. ("Gulfstream"), Mesaba Aviation, Inc., Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., Alaska Airlines, Inc.
("Alaska Air"), Horizon Airlines, Inc., Champlain Enterprises, Inc., dba CommutAir and American Eagle Airlines, Inc.  Continental also owns 28% of the common equity of Gulfstream.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In addition to domestic alliances, Continental seeks to develop international alliance relationships that complement the Company's own flying and permit expanded service through its hubs to major international destinations.
International alliances assist the Company in the development of its route structure by enabling the Company to offer more frequencies in a market, by providing passengers connecting service from Continental's international flights to other destinations
beyond an alliance partner's hub, or by expanding the product line that Continental may offer in a foreign destination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental has implemented international code-sharing agreements with Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, S.P.A. ("Alitalia"), Air China, Emirates (the flag carrier of the United Arab Emirates),<B> </B>EVA Airways Corporation, an
airline based in Taiwan, Virgin Atlantic Airways ("Virgin"), Societe Air France ("Air France") and Compania Panamena de Aviacion, S.A. ("Copa").  Continental also owns 49% of the common equity of Copa. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Certain of Continental's code-sharing agreements involve block-space arrangements (pursuant to which carriers agree to share capacity and bear economic risk for blocks of seats on certain routes). Continental and Air France
purchase blocks of seats on each other's flights between Houston and Newark and Paris.  Continental and Virgin exchange blocks of seats on each other's flights between Newark and London, and Continental purchases blocks of seats on eight other routes
flown by Virgin between the United Kingdom and the United States.  Continental's block-space arrangement with Alitalia will be terminated effective March 25, 2001. The Company and Air France are continuing to discuss terminating certain portions of their
alliance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Most of the Company's larger U.S. competitors are members of global airline groups involving multi-carrier marketing activities.  Continental does not currently have an agreement to join such a group, and it is likely that any
group formed by Continental in the future would be smaller than some of these groups.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Marketing</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As with other carriers, most tickets for travel on Continental are sold by travel agents.  Travel agents generally receive commissions measured by a certain percentage of the price of tickets sold.  Airlines often pay additional
commissions in connection with special revenue programs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>E-Ticket</U>.  In 2000, Continental expanded its electronic ticketing ("E-Ticket") product to approximately 95% of its destinations.  E-Tickets result in lower distribution costs to the Company while providing enhanced customer
and revenue information.  Continental recorded over $5.8 billion in E-Ticket sales in 2000, representing 54% of total sales.  During 2000, Continental replaced its airport E-Ticket machines with new state-of-the-art eService Centers, self-service kiosks
for customer check-in, in over 50 U.S. airports.  Continental and America West were the first U.S. airlines to implement interline E-Ticketing allowing customers to use electronic tickets when their itineraries include travel on both carriers.  In 2000,
the Company implemented interline E-Ticketing with Northwest Airlines and plans to implement interline E-Ticketing with its alliance partners and some of the other large U.S. carriers.  The Company expects these features to contribute to an increase in
E-Ticket usage and a further reduction in distribution costs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Internet</U>.  Continental's award winning website, www.continental.com recorded over $320 million in ticket sales in 2000, compared with over $165 million in ticket sales in 1999. The site offers customers direct access to
information such as schedules, reservations, flight status, cargo tracking and Continental Online travel specials, a free weekly email containing special offers for weekend travel.  New customer service features in 2000 include flight status notification
via text messaging tools and a downloadable timetable.  Combined with online travel agents, the Company recorded over $665 million in ticket sales through the internet during 2000, compared with over $305 million in 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Other</U>.  Continental is using e-commerce to improve distribution for the customer as well as reducing distribution costs.  Continental, along with United Air Lines, Inc. ("United"), American Airlines, Inc. ("American"), Delta
Air Lines, Inc. ("Delta") and Northwest Airlines, own a majority interest in a comprehensive travel planning website, ORBITZ, which will offer customers unlimited access to a wide variety of unbiased travel options.  To date, 29 U.S. and foreign carriers
have signed up to join the web-based travel service.  ORBITZ will provide customers with convenient online access to airline, hotel, car rental and other travel services in addition to internet offers.  The site will feature published fares from virtually
all carriers worldwide and will welcome the posting of internet fares from other carriers as well.  In addition, Continental has entered into marketing agreements with other web-based travel service companies such as Biz Travel, Hotwire and Site59.com.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frequent Flyer Program</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental has established a frequent flyer program, "OnePass", designed to encourage repeat travel on its system.  Continental's OnePass program currently allows passengers to earn mileage credits by flying Continental and
certain other carriers including Northwest Airlines, America West, Alaska Air, Alitalia, Air France, Qantas Airways, Copa and Gulfstream.  The Company also sells mileage credits to credit card companies, phone companies, hotels, car rental agencies and
others participating in the OnePass program.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Due to the structure of the program and the low level of redemptions as a percentage of total travel, Continental believes that displacement of revenue passengers by passengers using flight awards has historically been minimal.
The number of awards used on Continental represented 7.6% and 7% of Continental's total revenue passenger miles in 2000 and 1999, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In 2000, Continental entered into a marketing agreement with MilePoint.com, a new website that allows frequent flyer customers to trade accumulated miles for discounts on online merchandise.  To date, the Company, Delta, Northwest
Airlines, US Airways, Inc. ("US Airways"), and America West are participants and equity owners.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employees</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately 54,300 employees (48,400 full-time equivalent employees, including approximately 21,150 customer service agents, reservations agents, ramp and other airport personnel, 9,000
flight attendants, 7,600 management and clerical employees, 6,500 pilots, 4,000 mechanics and 150 dispatchers).  Labor costs are a significant component of the Company's expenses and can substantially impact airline results.  In 2000, labor costs
(including employee incentives) constituted 30.9% of the Company's total operating expenses.  While there can be no assurance that the Company's generally good labor relations and high labor productivity will continue, management has established as a
significant component of its business strategy the preservation of good relations with the Company's employees, approximately 41% of whom are represented by unions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;See Item 7.  "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a table of the Company's, Express's and CMI's principal collective bargaining agreements,
and their respective amendable dates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Industry Regulation and Airport Access</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental and its subsidiaries operate under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the Department of Transportation ("DOT").  Such certificates may be altered, amended, modified or suspended by the DOT if
public convenience and necessity so require, or may be revoked for intentional failure to comply with the terms and conditions of a certificate.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The airlines are also regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"), primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance, ground facilities and other technical matters.  Pursuant to these regulations, Continental
has established, and the FAA has approved, a maintenance program for each type of aircraft operated by the Company that provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The DOT allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems, provided such procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation
system.  Certain airports, including the major airports at Boston, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County (California) and San Francisco, have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft
types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations.  In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increases in operating costs, and such restrictions could limit the
ability of Continental to expand its operations at the affected airports.  Local authorities at other airports are considering adopting similar noise regulations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Airports from time to time seek to increase the rates charged to airlines, and the ability of airlines to contest such increases has been restricted by federal legislation, DOT regulations and judicial decisions.   In addition,
some public airports impose passenger facility charges of up to $4.50 per segment for a maximum of $18 per roundtrip.  With certain exceptions, these charges are passed on to customers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The FAA has designated John F. Kennedy International Airport ("Kennedy") and LaGuardia Airport ("LaGuardia") in New York, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago ("O'Hare") and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in
Washington, D.C. ("Reagan National") as "high density traffic airports" and has limited the number of departure and arrival slots at those airports.  In April 2000, legislation was signed eliminating slot restrictions beginning in 2001 at O'Hare and 2007
at LaGuardia and Kennedy.  Elimination of slot restrictions at O'Hare, LaGuardia and Kennedy already began through exemptions for new entrants and small aircraft serving small and non-hub airports.  Express has been awarded slot exemptions to provide
service at LaGuardia using regional jets.  The Borough of Queens, the City of New York and the Mayor of New York have asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review and reverse the DOT's decisions awarding slot exemptions at LaGuardia
and Kennedy to Express and other carriers.  Subsequent to the award of slot exemptions at LaGuardia, the FAA reduced the number of slot exemptions available there effective January 31, 2001, to ameliorate congestion and delays, and Express will now have
only a limited number of slot exemptions available at LaGuardia.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The availability of international routes to U.S. carriers is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the United States and foreign governments.  The United States typically follows the practice of encouraging foreign
governments to accept multiple carrier designation on foreign routes, although certain countries have sought to limit the number of carriers.  Foreign route authorities may become less valuable to the extent that the United States and other countries
adopt "open skies" policies liberalizing entry on international routes.  Continental cannot predict what laws and regulations will be adopted or their impact, but the impact could be significant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Many aspects of Continental's operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting the environment.  Future regulatory developments could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs
in the airline industry.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northwest Transaction</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On November 15, 2000, Continental entered into a number of agreements with Northwest and some of its affiliates under which it would, among other things, repurchase approximately 6.7 million shares of Class A common stock owned by
Northwest, reclassify all issued shares of Class A common stock into Class B common stock, make other adjustments to its corporate and alliance relationship with Northwest Airlines and issue to Northwest Airlines one share of preferred stock, designated
as Series B preferred stock ("Series B preferred stock") with blocking rights relating to certain change of control transactions involving Continental and certain matters relating to Continental's rights plan.  The transactions closed on January 22, 2001.
 Under the agreements relating to the recapitalization, Continental and Northwest agreed to seek dismissal of the antitrust litigation brought by the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") against Northwest and Continental, which dismissal was granted on
January 22, 2001.  See Item 3.  "Legal Proceedings - Antitrust Litigation".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Repurchase of Shares of Class A Common Stock</U>.  On January 22, 2001, Continental repurchased from Northwest and an affiliate 6,685,279 shares of Continental Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $450 million
in cash (or approximately $67 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The shares repurchased represented approximately 77% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock owned by Northwest, excluding shares subject to a limited proxy held by Northwest.  This limited proxy terminated upon the
closing of the recapitalization.  After giving effect to the repurchase and the reclassification of the issued shares of Class A common stock into Class B common stock, Northwest's general voting power with respect to Continental, including Northwest's
right to vote certain shares under a limited proxy, was reduced from approximately 59.6% to approximately 7.2%.  This percentage does not include the share of Series B preferred stock issued to Northwest Airlines in the recapitalization, which does not
have general voting rights but instead has a special class vote on certain change of control transactions as described below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Reclassification of Shares of Class A Common Stock</U>.  At the effective time of the recapitalization, the remaining 1,975,945 shares of Class A common stock owned by Northwest that Continental did not purchase, as well as all
other issued shares of Class A common stock, were reclassified into Class B common stock at an exchange rate of 1.32 shares of Class B common stock per share of Class A common stock.  Unlike the shares of Class A common stock, which were entitled to ten
votes per share, the shares of Class B common stock are entitled to one vote per share.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Amendment of Master Alliance Agreement</U>.  In connection with the recapitalization, the master alliance agreement between Continental and Northwest Airlines, pursuant to which certain joint marketing activities (such as code
sharing, reciprocal frequent flyer programs and executive lounge access) are undertaken, was extended through 2025, with automatic five-year renewals thereafter unless either party gives three years' advance notice of nonrenewal.  The master alliance
agreement was also amended so that it will be terminable by either Northwest Airlines or, under certain limited circumstances, Continental with six months' prior written notice in the event of a change of control of Continental, and by either Continental
or Northwest Airlines with six months prior written notice in the event of a change of control of Northwest Airlines.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Issuance of Series B Preferred Stock</U>.  In connection with the transactions described above, including the amendment of the master alliance agreement described above, Continental issued to Northwest Airlines one share of
Series B preferred stock for consideration of $100 in cash.  The Series B preferred stock gives Northwest Airlines the right to vote, as a separate class, during the term of the master alliance agreement or, if earlier, until the Series B preferred stock
becomes redeemable, on:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Except for the right to vote on any amendment to Continental's certificate of incorporation that would adversely affect the Series B preferred stock, and on any other matter as may be required by law, the Series B preferred stock
does not have any other voting rights. The voting rights of the Series B preferred stock will be eliminated and the Series B preferred stock will, at Continental's option, be redeemable if:</P>

</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Purchase of Right of First Offer</U>.  In connection with the recapitalization, Continental paid 1992 Air, Inc. $10 million in cash for its sale to Continental of its right of first offer to purchase the shares of Class A common
stock that the Company purchased from Northwest (which right terminated immediately after the recapitalization).  1992 Air, Inc. is an affiliate of David Bonderman, one of Continental's directors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Standstill Agreement</U>.  In connection with the recapitalization, Northwest and certain of its affiliates have entered into a standstill agreement with the Company that contains standstill and conduct restrictions that are
substantially similar to those previously contained in the corporate governance agreement that had been in place between the parties.  However, the percentage of Continental stock that Northwest and its affiliates may own has been adjusted downward to
reflect their holdings following the recapitalization and will be adjusted downward to reflect any subsequent dispositions by them of Continental common stock, and upward if their percentage ownership increases as a result of decreases in the number of
outstanding shares of Continental common stock.  The agreement restricts Northwest and its affiliates from increasing their percentage ownership of shares of Continental stock or otherwise attempting to control or influence the Company.  Under the
agreement, Northwest agreed to vote neutrally all of Continental's common stock owned by it after the recapitalization, except that Northwest will be free to vote its shares in its discretion with respect to a change of control of the Company, as defined
in the Series B preferred stock certificate of designations, and will vote neutrally or as recommended by Continental's board of directors with respect to the election of directors.  The standstill agreement provides that Northwest will be released from
its obligations if Continental publicly announces that it is seeking, or has entered into an agreement with, a third party to acquire a majority of Continental's voting securities or all or substantially all of Continental's airline assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Amendment of the Rights Agreement</U>.  Continental has also amended its rights agreement to take into account, among other things, the effects of the recapitalization and to eliminate Northwest's status as an exempt person that
would not trigger the provisions of the rights agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Adoption of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation</U>.  The Company's certificate of incorporation was amended to:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Continental/Northwest Alliance</U>.  In November 1998, the Company and Northwest Airlines began implementing a long-term global alliance involving extensive code-sharing, frequent flyer reciprocity, and other cooperative
activities.  Implementation of the Northwest Alliance continued throughout 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The alliance agreement provides that if by January 25, 2002 the Company has not entered into a code share with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines ("KLM") or is not legally able (but for aeropolitical restrictions) to enter into a new
transatlantic joint venture with KLM and Northwest Airlines and place its airline code on certain Northwest Airlines flights, Northwest Airlines can elect to (i) cause good faith negotiations among the Company, KLM and Northwest Airlines as to the impact,
if any, on the contribution to the joint venture described below resulting from the absence of the code share, and the Company will reimburse the joint venture for the amount of any loss until it enters into a code-share arrangement with KLM, or (ii)
terminate (subject to cure rights of the Company) after one year's notice any or all of such alliance agreement and any or all of the agreements contemplated thereunder.  As of January 22, 2001, the Company had not entered into a code share with KLM.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The alliance agreement also provides that subject to the receipt by Northwest Airlines, KLM and the Company of an adequate grant of antitrust immunity and within one year after all contractual and technical impediments have been
removed, the Company shall join, as an economic participant, a new transatlantic joint venture with Northwest Airlines and KLM. The Company has not yet applied for such antitrust immunity, and not all such impediments have been removed.  The alliance
agreement provides that Northwest Airlines and KLM will negotiate in good faith with each other and with the Company the share of the new transatlantic joint venture to which the Company will be entitled. If the three carriers are unable to agree on the
profit shares of the new transatlantic joint venture, they will submit the matter to arbitration in accordance with the alliance agreement's dispute resolution procedures.  In such a case, the arbitrator(s) will only be permitted to choose one award from
those submitted by each of  the carriers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Risk Factors Relating to the Company</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>High Leverage and Significant Financing Needs</U>.  Continental has a higher proportion of debt compared to its equity capital than some of its principal competitors.  In addition, Continental has less cash resources than some
of its principal competitors.  A majority of Continental's property and equipment is subject to liens securing indebtedness.  Accordingly, Continental may be less able than some of its competitors to withstand a prolonged recession in the airline industry
or respond as flexibly to changing economic and competitive conditions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of December 31, 2000, Continental had approximately $3.7 billion (including current maturities) of long-term debt and capital lease obligations and approximately $1.9 billion of Continental-obligated mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of trust, redeemable common stock and common stockholders' equity.  Also at December 31, 2000, Continental had $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental has substantial commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft.  As of December 31, 2000, Continental had agreed to acquire or lease a total of 86 additional Boeing jet aircraft
through 2005.  The Company anticipates taking delivery of 35 Boeing jet aircraft in 2001.  Continental also has options for an additional 105 aircraft (exercisable subject to certain conditions).  The estimated aggregate cost of the Company's firm
commitments for Boeing aircraft is approximately $4 billion.  Continental currently plans to finance its new Boeing aircraft with a combination of enhanced pass through trust certificates, lease equity and other third-party financing, subject to
availability and market conditions.  As of December 31, 2000, Continental had approximately $890 million in financing arranged for such Boeing deliveries.  Continental also has commitments or letters of intent for backstop financing for approximately 23%
of the anticipated remaining acquisition cost of future Boeing deliveries.  In addition, at December 31, 2000, Continental had firm commitments to purchase 26 spare engines related to the new Boeing aircraft for approximately $158 million, which will be
deliverable through March 2005.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of December 31, 2000, Express had firm commitments for 178 Embraer regional jets with options for an additional 100 Embraer regional jets exercisable through 2007.  Express anticipates taking delivery of 41 regional jets in
2001. The estimated cost of the Company's firm commitments for Embraer regional jets is approximately $3 billion.  Neither Express nor Continental will have any obligation to take any such firm Embraer aircraft that are not financed by a third party and
leased to Continental. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;For 2000, cash expenditures under operating leases relating to aircraft approximated $864 million, compared to $758 million for 1999, and approximated $353 million relating to facilities and other rentals compared to $328 million
in 1999.  Continental expects that its operating lease expenses for 2001 will increase over 2000 amounts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Additional financing will be needed to satisfy the Company's capital commitments.  Continental cannot predict whether sufficient financing will be available for capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Continental's Historical Operating Results</U>.  Continental has recorded positive net income in each of the last six years.  However, Continental experienced significant operating losses in the previous eight years.
Historically, the financial results of the U.S. airline industry have been cyclical.  Continental cannot predict whether current industry conditions will continue.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Significant Cost of Aircraft Fuel</U>.  Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of Continental's operating expense.  Fuel costs were approximately 15.6% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 and 9.7% for
the year ended December 31, 1999 (excluding fleet disposition/impairment losses). Fuel prices and supplies are influenced significantly by international political and economic circumstances.  Continental enters into petroleum swap contracts, petroleum
call option contracts and/or jet fuel purchase commitments to provide some short-term protection (generally three to six months) against a sharp increase in jet fuel prices. The Company's fuel hedging strategy could result in the Company not fully
benefiting from certain fuel price declines.  If a fuel supply shortage were to arise from OPEC production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, higher fuel prices or reduction of scheduled airline service could result.  Significant
changes in fuel costs or continuation of high current jet fuel prices would materially affect Continental's operating results.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Labor Costs</U>.  Labor costs constitute a significant percentage of the Company's total operating costs, and the Company experiences competitive pressure to increase wages and benefits.  In July 2000, the Company completed a
three-year program bringing all employees to industry standard wages and also announced and began to implement a phased plan to bring employee benefits to industry standard levels by 2003.  The plan provides for increases in vacation, paid holidays,
increased 401(k) Company matching contributions and additional past service retirement credit for most senior employees.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Certain Tax Matters</U>.  At December 31, 2000, Continental had estimated net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") of $1 billion for federal income tax purposes that will expire through 2021 and federal investment tax credit
carryforwards of $45 million that will expire through 2001.  Due to an ownership change of Continental on April 27, 1993, the ultimate utilization of Continental's NOLs and investment tax credits may be limited, as described below.  Reflecting this
limitation, Continental had a valuation allowance of $263 million at December 31, 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental had, as of December 31, 2000, deferred tax assets aggregating $677 million, including $366 million related to NOLs.  The Company has consummated several transactions that resulted in the recognition of NOLs of the
Company's predecessor.  To the extent the Company were to determine in the future that additional NOLs of the Company's predecessor could be recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, such benefit would reduce the value ascribed to
routes, gates and slots.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 382") imposes limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an "ownership change."  In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions
increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period.  In the event that an ownership change occurred, utilization of Continental's NOLs would be subject to an annual
limitation under Section 382 determined by multiplying the value of Continental's stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate (which was 5.39% for December 2000).  Any unused annual limitation may be carried over
to later years, and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in assets held by Continental at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change.  Under current
conditions, if an ownership change were to occur, Continental's annual NOL utilization would be limited to approximately $174 million per year other than through the recognition of future built-in gain transactions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In November 1998, Northwest completed its acquisition of certain equity of the Company previously held by Air Partners, L.P. and its affiliates, together with certain Class A common stock of the Company held by other investors,
totaling 8,661,224 shares of the Class A common stock. On January 22, 2001, Continental repurchased 6,685,279 shares of Continental Class A common stock from Northwest and an affiliate.  In addition, each issued share of Continental Class A common stock
was reclassified into 1.32 shares of Class B common stock in a nontaxable transaction.  The Company does not believe that these transactions resulted in an ownership change for purposes of Section 382.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;<U>Continental Micronesia's Dependence on the Japanese Economy; Currency Risk</U>.  Because the majority of CMI's traffic originates in Japan, its results of operations are substantially affected by the Japanese economy and
changes in the value of the yen as compared to the dollar.  To reduce the potential negative impact on CMI's earnings, the Company has entered into forward contracts as a hedge against a portion of its expected net yen cash flow position.  As of December
31, 2000, the Company had hedged approximately 75% of 2001 projected yen-denominated net cash flows at a rate of 99 yen to $1 US.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Risks Factors Relating to the Airline Industry</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Competition and Industry Conditions</U>.  The airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting.  Carriers have used discount fares to stimulate traffic during periods of slack demand, to generate cash
flow and to increase market share.  Some of Continental's competitors have substantially greater financial resources or lower cost structures than Continental.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Airline profit levels are highly sensitive to changes in fuel costs, fare levels and passenger demand.  Passenger demand and fare levels have in the past been influenced by, among other things, the general state of the economy
(both internationally and domestically), international events, airline capacity and pricing actions taken by carriers.  Domestically, from 1990 to 1993, the weak U.S. economy, turbulent international events and extensive price discounting by carriers
contributed to unprecedented losses for U.S. airlines.  In the last several years, the U.S. economy has improved and excessive price discounting has abated.  Continental cannot predict the extent to which these industry conditions will continue. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In recent years, the major U.S. airlines have sought to form marketing alliances with other U.S. and foreign air carriers.  Such alliances generally provide for "code-sharing", frequent flyer reciprocity, coordinated scheduling of
flights of each alliance member to permit convenient connections and other joint marketing activities.  Such arrangements permit an airline to market flights operated by other alliance members as its own.  This increases the destinations, connections and
frequencies offered by the airline, which provide an opportunity to increase traffic on its segment of flights connecting with its alliance partners.  The Northwest Alliance is an example of such an arrangement, and Continental has existing alliances with
numerous other air carriers.  Other major U.S. airlines have alliances or planned alliances more extensive than Continental's.  Continental cannot predict the extent to which it will benefit from its alliances or be disadvantaged by competing alliances.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In recent years, and particularly since its deregulation in 1978, the U.S. airline industry has also undergone substantial consolidation, and it may in the future undergo additional consolidation.  For example, in May 2000, United,
the nation's largest commercial airline, announced its agreement to acquire US Airways, the nation's sixth largest commercial airline, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions.  In addition, in January 2001, American announced agreements to
acquire the majority of Trans World Airlines, Inc.'s assets and some of US Airways' assets, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions.  Continental routinely monitors changes in the competitive landscape and engages in analysis and discussions
regarding its strategic position, including alliances and business combination transactions.  Continental has had, and anticipates it will continue to have, discussions with third parties regarding strategic alternatives.  The impact on Continental of
these pending transactions and any additional consolidation within the U.S. airline industry cannot be predicted at this time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Regulatory Matters</U>.  Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that engender significant costs.  In the last several years, the FAA has issued a number of directives and other regulations
relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that have required significant expenditures.  Some FAA requirements cover, among other things, retirement of older aircraft, security measures, collision avoidance systems, airborne windshear avoidance
systems, noise abatement, commuter aircraft safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft.  Continental expects to continue incurring expenses in complying with the FAA's regulations.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues.  For instance, "passenger bill of rights"
legislation has been introduced in Congress that would, among other things, require the payment of compensation to passengers as a result of certain delays, and limit the ability of carriers to prohibit or restrict usage of certain tickets in manners
currently prohibited or restricted.  The DOT has proposed rules that would significantly limit major carriers' ability to compete with new entrant carriers.  If adopted, these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices, reducing revenue and
increasing costs.  Restrictions on the ownership and transfer of airline routes and takeoff and landing slots have also been proposed.  See "Industry Regulation and Airport Access" above.  The ability of U.S. carriers to operate international routes is
subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the United States and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, or because appropriate slots or facilities are not made available.  Continental cannot provide assurance that laws or
regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Seasonal Nature of Airline Business; Other</U>.  Due to greater demand for air travel during the summer months, revenue in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year is generally stronger than revenue in
the first and fourth quarters of the year for most U.S. air carriers.  Continental's results of operations generally reflect this seasonality, but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal, including the extent
and nature of competition from other airlines, fare wars, excise and similar taxes, changing levels of operations, fuel prices, weather, air traffic control delays, foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company's principal facilities are located at Newark, Bush Intercontinental, Hopkins International and A.B. Won Pat International Airport in Guam.  Substantially all of  these facilities and Continental's other facilities are
leased on a long-term, net-rental basis, and Continental is responsible for maintenance, taxes, insurance and other facility-related expenses and services. At each of its three domestic hub cities and most other locations, Continental's passenger and
baggage handling space is leased directly from the airport authority on varying terms dependent on prevailing practice at each airport.  Continental also maintains administrative offices, airport and terminal facilities, training facilities and other
facilities related to the airline business in the cities it serves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental has entered into agreements with the City of Houston, Texas, the City of Cleveland, Ohio, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, the Department of Transportation of the State of Hawaii, the Regional Airports
Improvement Corporation, and the Harris County (Houston) Industrial Development Corporation to provide funds for constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring equipment which have been or will be leased to Continental.  In connection
therewith, Continental has unconditionally guaranteed the principal and interest on certain bonds totaling approximately $1.6 billion and has entered into long-term leases with the respective authorities under which rental payments will be sufficient to
service the related bonds.  The leases generally have terms ranging from 20 to 30 years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During 2000, construction continued under Continental's Global Gateway Program at Newark International Airport.  The program includes construction of a new concourse in Terminal C and other facility improvements.  The project is
currently ahead of schedule and is expected to be completed in 2002.  During 2000, Continental also began plans for the construction of the International Services Expansion Program ("ISEP") with the City of Houston at Bush Intercontinental.  Continental's
portion of the ISEP includes a new international terminal, a new international ticketing facility, a new cargo facility and various other support facilities and improvements to the Company's existing leased property at Bush Intercontinental.  The Company
plans to finance its portion of the ISEP with bond financing made available through the City of Houston.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>United States of America v. Northwest Airlines Corp. &amp; Continental Airlines, Inc.,</U>  in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division.  In this litigation, the Antitrust Division
of the DOJ challenged under Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act the acquisition by Northwest of shares of Continental's Class A common stock bearing, together with certain shares for which Northwest had a limited proxy, more than
50% of the fully diluted voting power of all Continental stock.  The government's position was that, notwithstanding various agreements that restricted Northwest's ability to exercise voting control over Continental and were designed to assure
Continental's competitive independence, Northwest's control of the Class A common stock would reduce actual and potential competition in various ways and in a variety of markets.  The government sought an order requiring Northwest to divest all voting
stock in Continental on terms and conditions agreeable to the government and the Court.  Under the Northwest Agreements, Continental and Northwest supported an adjournment of the DOJ lawsuit pending closing of the transaction (which adjournment was
granted by the U.S. District Court on November 6, 2000) and agreed to seek dismissal of the DOJ litigation upon or promptly after the closing.  The U.S. District Court entered an order dismissing this litigation on January 22, 2001.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On July 25, 2000 a Concorde aircraft operated by Air France crashed shortly after takeoff from France's Charles de Gaulle airport, killing  114 people, most of whom were tourists on board the chartered aircraft, which was also
destroyed.  The interim investigation conducted by French authorities suggests that one of the aircraft's tires burst and that portions of the resulting debris struck the underside of a wing of the aircraft which caused the rupture of a fuel tank, leading
to a fire and the crash.  In early September 2000, Continental learned that a small piece of metal found on the runway after the Concorde took off is believed by the French authorities to have caused or contributed to the tire failure and is suspected by
investigators to have come from a Continental DC10 aircraft that had taken off on the same runway a short time before the Concorde.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The following lawsuits involving the Company have been filed to date in connection with the accident, which remains under investigation: <U>Air France and its Insurers v. Continental Airlines, Inc., USAU, Inc, and USAIG</U> filed
on September 15, 2000 before the Commercial Court of Pontoise, France, in which the plaintiffs seek damages for indemnification paid to the passengers' families and other parties, for destruction of the aircraft, and for any other expenses and costs
incurred by Air France; and Case No. 00-07707, <U>In re: Petition of Ina Frentzen, Rita Frentzen-Bien, and Ralf Frentzen Requesting Depositions Before Suit</U> filed on September 29, 2000 in the District Court for Dallas County, Texas, D-95th Judicial District (Parties in interest include Continental
Airlines, Inc. and The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company), in which the plaintiffs seek  to depose certain parties, including officers and employees of the Company, prior to determining whether to file suit against the Company and certain other parties;
and Case No. 01CIV.0149, <U>Dr. Hans-Joachim Schnitter, Dietmar Schnitter, Kerstin Hoffman, Carola Wagner and Annette Friedland v. Air France, S.A., Continental Airlines, Inc., BAE Systems plc, European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company N.V., The Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Company, General Electric Company, MRA Systems, Inc.</U>, filed on January 9, 2001 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which the plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages in connection with the deaths of three passengers on board the Concorde at the time of
the loss. The Company anticipates that additional suits will be filed against the Company in the future connected with this accident.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The foregoing litigation is in preliminary stages. The Company is cooperating with French and U.S. authorities in the investigation of the accident. Although the outcome of such suits or any future litigation cannot be known at
this time, the Company's costs to defend these matters and, the Company believes, any potential liability exposure are covered by insurance.  Consequently, management does not expect the foregoing litigation or any additional suits that may arise from the
accident to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Environmental Proceedings</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (commonly known as "Superfund") and similar state environment cleanup laws, generators of waste disposed of at designated
sites may, under certain circumstances, be subject to joint and several liability for investigation and remediation costs.  The Company (including its predecessors) has been identified as a potentially responsible party at six federal and two state sites
that are undergoing or have undergone investigation or remediation.  The Company has entered into a settlement agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") with respect to five of the federal sites.  The settlement agreement provides for the
EPA to receive an allowed unsecured claim of approximately $1.3 million under the Company's Plan of Reorganization and approximately $230,000 in cash, in full satisfaction of any and all of the Company's liabilities relating to such sites.  In addition,
the Company has settled one of the state sites for a de minimis amount.  With respect to the remaining sites, the Company believes that, although applicable case law is evolving and some cases may be interpreted to the contrary, some or all of any
liability claims associated with these sites were discharged by confirmation of the Company's 1993 Plan of Reorganization, principally because the Company's exposure is based on alleged offsite disposal known as of the date of confirmation.  Even if any
such claims were not discharged, on the basis of currently available information, the Company believes that its potential liability for its allocable share of the cost to remedy each site (to the extent the Company is found to have liability) is not, in
the aggregate, material; however, the Company has not been designated a "de minimis" contributor at any of such sites.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company is also and may from time to time become involved in other environmental matters, including the investigation and/or remediation of environmental conditions at properties used or previously used by the Company.
Although the Company is not currently subject to any environmental cleanup orders imposed by regulatory authorities, it is undertaking voluntary investigation or remediation at certain properties in consultation with such authorities.  The full nature and
extent of any contamination at these properties and the parties responsible for such contamination have not been determined, but based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that any environmental liability associated with such
properties will have a material adverse effect on the Company. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Various other claims and lawsuits against the Company are pending that are of the type generally consistent with the Company's business.  The Company cannot at this time reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that
could be experienced if any of the claims were successful. Many of such claims and lawsuits are covered in whole or in part by insurance.  The Company does not believe that the foregoing matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company.</P>

non-strategic assets and (iii) the amount of cash proceeds received by the Company for the purchase of common stock by employees and other participants under its employee stock purchase and stock option plans to continue to repurchase its common stock in
the future.  Certain of the Company's credit agreements and indentures restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or repurchase capital stock by imposing minimum unrestricted cash requirements on the Company,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements.  In connection therewith, please see the cautionary statements contained in Item 1.  "Business - Risk Factors Relating to the Company" and  "Business - Risk Factors
Relating to the Airline Industry" which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  Hereinafter, the terms "Continental" and the "Company" refer to Continental Airlines,
Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental's results of operations are impacted by seasonality (the second and third quarters are generally stronger than the first and fourth quarters) as well as numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal,
including the extent and nature of competition from other airlines, employee job actions (including at other airlines), fare sale activities, excise and similar taxes, changing levels of operations and capacity, fuel prices, weather, air traffic control
delays, foreign currency exchange rates, changes in regulations and aviation treaties and general economic conditions.  Rising jet fuel prices significantly impacted results of operations in 2000.  However, management believes the Company is well
positioned to respond to market conditions in the event of a sustained economic downturn due to its flexible fleet plan, a strong cash balance and a well developed alliance network.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Results of Operations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The following discussion provides an analysis of the Company's results of operations and reasons for material changes therein for the three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Comparison of 2000 to 1999</U>.  The Company recorded consolidated net income of $342 million and $455 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Net income in 2000 included a $6 million after-tax
gain on the sale of a right of first refusal and the Company's investment in America West Holdings Corporation ("America West Holdings") and a $6 million extraordinary charge from the early repayment of debt.  Net income in 1999 was significantly impacted
by several non-recurring items, including $200 million of after-tax gains on the sale of the Company's interest in AMADEUS Global Travel Distribution S.A. ("AMADEUS") and other investments, a $50 million after-tax fleet disposition/impairment loss related
to the early retirement of several DC-10-30's and other items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes ($33 million, net of taxes) related to the write-off of pilot training costs and a change in the method of accounting for the sale of mileage
credits to participating partners in the Company's frequent flyer program. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Passenger revenue increased 14.7%, $1.2 billion, during 2000 as compared to 1999.  The increase was principally due to new transatlantic and Latin American destinations served as well as an improvement in yield and load factor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Cargo and mail revenue increased 18.8%, $57 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to increased international volumes resulting from new markets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Wages, salaries and related costs increased 13.3%, $335 million, during 2000 as compared to 1999, primarily due to a 5.8% increase in average full-time equivalent employees to support increased flying, increased employee incentives
and higher wage rates resulting from the Company's decision to increase employee wages to industry standard by the year 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Aircraft fuel expense increased 86.5%, $667 million, in 2000 as compared to the prior year.  The average price per gallon increased 83.2% from 47.31 cents in 1999 to 86.69 cents in 2000.  In addition, jet fuel consumption decreased
0.3% even with increased flight operations principally reflecting the fuel efficiency of the Company's younger fleet.  During 2000 and 1999, the Company recognized gains of approximately $44 million and $90 million, respectively, related to its fuel
hedging program. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Aircraft rentals increased 9.5%, $73 million, during 2000 as compared to 1999, due to the addition of newer aircraft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Maintenance, materials and repairs increased 7.1%, $43 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 due to an increase in line maintenance and the volume and timing of engine overhauls as part of the Company's ongoing maintenance program.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Landing fees and other rentals increased 7.0%, $35 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to higher facilities rent and landing fees resulting from increased operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Commissions expense decreased 8.7%, $50 million, during 2000 as compared to 1999 due to a lower volume of commissionable sales and lower rates resulting from international commission caps.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Reservations and sales expense increased 9.9%, $41 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to higher credit card fees resulting from increased sales.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Depreciation and amortization expense increased 11.7%, $42 million, in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to the addition of new aircraft and related spare parts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Passenger servicing expense increased 4.0%, $14 million, in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in food costs caused by an increase in passengers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During 1999, the Company made the decision to accelerate the retirement of six DC-10-30 aircraft and other items in 1999 and the first half of 2000 and to dispose of related excess inventory. In addition, the market value of
certain Boeing 747 aircraft no longer operated by the Company had declined.  As a result of these items and certain other fleet-related items, the Company recorded a fleet disposition/impairment loss of $81 million in 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Other operating expense increased 5.2%, $57 million, in 2000 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increases in outsourced services, travel and other incidental costs, and other miscellaneous expense.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Interest expense increased 7.7%, $18 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 due to an increase in long-term debt resulting from the purchase of new aircraft, partially offset by interest savings due to the conversion of the Company's
6-3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes into Class B common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Class B common stock"), in the second quarter of 1999 and the repurchase of the Company's remaining 9-1/2% senior unsecured notes in 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Interest income increased 22.5%, $16 million, in 2000 as compared to 1999 due to higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and due to higher interest rates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company's other nonoperating income (expense) in 2000 included a $9 million gain related to the sale of a right of first refusal and the Company's remaining investment in America West Holdings, partially offset by foreign
currency losses of $8 million.  Other nonoperating income (expense) in 1999 included a $33 million gain on the sale of a portion of the Company's interest in Equant N.V. ("Equant"), partially offset by foreign currency losses of $13 million, losses on
equity investments of $7 million and a $4 million loss on the sale of the Company's warrants to purchase common stock of priceline.com, Inc.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In 2000, an extraordinary charge of $6 million (net of income tax benefit) was recorded related to the early extinguishment of debt.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Comparison of 1999 to 1998</U>.  The Company recorded consolidated net income of $455 million and $383 million for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Net income in 1999 was significantly impacted by
several non-recurring items, including $200 million of after-tax gains on the sale of the Company's interest in AMADEUS and other investments, a $50 million after-tax fleet disposition/impairment loss related to the early retirement of several DC-10-30s
and other items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes ($33 million, net of taxes) related to the write-off of pilot training costs and a change in the method of accounting for the sale of mileage credits to participating partners in the
Company's frequent flyer program.  Net income in 1998 was significantly impacted by a $77 million after-tax fleet disposition/impairment loss resulting from the Company's decision to accelerate the retirement of certain jet and turboprop aircraft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Passenger revenue increased 8.9%, $660 million, during 1999 as compared to 1998.  The increase was due to an 11.3% increase in revenue passenger miles, partially offset by a 2.7% decrease in yield.  Both yield pressures in the
transatlantic markets and a 6.7% increase in average stage length caused the decrease in yield.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Cargo and mail revenue increased 10.2%, $28 million, in 1999 as compared to 1998 due to increased domestic and international volumes and new markets added in 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Other operating revenue increased 12.2%, $24 million, in 1999 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in fees charged to customers to change advance purchase tickets and also due to an increase in Presidents Club
revenue as a result of a larger number of these airport private clubs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Wages, salaries and related costs increased 13.2%, $292 million, during 1999 as compared to 1998, primarily due to an 8.3% increase in average full-time equivalent employees to support increased flying and higher wage rates
resulting from the Company's decision to increase employee wages to industry standard by the year 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Aircraft fuel expense increased 6.1%, $44 million, in 1999 as compared to the prior year.  The average price per gallon increased 1.0% from 46.83 cents in 1998 to 47.31 cents in 1999.  This increase is net of gains of approximately
$90 million recognized during 1999 related to the Company's fuel hedging program. In addition, the quantity of jet fuel used increased 3.7% principally reflecting increased capacity offset in part by the increased fuel efficiency of the Company's younger
fleet.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Aircraft rentals increased 17.0%, $112 million, during 1999 as compared to 1998, due to the delivery of new aircraft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Landing fees and other rentals increased 20.0%, $83 million, during 1999 as compared to 1998 primarily due to higher facilities rent due to increased rates and volume and higher landing fees resulting from increased operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Commissions expense decreased 1.2%, $7 million, during 1999 as compared to 1998 due to lower rates resulting from international commission caps and a lower volume of commissionable sales.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Reservations and sales expense increased 12.8%, $47 million, in 1999 compared to 1998 primarily due to an increase in credit card discount fees and computer reservation system fees as a result of higher sales.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Depreciation and amortization expense increased 22.4%, $66 million, in 1999 compared to 1998 primarily due to the addition of new aircraft and related spare parts. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Passenger servicing expense increased 13.9%, $43 million, in 1999 compared to 1998 primarily due to an increase in food costs caused by an increase in passengers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Other operating expense increased 16.1%, $153 million, in 1999 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increases in aircraft servicing expense and outsourced services.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Interest expense increased 30.9%, $55 million, in 1999 as compared to 1998 due to an increase in long-term debt resulting from the purchase of new aircraft and $200 million of 8% unsecured senior notes issued in December 1998,
partially offset by interest savings of $9 million due to the conversion of the Company's 6-3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes into Class B common stock.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Interest income increased 20.3%, $12 million, in 1999 as compared to 1998 due to higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and due to higher interest rates.</P>

preferred securities of trust, redeemable common stock and common stockholders' equity, a ratio of 2.0 to 1, at December 31, 2000 and 2.1 to 1 at December 31, 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In March 2000, the Company completed an offering of $743 million of pass-through certificates to be used to finance (through either leveraged leases or secured debt financings) the debt portion of the acquisition cost of 21 Boeing
aircraft. All of these aircraft were placed in service in 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In November 2000, the Company completed an offering of $176 million of floating enhanced aircraft trust securities to be used to finance the debt portion of the acquisition cost of four Boeing aircraft.  All of these aircraft were
placed in service by January 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In November 2000, the Company completed an offering of $841 million of pass-through certificates to be used to finance (through either leveraged leases or secured debt financings) the debt portion of the acquisition cost of 23 new
Boeing aircraft scheduled for delivery from February 2001 to December 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Also in November 2000, the Company completed the placement of 5,000,000 6% Convertible Preferred Securities, known as Term Income Deferrable Equity Securities.  The net proceeds of the private placement totaled $242 million and
were used as part of the purchase price for approximately 6.7 million shares of Class A common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Class A common stock") held by Northwest Airlines Corporation ("Northwest") and an affiliate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Also in November 2000, the Company completed an offering of $177 million special facilities revenue bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.  The bonds will finance the construction of a maintenance facility,
cargo facility, ground service equipment maintenance facility, terminal improvements, and other various projects related to the Company's Global Gateway expansion at Newark.<B> </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In January 2001, the Company obtained a 3-year $200 million pre-delivery payment facility to be used to finance manufacturer progress payments on 156 new Boeing aircraft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During 2000, the Company's Board of Directors increased the size of its common stock repurchase program by the amount of cash proceeds received by the Company for the purchase of common stock by employees and other participants
under the Company's employee stock purchase and stock option plans after January 1, 2000.  The program also permits the expenditure of one half of future net income (excluding special gains and charges), plus all the proceeds from the sale of
non-strategic assets, to repurchase common stock. Of the approximately $287 million available in the program as of December 31, 2000, $200 million was used as a part of the purchase price for approximately 6.7 million shares of Class A common stock held
by Northwest.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A significant amount of Continental's assets are encumbered.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Deferred Tax Assets</U>.  As of December 31, 2000, the Company had deferred tax assets aggregating $677 million, including $366 million related to net operating losses ("NOLs"), and a valuation allowance of $263 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 382") imposes limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an "ownership change".  In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions
increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period.  In the event that an ownership change occurred, utilization of Continental's NOLs would be subject to an annual
limitation under Section 382 determined by multiplying the value of the Company's stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax exempt rate (which was 5.39% for December 2000).  Any unused annual limitation may be carried over
to later years, and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in assets held by the Company at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change.  Under current
conditions, if an ownership change were to occur, Continental's annual NOL utilization would be limited to approximately $174&nbsp;million per year other than through the recognition of future built-in gain transactions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In November 1998, Northwest completed its acquisition of certain equity of the Company previously held by Air Partners, L.P. and its affiliates, together with certain Class A common stock of the Company held by other investors,
totaling 8,661,224 shares of the Class A common stock. On January 22, 2001, Continental repurchased 6,685,279 shares of Continental Class A common stock from Northwest and an affiliate.  In addition, each issued share of Continental Class A common stock
was reclassified into 1.32 shares of Class B common stock in a nontaxable transaction.  The Company does not believe that these transactions resulted in an ownership change for purposes of Section 382.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Purchase Commitments</U>.  Continental has substantial commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft.  As of December 31, 2000, the estimated aggregate cost of the Company's firm commitments
for Boeing aircraft is approximately $4 billion.  Continental currently plans to finance its new Boeing aircraft with a combination of enhanced pass through trust certificates, lease equity and other third-party financing, subject to availability and
market conditions.  As of December 31, 2000, Continental had approximately $890 million in financing arranged for such Boeing deliveries.  Continental also has commitments or letters of intent for backstop financing for approximately 23% of the
anticipated remaining acquisition cost of such Boeing deliveries.  In addition, at December 31, 2000, Continental had firm commitments to purchase 26 spare engines related to the new Boeing aircraft for approximately $158 million, which will be
deliverable through March 2005.  Further financing will be needed to satisfy the Company's capital commitments for other aircraft and aircraft-related expenditures such as engines, spare parts, simulators and related items.  There can be no assurance that
sufficient financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments.  Deliveries of new Boeing aircraft are expected to increase aircraft rental, depreciation and interest costs while generating
cost savings in the areas of maintenance, fuel and pilot training.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of December 31, 2000, the estimated aggregate cost of Express's firm commitments for Embraer regional jets is approximately $3 billion.   Neither Express nor Continental will have any obligation to take any such firm Embraer
aircraft that are not financed by a third party and leased to Continental.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental expects its cash outlays for 2001 capital expenditures, exclusive of fleet plan requirements, to aggregate approximately $326 million, primarily relating to software application and automation infrastructure projects,
aircraft modifications and mandatory maintenance projects, passenger terminal facility improvements and office, maintenance, telecommunications and ground equipment.  Continental's net capital expenditures during 2000 aggregated $203  million, exclusive
of fleet plan requirements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company expects to fund its future capital commitments through internally generated funds together with general Company financings and aircraft financing transactions.  However, there can be no assurance that sufficient
financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Bond Financings</U>.  Continental has entered into agreements with the City of Houston, Texas, the City of Cleveland, Ohio, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, the Department of Transportation of the State of Hawaii,
the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation, and the Harris County (Houston) Industrial Development Corporation to provide funds for constructing, improving and modifying facilities and acquiring equipment which have been or will be leased to
Continental.  In connection therewith, Continental has unconditionally guaranteed the principal and interest on certain bonds totaling approximately $1.6 billion and has entered into long-term leases with the respective authorities under which rental
payments will be sufficient to service the related bonds.  The leases generally have terms ranging from 20 to 30 years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Employees</U>.  In July 2000, the Company completed a three-year program bringing all employees to industry standard wages and also announced and began to implement a phased plan to bring employee benefits to industry standard
levels by 2003.  The plan provides for increases in vacation, paid holidays, increased 401(k) Company matching contributions and additional past service retirement credit for most senior employees.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In March 2000, CMI and the IAM began collective bargaining negotiations to amend the CMI flight attendants' contract (which became amendable in June 2000).  The parties reached a tentative agreement, which was not ratified by the
flight attendants.  Negotiations will resume in early 2001.  The Company continues to believe that mutually acceptable agreements can be reached with such employees, although the ultimate outcome of the negotiations is unknown at this time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The pilots are in the process of considering whether they wish to merge their independent union, IACP, into the Air Line Pilots Association, which would be subject to ratification by the Continental pilots.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The other employees of Continental, Express and CMI are not covered by collective bargaining agreements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Management believes that the Company's costs are likely to be affected in the future by (i)&nbsp;higher aircraft ownership costs as new aircraft are delivered, (ii)&nbsp;higher wages, salaries, benefits and related costs as the
Company compensates its employees comparable to industry average, (iii) changes in the costs of materials and services (in particular, the cost of fuel, which can fluctuate significantly in response to global market conditions), (iv) changes in
distribution costs and structure, (v)&nbsp;changes in governmental regulations and taxes affecting air transportation and the costs charged for airport access, including new security requirements, (vi)&nbsp;changes in the Company's fleet and related
capacity and (vii)&nbsp;the Company's continuing efforts to reduce costs throughout its operations, including reduced maintenance costs for new aircraft, reduced distribution expense from using Continental's electronic ticket product, E-Ticket and the
internet for bookings, and reduced interest expense.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  RISK</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company is subject to certain market risks, including commodity price risk (i.e., aircraft fuel prices), interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price changes related to investments in equity and debt securities.  The
adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below.  The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions
management may take to mitigate the Company's exposure to such changes.  Actual results may differ.  See the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Company's accounting policies and other information related to these
financial instruments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Aircraft Fuel</U>.  The Company's results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel.  During 2000 and 1999, aircraft fuel accounted for 15.6% and 9.7%, respectively, of the Company's
operating expenses (excluding fleet disposition/impairment losses).  In order to provide short-term protection (generally three to six months) against a sharp increase in jet fuel prices, the Company from time to time enters into petroleum call options,
petroleum swap contracts and jet fuel purchase commitments.  The Company's fuel hedging strategy could result in the Company not fully benefiting from certain fuel price declines.  As of December 31, 2000, the Company had hedged approximately 23% of its
projected 2001 fuel requirements using petroleum call options, which represents 95% of projected first quarter fuel requirements, compared to approximately 24% of its projected 2000 fuel requirements hedged at December 31, 1999.  Subsequent to December
31, 2000, the Company entered into jet fuel and heating oil call options, jet fuel swap contracts and jet fuel purchase commitments.  The Company estimates that a 10% increase in the price per gallon of aircraft fuel would not have a material impact on
the fair value of the petroleum call options existing at December 31, 2000 or 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Foreign Currency</U>.  The Company is exposed to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenue and expenses.  The Company's largest exposure comes from the
Japanese yen.  However, the Company attempts to mitigate the effect of certain potential foreign currency losses by entering into forward contracts that effectively enable it to sell Japanese yen expected to be received from yen-denominated net cash flows
over the next 12 months at specified exchange rates.  As of December 31, 2000, the Company had entered into forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of its 2001 projected yen-denominated net cash flows, as compared to having in place forward contracts
to hedge approximately 95% of its 2000 projected yen-denominated net cash flows at December 31, 1999. The Company estimates that at December 31, 2000, a 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the yen would have increased the fair
value of the existing forward contracts by $15 million as compared to an $18 million increase in the fair value of existing forward contracts at December 31, 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Interest Rates</U>.  The Company's results of operations are affected by fluctuations in interest rates (e.g., interest expense on debt and interest income earned on short-term investments).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company had approximately $754 million and $690 million of variable-rate debt as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The Company has mitigated its exposure on certain variable-rate debt by entering into interest rate
cap and swap agreements.  The interest rate cap had notional amounts of $84 million and $106 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Caps outstanding at December 31, 2000 are effective through July 31, 2001. The interest rate cap limits
the amount of potential increase in the LIBOR rate component of the floating rate to a maximum of 9% over the term of the contract.  The interest rate swap outstanding at December 31, 2000 had a notional amount of $176 million. The interest rate swap
effectively locks the Company into paying a fixed rate of interest on a portion of its floating rate debt securities through 2005.  If average interest rates increased by 100 basis points during 2001 as compared to 2000, the Company's projected 2001
interest expense would increase by approximately $7 million.  At December 31, 1999, an interest rate increase of 100 basis points during 2000 as compared to 1999 was projected to increase 2000 interest expense by approximately $6 million.  The interest
rate cap does not mitigate this increase in interest expense materially given the current level of such floating rates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the fair value of $2.2 billion and $2.2 billion (carrying value) of the Company's fixed-rate debt was estimated to be $2.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, based upon discounted future cash
flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices.  Market risk, estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis points decrease in interest rates, was approximately
$136 million and $91 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The fair value of the remaining fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2000 and 1999, (with a carrying value of $453 million and $248 million, respectively),  was not practicable to
estimate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If 2001 average short-term interest rates decreased by 100 basis points over 2000 average rates, the Company's projected interest income from cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments would decrease by approximately $12
million during 2001, compared to an estimated $11 million decrease during 2000 measured at December 31, 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Investments in Equity Securities</U>.  The Company has a 49% equity investment in Compania Panamena de Aviacion, S.A. ("Copa") and a 28% equity investment in Gulfstream International Airlines, Inc. ("Gulfstream") which are also
subject to price risk.  However, since a readily determinable market value does not exist for either Copa or Gulfstream (each is privately held), the Company is unable to quantify the amount of price risk sensitivity inherent in these investments.  At
December 31, 2000 and 1999, the carrying value of the investment in Copa was $48 million and $49 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the carrying value of the investment in Gulfstream was $8 million and $10 million, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;At December 31, 2000, the Company owned approximately 357,000 depository </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">certificates convertible, subject to certain restrictions, into an equivalent number of shares of the common stock of Equant, which completed an initial public offering in July 1998.  As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the estimated
fair value of these depository certificates was approximately $9 million and $40 million, respectively, based upon the publicly traded market value of Equant common stock.  Since the fair value of the Company's investment in the depository certificates is
not readily determinable (i.e., the depository certificates are not traded on a securities exchange), the investment is carried at cost, which was not material as of December 31, 2000 or 1999.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Continental Airlines, Inc. (the "Company") as of December&nbsp;31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations, common stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2000.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December&nbsp;31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</B>As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 1999, the Company changed its method of accounting for the sale of mileage credits to participating partners in its frequent flyer program.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Air Traffic Liability -</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided rather than when a ticket is sold.  The amount of passenger ticket sales not yet recognized as revenue is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as air
traffic liability.  The Company performs periodic evaluations of this estimated liability, and any adjustments resulting therefrom, which can be significant, are included in results of operations for the periods in which the evaluations are completed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Frequent Flyer Program -</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental sponsors a frequent flyer program, "OnePass", and records an estimated liability for the incremental cost associated with providing the related free transportation at the time a free travel award is earned.  The
liability is adjusted periodically based on awards earned, awards redeemed and changes in the OnePass program.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company also sells mileage credits in the OnePass program to participating partners, such as hotels, car rental agencies and credit card companies.  During 1999, as a result of the issuance of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101
- - "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," the Company changed the method it uses to account for the sale of these mileage credits.  This change, which totaled $27 million, net of tax, was applied retroactively to January 1, 1999.  Under the new
accounting method, revenue from the sale of mileage credits is deferred and recognized when transportation is provided.  Previously, the resulting revenue, net of the incremental cost of providing future air travel, was recorded in the period in which the
credits were sold. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment, including the overhaul of aircraft components, are charged to operating expense as incurred, except engine overhaul costs covered by power by the hour agreements,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Continental has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 - "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") in accounting for its employee stock options and its stock purchase plans because the alternative fair
value accounting provided for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 - "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options or
purchase rights.  Under APB 25, since the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, generally no compensation expense is recognized.  Furthermore, under APB 25, since the
stock purchase plans are considered noncompensatory plans, no compensation expense is recognized.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statement of Position 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities" ("SOP 98-5"), requires start-up costs to be expensed as incurred.  Continental adopted SOP 98-5 in the first quarter of 1999.  This statement requires all
unamortized start up costs (e.g., pilot training costs related to induction of new aircraft) to be expensed upon adoption, resulting in a $6 million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax, in the first quarter of 1999.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Basic earnings per common share ("EPS") excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company.  The following table

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;At December 31, 2000, the Company, including Express, had 386 and 12 aircraft under operating and capital leases, respectively.  These leases have remaining lease terms ranging from one month to 23 years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company's total rental expense for all operating leases, net of sublease rentals, was $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $922 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As part of the Company's risk management program, Continental uses or has used a variety of financial instruments, including petroleum call options, petroleum swap contracts, jet fuel purchase commitments, foreign currency average
rate options, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate cap and swap agreements.  The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Effective October 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 - "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133") and accordingly recognizes all derivatives on the
balance sheet at fair value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notional Amounts and Credit Exposure of Derivatives</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The notional amounts of derivative financial instruments summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged between parties and, therefore, are not a measure of the Company's exposure resulting from its use of derivatives.  The
amounts exchanged are calculated based upon the notional amounts as well as other terms of the instruments, which relate to interest rates, exchange rates or other indices.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fuel Price Risk Management</P>
</U><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</B>The Company uses a combination of petroleum call options, petroleum swap contracts, and jet fuel purchase commitments to provide some short-term protection against a sharp increase in jet fuel prices.  These instruments
generally cover up to 100% of the Company's forecasted jet fuel needs for three to six months.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company accounts for the call options and swap contracts as cash flow hedges.  In accordance with SFAS 133, such financial instruments are recorded at fair value with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
net of applicable income taxes and hedge ineffectiveness, and recognized as a component of fuel expense when the underlying fuel being hedged is used.  The ineffective portion of these call options and swap agreements is determined based on the
correlation between West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil prices and jet fuel prices as well as the change in the time value of the options.  Hedge ineffectiveness is included in fuel expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and was
not material for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.  For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company recognized approximately $44 million and $15 million, respectively, of net losses related to the portion of the hedging
instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (primarily time value). These losses are also included in fuel expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company had petroleum call options outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $329 million and $310 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The fair value of these hedges was not material.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company uses a combination of foreign currency average rate options and forward contracts to hedge against the currency risk associated with its forecasted Japanese yen-denominated net cash flows for the following nine to
twelve months.  The average rate options and forward contracts have only nominal intrinsic value at the time of purchase. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company accounts for these instruments as cash flow hedges.  In accordance with SFAS 133, such financial instruments are recorded at fair value with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable
income taxes and hedge ineffectiveness, and recognized as a component of other revenue when the underlying net cash flows are realized.  The Company measures hedge effectiveness of average rate options and forward contracts based on the forward price of
the underlying currency.  Hedge ineffectiveness was not material during 2000, 1999 or 1998.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;At December 31, 2000, the Company had yen forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $188 million and an unrealized gain of $22 million.  The notional amount of the Company's yen forward contracts
outstanding at December 31, 1999 was $197 million with an unrealized loss of $5 million.  Unrealized gains (losses) are recorded in other current assets (liabilities) with the offset to other accumulated comprehensive income, net of applicable income
taxes and hedge ineffectiveness.  The unrealized loss at December 31, 2000 will be recognized in earnings within the next twelve months.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interest Rate Risk Management</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company entered into interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of potential increases on floating rate debt.  The interest rate cap had a notional amount of $84 million and $106 million as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and is effective through July 31, 2001.  The interest rate swap, which was entered into during 2000, had a notional amount of $176 million at December 31, 2000.  The Company accounts for the interest rate cap and
swap as cash flow hedges whereby the fair value of the interest rate cap and swap is reflected in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset, net of income taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness (which is not material),
recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  The fair value of the interest rate cap and swap was not material as of December 31, 2000 or 1999. Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized as an adjustment to
interest expense over the term of the related hedge.  Such amounts were not material during 2000, 1999 or 1998.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Continental's investment in America West Holdings Corporation ("America West Holdings") was classified as an available-for-sale security and was carried at an aggregate market value of approximately $3 million at December 31, 1999.  In
December 2000, the Company sold its investment in America West Holdings and a right of first refusal, resulting in a gain of $9 million. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In May 1998, the Company acquired a 49% interest in Compania Panamena de Aviacion, S.A. ("Copa") for $53 million.  The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the excess of
the amount at which the investment is carried and the amount of underlying equity in the net assets was $41 million and $40 million, respectively.  This difference is treated as goodwill and is being amortized over 40 years.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On October 20, 1999, Continental sold its interest in AMADEUS Global Travel Distribution, S.A. ("AMADEUS") for $409 million, including a special dividend.  The sale, which occurred as part of AMADEUS's initial public offering, resulted

fair value of the Company's investment in the depository certificates is not readily determinable (i.e., the depository certificates are not traded on a securities exchange), the investment is carried at cost, which was not material as of December 31,
2000 or 1999.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 1999, the Company acquired a 28% interest in Gulfstream International Airlines, Inc. ("Gulfstream").  The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the carrying value
of the investment in Gulfstream was $8 million and $10 million, respectively.  The Company has also guaranteed approximately $25 million of debt for Gulfstream as of December 31, 2000.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The rights become exercisable upon the earlier of (i) the tenth day following a public announcement or public disclosure of facts indicating that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired beneficial
ownership of 15% (20% in the case of an Institutional Investor) or more of the total number of votes entitled to be cast generally by the holders of the common stock of the Company then outstanding, voting together as a single class (such person or group
being an "Acquiring Person"), or (ii) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or announcement of an
intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any person becoming an Acquiring Person.  Certain persons and entities related to the Company, Air Partners or Northwest at the time the Rights Plan was adopted

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If at any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, (i) the Company merges into any other person, (ii) any person merges into the Company and all of the outstanding common stock does not remain outstanding after such merger,
or (iii) the Company sells 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power, each holder of a right (other than the Acquiring Person and its affiliates and associates) will have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof, that number of shares

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;All employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the Company's stock purchase program under which they may purchase shares of Class B common stock of the Company at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first
day of the option period or the last day of the option period.  During 2000 and 1999, 481,950 and 526,729 shares, respectively, of Class B common stock were issued at prices ranging from $27.73 to $38.30 in 2000 and $27.84 to $49.41 in 1999.  During 1998,
305,978 shares of Class B common stock were issued at prices ranging from $29.33 to $49.41.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pro Forma SFAS 123 Results</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and purchase rights under the fair value method of SFAS 123.  The fair value for
these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively:  risk-free interest rates of 6.5%, 4.9% and 4.9%, dividend yields of 0%;
volatility factors of the expected market price of the Company's Class B common stock of 47% for 2000, 43% for 1999 and 40% for 1998, and a weighted-average expected life of the option of 3.6 years, 3.1 years and 3.0 years.  The weighted average grant
date fair value of the stock options granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $17.37, $11.13 and $13.84 per option, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The fair value of the purchase rights under the stock purchase plans was also estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively:  risk free interest rates
of 5.9%, 4.7% and 4.7%; dividend yields of 0%, expected volatility of 47% for 2000, 43% for 1999 and 40% for 1998; and an expected life of .25 years for each of 2000, 1999 and 1998.  The weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted in 2000,
1999 and 1998 was $10.18, $7.72 and $9.10, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  In addition, option valuation models require the input
of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.  Because the Company's employee stock options and purchase rights have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options and purchase rights.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Assuming that the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and purchase rights using the fair value method and amortized the resulting amount to expense over the options' vesting periods, net income would have been
reduced by $20 million, $24 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Basic EPS would have been reduced by 33 cents, 35 cents and 30 cents for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, and diluted EPS would have been reduced by 32 cents, 33 cents and 23 cents for the same periods, respectively.  The pro forma effect on net income is not representative of the pro forma effects on net income in future years because it did
not take into consideration pro forma compensation expense related to grants made prior to 1995.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;At December 31, 2000, the Company had estimated tax net operating losses ("NOLs") of $1 billion for federal income tax purposes that will expire through 2021 and federal investment tax credit carryforwards of $45 million that will
expire through 2001. Due to an ownership change of the Company on April 27, 1993, the ultimate utilization of the Company's NOLs and investment tax credits may be limited.  Reflecting this limitation, the Company had a valuation allowance of $263 million
at December 31, 2000 and 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company has consummated several transactions, which resulted in the recognition of NOLs of the Company's predecessor.  To the extent the Company were to determine in the future that additional NOLs of the Company's predecessor
could be recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, such benefit would reduce the value ascribed to routes, gates and slots.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOTE 12 - ACCRUALS FOR AIRCRAFT RETIREMENTS AND EXCESS FACILITIES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company made the decision to accelerate the retirement of six DC-10-30 aircraft and other items in 1999 and the first half of 2000 and to dispose of related excess inventory. In addition, the
market value of certain Boeing 747 aircraft no longer operated by the Company had declined.  As a result of these items and certain other fleet-related items, the Company recorded a fleet disposition/impairment loss of $81 million in the fourth quarter of
1999.  Approximately $52 million of the $81 million charge related to the impairment of owned or capital leased aircraft and related inventory held for disposal with a carrying amount of $77 million.  The remaining $29 million of the charge related
primarily to costs expected to be incurred related to the return of leased aircraft.  As of December 31, 2000, the remaining accrual for the 1999 fleet disposition/impairment loss totaled $8 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In August 1998, the Company announced that CMI planned to accelerate the retirement of its four Boeing 747 aircraft by April 1999 and its remaining thirteen Boeing 727 aircraft by December 2000. In addition, Express accelerated the
retirement of certain turboprop aircraft to the year 2000, including its fleet of 32 EMB-120 turboprop aircraft, as regional jets are acquired to replace turboprops.  In connection with its decision to accelerate the replacement of these aircraft, the
Company performed evaluations to determine, in accordance with SFAS 121, whether future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate
carrying amount of these aircraft and the related assets.  As a result of the evaluation, management determined that the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these aircraft would be less than their carrying amount, and therefore these
aircraft are impaired as defined by SFAS 121.  Consequently, the original cost basis of these aircraft and related items was reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date the decision was made, resulting in a $59 million fleet dispos
ition/impairment loss.  In determining the fair market value of these assets, the Company considered recent transactions involving sales of similar aircraft and market trends in aircraft dispositions.  The remaining $63 million of the fleet
disposition/impairment loss includes cash and non-cash costs related primarily to future commitments on leased aircraft past the dates they will be removed from service and the write-down of related inventory to its estimated fair market value.  The
combined charge of $122 million was recorded in the third quarter of 1998.  As of December 31, 2000, the remaining accrual for the 1998 fleet disposition/impairment loss totaled $17 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The remaining balance of accruals for aircraft retirements and excess facilities at December 31, 2000 relates to the 1994 accrual for fleet disposition/impairment loss and underutilized facilities of $29 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Significant activity related to these accruals during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were limited to cash payments incurred.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOTE 13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental has substantial commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft.  As of December 31, 2000, Continental had agreed to acquire or lease a total of 86 Boeing jet aircraft through 2005.
The Company anticipates taking delivery of 35 Boeing jet aircraft in 2001.  Continental also has options for an additional 105 aircraft (exercisable subject to certain conditions).  The estimated aggregate cost of the Company's firm commitments for Boeing
aircraft is approximately $4 billion.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental currently plans to finance its new Boeing aircraft with a combination of enhanced pass through trust certificates, lease equity and other third-party financing, subject to availability and market conditions.  As of
December 31, 2000, Continental had approximately $890 million in financing arranged for such Boeing deliveries.  Continental also has commitments or letters of intent for backstop financing for approximately 23% of the anticipated remaining acquisition
cost of future Boeing deliveries.  In addition, at December 31, 2000, Continental has firm commitments to purchase 26 spare engines related to the new Boeing aircraft for approximately $158 million, which will be deliverable through March 2005.  However,
further financing will be needed to satisfy the Company's capital commitments for other aircraft and aircraft-related expenditures such as engines, spare parts, simulators and related items.  There can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be
available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments.  Deliveries of new Boeing aircraft are expected to increase aircraft rental, depreciation and interest costs while generating cost savings in the areas of
maintenance, fuel and pilot training.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of December 31, 2000, Express had firm commitments for 178 Embraer regional jets with options for an additional 100 Embraer regional jets exercisable through 2007.  Express anticipates taking delivery of 41 regional jets in
2001.  The estimated cost of the Company's firm commitments for Embraer regional jets is approximately $3 billion.  Neither Express nor Continental will have any obligation to take any such firm Embraer aircraft that are not financed by a third party and
leased to Continental.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental expects its cash outlays for 2001 capital expenditures, exclusive of fleet plan requirements, to aggregate approximately $326 million, primarily relating to software application and automation infrastructure projects,
aircraft modifications and mandatory maintenance projects, passenger terminal facility improvements and office, maintenance, telecommunications and ground equipment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Continental remains contingently liable until December 1, 2015, on $196 million of long-term lease obligations of US Airways, Inc. ("US Airways") related to the East End Terminal at LaGuardia Airport in New York.  If US Airways
defaulted on these obligations, Continental could be required to cure the default, at which time it would have the right to occupy the terminal.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Approximately 41% of the Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  The Company's collective bargaining agreements with its CMI flight attendants (representing approximately 1% of the Company's employees)
became amendable in June 2000. The parties reached a tentative agreement, which was not ratified by the flight attendants.  Negotiations will resume in early 2001.  The Company continues to believe that mutually acceptable agreements can be reached with
such employees, although the ultimate outcome of the Company's negotiations is unknown at this time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On July 25, 2000, a Concorde aircraft operated by Societe Air France ("Air France") crashed shortly after takeoff from France's Charles de Gaulle Airport, killing 114 people and destroying the aircraft.  The interim investigation
conducted by French authorities suggests that one of the aircraft's tires burst and that portions of the resulting debris struck the underside of a wing of the aircraft which caused the rupture of a fuel tank, leading to a fire and the crash.  In early
September 2000, Continental learned that a small piece of metal found on the runway after the Concorde took off is believed by the French authorities to have caused or contributed to the tire failure and is suspected by investigators to have come from a
Continental DC-10 aircraft that had taken off on the same runway a short time before the Concorde.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Several lawsuits involving Continental have been filed to date in connection with the accident, and Continental anticipates that additional suits will be filed against the Company in the future.  This pending litigation is in
preliminary stages.  Continental is cooperating with French and U.S. authorities in the investigation of the accident.  Although the outcome of these suits or any future litigation cannot be known at this time, Continental's costs to defend these matters
and, the Company believes, any potential liability exposure are covered by insurance.  Consequently, the Company does not expect this litigation or any additional suits that may arise from the accident to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits, including suits relating to certain environmental claims, the Company's consolidated Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code which became effective on April 27, 1993, and proceedings arising in the normal course of business.  While the outcome of these lawsuits and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows, it is the opinion of management, after consulting with counsel, that the ultimate disposition of such suits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The following is a summary of significant related party transactions that occurred during 2000, 1999 and 1998, other than those discussed elsewhere in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In December 2000, the Company sold its remaining investment in America West Holdings, a company in which David Bonderman, a director and stockholder of the Company, holds a significant interest.  The Company and America West
Airlines, Inc. ("America West"), a subsidiary of America West Holdings entered into a series of agreements during 1994 related to code-sharing and ground handling that have created substantial benefits for both airlines. The services provided are
considered normal to the daily operations of both airlines.  As a result of these agreements, Continental paid America West $28 million, $25 million and $20 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and America West paid Continental $33 million, $31
million and $27 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In November 2000, Continental entered into a number of agreements with Northwest and some of its affiliates under which it would repurchase most of its Class A common stock owned by Northwest.  See Note 16.  In November 1998, the
Company and Northwest Airlines, Inc. ("Northwest Airlines"), began implementing a long-term global alliance involving extensive code-sharing, frequent flyer reciprocity and other cooperative activities.  The services provided are considered normal to the
daily operations of both airlines.  As a result of these activities, Continental paid Northwest $10 million in 2000 and $7 million in 1999, respectively, and Northwest paid Continental $14 million in 2000 and $9 million in 1999, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Also in November 2000, Continental entered into an agreement to pay 1992 Air, Inc. $10 million in cash for its sale to Continental of its right of first offer to purchase the shares of Class A common stock that the Company
purchased from Northwest.  1992 Air, Inc. is an affiliate of David Bonderman, one of Continental's directors.  See Note 16.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During December 1999, Continental entered into an equipment sales agreement with Copa for $8 million.  The resulting note receivable is payable in quarterly installments through October 2002.  The services provided are considered
normal to the daily operations of both airlines.  Copa paid Continental $8 million in 2000 and $4 million in 1999, and Continental paid Copa approximately $1 million in each of 2000 and 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In connection with Continental's investment in Gulfstream, Continental purchased from Gulfstream, a ten-year $10 million convertible note, payable in quarterly installments of principal and interest totaling $0.4 million.
Continental also purchased a short-term $3 million secured note, with interest paid quarterly.  During 2000 and 1999, Continental paid Gulfstream $1 million and $1 million, respectively, and Gulfstream paid Continental $16 million and $13 million,
respectively, for services considered normal to the daily operations of both airlines.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Also during December 1999, under a sale and leaseback agreement with Gulfstream, Express sold 25 Beech 1900-D aircraft to Gulfstream in exchange for Gulfstream's assumption of $81 million in debt.  Express is leasing these aircraft
from Gulfstream for periods ranging from eight to 23 months.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On November 15, 2000, Continental entered into a number of agreements with Northwest and some of its affiliates under which it would, among other things, repurchase approximately 6.7 million shares of Class A common stock owned
by Northwest, reclassify all issued shares of Class A common stock into Class B common stock, make other adjustments to its corporate and alliance relationship with Northwest Airlines, and issue to Northwest Airlines one share of preferred stock,
designated as Series B preferred stock ("Series B preferred stock") with blocking rights relating to certain change of control transactions involving Continental and certain matters relating to Continental's rights plan.  The transactions closed on
January 22, 2001.  The consideration paid to repurchase the Class A common stock owned by Northwest and to reclassify the issued Class A common stock to Class B common stock will be accounted for as an equity transaction.  Under the agreements relating to
the recapitalization, Continental and Northwest agreed to seek dismissal of the antitrust litigation brought by the U.S. Department of Justice against Northwest and Continental, which dismissal was granted on January 22, 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Repurchase of Shares of Class A Common Stock</U>.  On January 22, 2001, Continental repurchased from Northwest and an affiliate 6,685,279 shares of Continental Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $450 million
in cash (or approximately $67 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The shares repurchased represented approximately 77% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock owned by Northwest, excluding shares subject to a limited proxy held by Northwest.  This limited proxy terminated upon the
closing of the recapitalization.  After giving effect to the repurchase and the reclassification of the issued shares of Class A common stock into Class B common stock, Northwest's general voting power with respect to Continental, including Northwest's
right to vote certain shares under a limited proxy, was reduced from approximately 59.6% to approximately 7.2%.  This percentage does not include the share of Series B preferred stock issued to Northwest Airlines in the recapitalization, which does not
have general voting rights but instead has a special class vote on certain change of control transactions as described below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Reclassification of Shares of Class A Common Stock</U>.  At the effective time of the recapitalization, the remaining 1,975,945 shares of Class A common stock owned by Northwest that Continental did not purchase, as well as all
other issued shares of Class A common stock, were reclassified into Class B common stock at an exchange rate of 1.32 shares of Class B common stock per share of Class A common stock.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Issuance of Series B Preferred Stock</U>.  In connection with the transactions described above, including the amendment of the master alliance agreement, Continental issued to Northwest Airlines one share of Series B preferred
stock for consideration of $100 in cash.  The Series B preferred stock gives Northwest Airlines the right to vote, as a separate class, during the term of the master alliance agreement or, if earlier, until the Series B preferred stock becomes redeemable,
on:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any amendment to article seven of Continental's certificate of incorporation which relates, in general, to the requirement to obtain the approval of the holder of the Series B preferred stock to amend Continental's rights agreement;
</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>certain business combinations and similar change of control transactions involving Continental and a third party major air carrier with respect to which the stockholders of Continental are entitled to vote;</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any dividend or distribution of all or substantially all of Continental's airline assets; and</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>certain reorganizations and restructuring transactions involving Continental.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Except for the right to vote on any amendment to Continental's certificate of incorporation that would adversely affect the Series B preferred stock, and on any other matter as may be required by law, the Series B preferred stock
does not have any other voting rights. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Purchase of Right of First Offer</U>.  In connection with the recapitalization, Continental paid 1992 Air, Inc. $10 million in cash for its sale to Continental of its right of first offer to purchase the shares of Class A common
stock that the Company purchased from Northwest (which right terminated immediately after the recapitalization).  1992 Air, Inc. is an affiliate of David Bonderman, one of Continental's directors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Standstill Agreement</U>.  In connection with the recapitalization, Northwest and certain of its affiliates have entered into a standstill agreement with the Company that contains standstill and conduct restrictions that are
substantially similar to those previously contained in the corporate governance agreement that had been in place between the parties.  Under the agreement, Northwest agreed to vote neutrally all of Continental's common stock owned by it after the
recapitalization, except that Northwest will be free to vote its shares in its discretion with respect to a change of control of the Company, as defined in the Series B preferred stock certificate of designations, and will vote neutrally or as recommended
by Continental's board of directors with respect to the election of directors.  The standstill agreement provides that Northwest will be released from its obligations if Continental publicly announces that it is seeking, or has entered into an agreement
with, a third party to acquire a majority of Continental's voting securities or all or substantially all of Continental's airline assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Amendment of the Rights Agreement</U>.  Continental has also amended its rights agreement to take into account, among other things, the effects of the recapitalization and to eliminate Northwest's status as an exempt person that
would not trigger the provisions of the rights agreement.</P>

year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount (if any)

Series A Preferred Stock.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
(by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled
immediately prior to such event under the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which
is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;(B)&#9;The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock

of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of
which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the

reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of votes entitled to be cast by the holders of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event
and the denominator of which is the number of votes entitled to be cast by the holders of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Section 1.1</U>&#9;<U>Annual Meeting</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation for the election of Directors and for the transaction of any other proper business shall be held at such time and date in
each year as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time.  The annual meeting in each year shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may be fixed by the Board of Directors, or if not so fixed, at the principal
business office of the Corporation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Section 1.2</U>&#9;<U>Special Meetings</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation, or any other series or class of stock as set forth in the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (as it may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms and applicable law, the "Restated Certificate of Incorporation"), to elect additional Directors under specified circumstances,
special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by (i) stockholders holding Common Stock constituting more than 50% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer or (iii) the Board of Directors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Section 1.3</U>&#9;<U>Place of Meeting</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors may designate the place of meeting for any meeting of the stockholders.  If no designation is made by the Board of Directors, the place of meeting
shall be the principal executive offices of the Corporation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Section 1.4</U>&#9;<U>Notice of Meetings</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, unless notice is waived in writing or by electronic transmission by all stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose for which the meeting is called.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Unless otherwise provided by law, and except as to any stockholder duly waiving notice, the notice of any meeting shall be given personally or by mail or by electronic transmission in the manner provided by law, not less than ten
nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.  If mailed, notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned
meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If, however, the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Section 1.5</U>&#9;<U>Quorum</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided by law, by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws in respect of the vote required for a specified action, at any meeting of
stockholders the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereat, either present or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business, but the stockholders present,
although less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting to another time or place and, except as provided in the last paragraph of <U>Section 1.4</U>, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Section 1.6</U>&#9;<U>Voting</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, whenever Directors are to be elected at a meeting, they shall be elected by a plurality of
the votes cast at the meeting by the holders of stock entitled to vote.  Whenever any corporate action, other than the election of Directors, is to be taken by vote of stockholders at a meeting, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at
the meeting by the holders of stock entitled to vote thereon, except as otherwise required by law, by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Except as otherwise provided by law, or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on any matter at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled
to one vote for each share of such stock standing in the name of such holder on the stock ledger of the Corporation on the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Upon the demand of any stockholder entitled to vote, the vote for Directors or the vote on any other matter at a meeting shall be by written ballot, but otherwise the method of voting and the manner in which votes are counted shall
be discretionary with the presiding officer at the meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Section 1.7</U>&#9;<U>Presiding Officer and Secretary</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;At every meeting of stockholders the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, as designated by the Board of Directors, or, if neither is present,
or in the absence of any such designation, the appointee of the meeting, shall preside.  The Secretary, or in his or her absence an Assistant Secretary, or if none be present, the appointee of the presiding officer of the meeting, shall act as secretary
of the meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Section 1.8</U>&#9;<U>Proxies</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy executed in writing by the stockholder or as

in conformity with regulations prescribed by the Board of Directors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>Section 7.2</U>&#9;<U>Maximum Percentage</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;At no time shall ownership of shares representing more than the Maximum Percentage, as defined below, be registered in the Foreign Stock Record.  As used herein, (a) "<U>
Maximum Percentage</U>" means the maximum percentage of voting power of Voting Stock, as defined below, which may be voted by, or at the direction of, Aliens without violating Foreign Ownership Restrictions or adversely affecting the Corporation's operating certificates or

The order in which Alien Stock shall be registered on the Foreign Stock Record shall be chronological, based on the date the Corporation received a written request to so register such shares of Alien Stock.  If at any time the
Corporation shall find that the combined voting power of Voting Stock then registered in the Foreign Stock Record exceeds the Maximum Percentage, there shall be removed from the Foreign Stock Record the registration of such number of shares so registered
as is sufficient to reduce the combined voting power of the shares so registered to an amount not in excess of the Maximum Percentage.  The order in which such shares shall be removed shall be reverse chronological order based upon the date the
Corporation received a written request to so register such shares of Alien Stock.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Option Term</B>.</U>  Subject to earlier termination as provided herein, the Option shall terminate on ________________________.  The period during which the Option is in effect is referred to as the "Option Period".</LI></P>

Optionee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to Paragraph 15, the Option may be exercised pursuant to a "cashless exercise" arrangement with any brokerage firm approved by the Administrator or its delegate under which arrangement
such brokerage firm, on behalf of Optionee, shall pay to Company the exercise price of the Options being exercised, and Company, pursuant to an irrevocable notice from Optionee, shall promptly after receipt of the exercise price deliver the shares being

under the Option as follows:</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><OL>
<OL TYPE="a">

<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Involuntary Termination for Gross Misconduct.</U>  The Option shall terminate immediately and shall not be exercisable if Optionee's employment (defined below) is terminated involuntarily for gross misconduct (defined below).</LI>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Other Involuntary Termination or Voluntary Termination</U>.  If Optionee's employment is terminated involuntarily other than for gross misconduct or if Optionee voluntarily terminates employment, then immediately (i) the Option
shall terminate as to Shares subject thereto to the extent not yet then vested pursuant to Paragraph 4 or pursuant to Paragraph 6(c) below, and (ii) the Option shall terminate as to all remaining Shares subject thereto to the extent not exercised pursuant
to Paragraph 5 within 30 days after such termination of employment. </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Change in Control</U>.  If a Change in Control shall occur, then immediately the Option shall vest and become exercisable in full; provided, that  if the Change in Control is the result of a business combination with Northwest
or any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with Northwest, the Committee shall determine whether, in connection with such business combination, a change in the composition of the persons with authority to exercise policy-making
functions with respect to the business of the Company has or is reasonably expected to occur, such that the expectations of employees of the Company concerning the direction and management of the Company would be reasonably expected to be materially
affected, and a Change in Control shall be deemed to occur as a result of such business combination only if the Committee determines that such a change has or is reasonably expected to occur.  Notwithstanding any determination by the Committee that such a
change has not or is not reasonably expected to occur, if Optionee's employment with the Company (or any subsidiary which is the principal employer of Optionee) is terminated by the Company (or such subsidiary) at any time during the two year period
following the date of the closing of a business combination with Northwest or any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with Northwest which, but for the determination by the Committee, would constitute a Change in Control, and such
termination of employment by the Company is for any reason other than (I) death, (II) Disability, (III) the willful and continued failure by Optionee substantially to perform his duties and obligations to the Company or such subsidiary (other than any
such failure resulting from a Disability) which failure continues after the date which is 30 days after the Company has given written notice thereof to Optionee which notice specifies the aspects in which  Optionee has failed to perform his duties or
obligations to the Company or such subsidiary and sets forth specific corrective action required of Optionee to be taken within 30 days of the date of giving of the notice, or (IV) the willful engaging by Optionee in misconduct concerning the Company or
such subsidiary, then upon such termination of employment by the Company the Option shall immediately vest and become exercisable in full during the 30 day period following such termination of employment.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Retirement, Death or Disability</U>.  If Optionee's employment is terminated by retirement, death or Disability, then immediately  the Option shall become exercisable in full, whether or not otherwise exercisable, for a term of
one year thereafter by Optionee or, in the case of death, by the person or persons to whom Optionee's rights under the Option shall pass by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, or in the case of Disability, by Optionee's personal
representative.  However, in no event may any Option be exercised by anyone after the earlier of (y) the expiration of the Option Period or (z) one year after Optionee's death, retirement or Disability (described above).</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Definitions</U>.  For purposes of the Option, "employment" means employment by Company or a subsidiary (as the term "subsidiary" is defined in the Plan).  In this regard, neither the transfer of a Participant from employment by
Company to employment by a subsidiary nor the transfer of a Participant from employment by a subsidiary to employment by Company shall be deemed to be a termination of employment of the Participant.  Moreover, the employment of a Participant shall not be
deemed to have been terminated because of absence from active employment on account of temporary illness or during authorized vacation or during temporary leaves of absence from active employment granted by Company or a subsidiary for reasons of
professional advancement, education, health, or government service, or during military leave for any period if the Participant returns to active employment within 90 days after the termination of military leave, or during any period required to be treated
as a leave of absence by virtue of any valid law or agreement.  "Gross misconduct" means such misconduct, dishonesty, wilful and repeated disobedience or other action or inaction as might reasonably be expected to injure Company or any of its subsidiaries
or its or their business interests or reputation.  The Administrator's determination in good faith regarding whether a termination of employment, gross misconduct or Disability has occurred shall be conclusive and determinative.</LI></P></OL>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Reorganization of Company and Subsidiaries</B>.</U>  The existence of the Option shall not affect in any way the right or power of Company or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations,
reorganizations or other changes in Company's capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of Company or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Shares or the rights thereof, or
the dissolution or liquidation of Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Adjustment of Shares</B>.</U>   In the event of stock dividends, spin-offs of assets or other extraordinary dividends, stock splits, combinations of shares, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, reorganizations,
liquidations, issuances of rights or warrants and similar transactions or events involving Company, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the terms and provisions of this Option, in the same manner as is provided for adjustments to the terms and
provisions of the warrants issued by Company to Air Canada and to Air Partners, L.P. under the Warrant Agreement dated as of April 27, 1993.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>No Rights in Shares</B>.</U>  Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder in respect of Shares until such Optionee becomes the holder of record of such Shares.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Certain Restrictions</B>.</U>  By exercising the Option, Optionee agrees that if at the time of such exercise the sale of Shares issued hereunder is not covered by an effective registration statement filed under the
Securities Act of 1933 ("Act"), Optionee will acquire the Shares for Optionee's own account and without a view to resale or distribution in violation of the Act or any other securities law, and upon any such acquisition Optionee will enter into such
written representations, warranties and agreements as Company may reasonably request in order to comply with the Act or any other securities law or with this Option Agreement.  Optionee agrees that Company shall not be obligated to take any affirmative
action in order to cause the issuance or transfer of Shares hereunder to comply with any law, rule or regulation that applies to the Shares subject to the Option.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Shares Reserved</B>.</U>  Company shall at all times during the Option Period reserve and keep available such number of Shares as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Option.</LI></P></OL>
</OL>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.&#9;<B><U>Nontransferability of Option</B>.</U>  The Option granted pursuant to this Option Agreement is not transferable other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or by qualified domestic relations order.  The Option
will be exercisable during Optionee's lifetime only by Optionee or by Optionee's guardian or Personal Representative.  No right or benefit hereunder shall in any manner be liable for or subject to any debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts of Optionee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.&#9;<B><U>Amendment and Termination</B>.</U>  No amendment or termination of the Option which would impair the rights of Optionee shall be made by the Board or the Administrator at any time without the written consent of Optionee.
No amendment or termination of the Plan will adversely affect the rights, privileges and option of Optionee under the Option without the written consent of Optionee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.&#9;<B><U>No Guarantee of Employment</B>.</U>  The Option shall not confer upon Optionee any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with Company or any subsidiary, nor shall it interfere in any way with any

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15.&#9;<B><U>Withholding of Taxes.</B></U>  Company shall have the right to (i) make deductions from any settlement or exercise of an Award made under the Plan, including the delivery of shares, or require shares or cash or both be
withheld from any Award, in each case in an amount sufficient to satisfy withholding of any taxes required by law or (ii) take any other action as may be necessary or appropriate to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">16.&#9;<B><U>No Guarantee of Tax Consequences.</B></U>  Neither Company nor any subsidiary nor the Administrator makes any commitment or guarantee that any federal, state, local or foreign tax treatment will apply or be available to
any person eligible for benefits under the Option.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">17.&#9;<B><U>Severability.</B></U>  In the event that any provision of the Option shall be held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be fully severable, but shall not affect the remaining provisions
of the Option, and the Option shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never been included herein.</P>

constitute an acquired labor right for purposes of any foreign law.  The Plan shall not afford any recipient of an Award any additional right to severance payments or other termination awards or compensation under any foreign law as a result of the

terminate and Company shall release from escrow or trust and shall issue and deliver to Recipient a certificate or certificates for all shares of Restricted Stock; provided, that if the Change in Control is the result of a business combination with
Northwest or any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with Northwest, the Committee shall determine whether, in connection with such business combination, a change in the composition of the persons with authority to exercise
policy-making functions with respect to the business of the Company has or is reasonably expected to occur, such that the expectations of employees of the Company concerning the direction and management of the Company would be reasonably expected to be
materially affected, and a Change in Control shall be deemed to occur as a result of such business combination only if the Committee determines that such a change has or is reasonably expected to occur.  Notwithstanding any determination by the Committee

year period following the date of the closing of a business combination with Northwest or any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with Northwest which, but for the determination by the Committee, would constitute a Change in Control,

than any such failure resulting from a Disability) which failure continues after the date which is 30 days after the Company has given written notice thereof to Recipient which notice specifies the aspects in which Recipient has failed to perform his
duties or obligations to the Company or such subsidiary and sets forth specific corrective action required of Recipient to be taken within 30 days of the date of giving of the notice, or (IV) the willful engaging by Recipient in misconduct concerning the

employment by a subsidiary nor the transfer of Recipient from employment by a subsidiary to employment by Company shall be deemed to be a termination of employment of Recipient.  Moreover, the employment of Recipient shall not be deemed to have been
terminated because of absence from active employment on account of temporary illness or during authorized vacation or during temporary leaves of absence from active employment granted by Company or a subsidiary for reasons of professional advancement,

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Executive Bonus Performance Award Program</P>
</B>
<P>This document constitutes your formal Award Notice as a Participant under the Continental Airlines, Inc. Executive Bonus Performance Award Program (as amended from time to time, the "Executive Bonus Program") adopted under the Continental Airlines,
Inc. Incentive Plan 2000 (as amended from time to time, the "Incentive Plan 2000").  This Award Notice evidences your right to participate in the Executive Bonus Program with respect to the fiscal year of the Company which commences January 1, 2001,
subject to the terms of the Executive Bonus Program and the Incentive Plan 2000.  </P>

<P>The Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") has established a Budget for purposes of the Executive Bonus Program.  The Budget consists of cumulative quarterly net income targets for the fiscal year.  Each
participant in the Executive Bonus Program who remains continuously employed throughout the entire fiscal quarter with respect to which the bonus is to be paid will receive a cash bonus (Quarterly Bonus) equal to the greater of the Net Income Quarterly
Bonus or the EBITDAR Margin Quarterly Bonus for such quarter.</P>

<P>A participant's Net Income Quarterly Bonus for a fiscal quarter is calculated by multiplying the participant's cumulative base salary through such quarter by either (x) 100% plus the percentage positive variance (up to 25%) between the Company's
actual cumulative net income through such quarter and the cumulative net income target with respect to such quarter or (y) 100% less the percentage negative variance between the Company's actual cumulative net income through such quarter and the
cumulative net income target with respect to such quarter, less any Quarterly Bonuses received with respect to prior quarters in the fiscal year.  If the negative variance is greater than 25%, then no Net Income Quarterly Bonus will be paid with respect
to such quarter.</P>

<P>A participant's EBITDAR Margin Quarterly Bonus for a fiscal quarter is calculated by multiplying the participant's cumulative base salary through such quarter by either (x) 125%, if the Company ranks first, second or third when comparing the
cumulative EBITDAR margins through such quarter for all companies in the Industry Group and the Company achieves the operating income hurdle for such quarter or (y) 0%, if the Company fails to achieve the ranking and operating income hurdle referenced in
the prior clause, less any Quarterly Bonuses received with respect to prior quarters in the fiscal year.  The annual operating income hurdle is the same as that established under the Company's Long Term Incentive Performance Award Program (LTIP) for the
relevant period, and the quarterly operating income hurdles are determined as cumulative quarterly percentages of the annual amount as follows:  (1) 19% with respect to the first fiscal quarter; (2) 52.8% with respect to the second fiscal quarter; (3)
83.6% with respect to the third fiscal quarter; and (4) 100% with respect to the fourth fiscal quarter.  The definition of the Industry Group is the same as used in the LTIP program, and EBITDAR and EBITDAR margins are calculated identically as in the
LTIP program for the relevant periods.</P>

<P>Prior to any payment under the Executive Bonus Program, the Committee must certify in writing that the performance goals have been met.</P>

<P>Capitalized terms used in this Award Notice are defined in the Executive Bonus Program, and your participation is subject to the terms of the Executive Bonus Program and the Incentive Plan 2000. The Executive Bonus Program and the Incentive Plan 2000
are hereby incorporated into this Award Notice by reference.</P>

<P>If you have any questions, or wish to obtain a copy of the Executive Bonus Program or the Incentive Plan 2000, please contact _____________.</P>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) with respect to such Awards relating to Follow-up Investments, at any time prior to

Northwest, that a Change in Control shall have been deemed to occur pursuant to the first sentence of Section 5.4 hereof), and (ii) with respect to all other such Awards, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine at the time of the grant of any
such Award that the Base Value of such a Phantom Unit shall be greater than the amount set forth in the preceding sentence, and the Committee shall make each such determination based on such factors and information as it deems relevant.  If the Date of
Grant of an Award is after the date of the acquisition by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Investment to which such Award relates, then the Base Value of the Phantom Unit relating to such Award shall mean the value of such Phantom Unit as of such Date
of Grant as determined by the Committee in such manner as it deems appropriate, and the Committee may consider such factors and information as it deems relevant in making each such determination.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;"Cause" means (i) in the case of a Participant with an employment agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary, the involuntary termination of such Participant's employment by the Company (or, if applicable, a Subsidiary) under
circumstances that do not require the Company (or such Subsidiary) to pay to such Participant a "Termination Payment" or "Monthly Severance Amount," as such terms (or a comparable term) are defined in such Participant's employment agreement, and (ii) in

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(k)&#9;"Disposition" means, with respect to each Investment, a transfer, sale, exchange or other disposition of all or a portion of such Investment by the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, to one or more Transferees.  A
Disposition shall include a Stockholder Disposition.  A Disposition shall not include the exercise of a convertible security (including an option or warrant), but such an exercise shall require an adjustment to related Awards pursuant to Section 4.6.  The
Committee may determine that a transaction involving an exchange of a security for other consideration is not a Disposition (1) to the extent such other consideration consists of securities other than cash or Publicly Traded securities that are Liquid, or

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(n)&#9;"Eligible Employee" means any individual who is an Officer or any other person in an employment relationship with the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation (as defined in Section 424 of the Code).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(q)&#9;"Follow-up Investment" means, with respect to each equity holding in an e-commerce or internet-based business that already constitutes an Investment subject to the Program (an "Existing Investment"), any other equity holding in
or related to such business that is acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary based on the satisfaction of performance targets, vesting provisions, or other terms and conditions set forth in one or more agreements (as the same may be amended from time to
time) to which the Company or a Subsidiary is a party, which agreement(s) were entered into in connection with (and at or around the time the Company or a Subsidiary acquired) the Existing Investment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(r)&#9;"Incentive Plan 2000" means the Continental Airlines, Inc. Incentive Plan 2000, as amended from time to time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(s)&#9;"Investment" means each equity holding of the Company or a Subsidiary in an e-commerce or internet-based business.  Equity holdings in different but affiliated entities shall be considered separate Investments, and different
equity holdings in the same entity shall be considered separate Investments.  The term "Investment" shall include a Follow-up Investment, but each Follow-up Investment shall be considered a new separate Investment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to an equity holding in an e-commerce or internet-based business (other than an equity holding that constitutes a Follow-up Investment) that is acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary after the Effective Date, the Company's Chief Executive Officer
shall provide prompt written notice to the Committee of the acquisition of such equity holding, and such equity holding shall be considered an Investment subject to the Program as of the date of its acquisition unless (i) the Company's Chief Executive
Officer fails to provide such notice to the Committee within 60 days after the date of such acquisition or (ii) the Committee determines (in its sole discretion), within 90 days after the date of such acquisition, that such equity holding shall not be
considered an Investment for purposes of the Program, and delivers written notice thereof within such 90 day period to the Secretary of the Company.   If the Chief Executive Officer fails to give the notice specified in clause (i) of the foregoing
sentence within the time period specified therein, the Committee may nonetheless at any time determine that an equity holding in an e-commerce or internet-based business that is acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary after the Effective Date shall be
considered an Investment for purposes of the Program, provided that any Award (other than an Award with respect to a Follow-up Investment) relating thereto is made by the Committee within 90 days after such determination by the Committee.  With respect to
each equity holding so considered an Investment for purposes of the Program acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary after the Effective Date, the Committee shall determine, within 90 days after the date of such acquisition (or, with respect to an Award
described in the immediately preceding sentence, at the time of the Award), whether a Participant will forfeit 10% of the Redemption Amount upon a redemption of the Award (or any portion thereof) relating to such Investment  pursuant to Section 6.1
hereof.  In connection with the adoption of the Program, the Committee shall designate which Investments acquired prior to the Effective Date by the Company or a Subsidiary shall be subject to the Program as of such date, and whether a Participant will
forfeit 10% of the Redemption Amount upon a redemption of any of the Awards (or any portion thereof) relating to such Investments  pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof. For purposes of Section 2.1(q) and this Section 2.1(s), an "equity holding" means any
interest (including, without limitation, an option or warrant) in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial equity features. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(t)&#9;"Investment Period" means (i) with respect to each Investment (other than a Follow-up Investment), the 10-year period beginning on the first Date of Grant of an Award to any individual with respect to such Investment, and

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(u)&#9;"Liquid" shall mean, with respect to each Investment, a determination by the Committee that (i) the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, could sell all or substantially all of such Investment under Rule 144 promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (or under a similar procedure under foreign law), or otherwise without material transfer restrictions being imposed on a non-affiliate Transferee
as a result thereof, (ii) any such sale is not prohibited by law, regulation, court or administrative order, rule of an exchange or market, contract, or otherwise, (iii) any such sale will not result in liability of the Company or any Subsidiary under
Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (either because of transactions (including Award redemptions) already effected or because of prospective transactions (including Award redemptions) determined by the Committee to be
reasonably probable), and (iv) there is an established public trading market for the securities comprising such Investment which can be used to reasonably determine the Market Value of the Phantom Units relating to such Investment.  An Investment shall
also be considered Liquid if the Committee determines that the Company or a Subsidiary could readily acquire by conversion, exchange, exercise or otherwise one or more securities that satisfy the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence with
respect to all or substantially all of such Investment, and, under such circumstances, the Committee shall make appropriate and equitable adjustments to affected PARs and Awards (including, without limitation, adjustments to the determinations of the Base
Value and Market Value applicable to related Phantom Units) in connection with any redemption thereof under Article VI.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(v)&#9;"Market Value" shall mean, with respect to each Phantom Unit and as of a specified date, the Committee's determination of the value of such Phantom Unit as of such date (with the result rounded to the nearest cent).  Market
Value shall be determined separately with respect to Awards relating to a Phantom Unit that have different Dates of Grant.  Market Value shall be determined by the Committee as follows:</P>

Disposition shall equal the sum of (A) the fair market value of the Distributions allocable to such Phantom Unit that have been received by the Company or a Subsidiary with respect to such Investment from the Date of Grant of the applicable Award to the
date of such Disposition (increased, in the case of any Distribution received in cash, by 7% per annum from the date of receipt of such Distribution by the Company or a Subsidiary to the date of such Disposition) and (B) the fair market value of the net
proceeds to the Company or a Subsidiary with respect to such Disposition that are allocable to such Phantom Unit.  The fair market value determinations required pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made in good faith by the Committee as of the date

the Market Value shall be determined by the Committee.  The Committee's determination shall be made in good faith and shall be based on a valuation opinion prepared by a Valuation Expert who shall be selected by the Committee. The Committee shall cause
the opinion of the Valuation Expert (who shall determine the fair market value of the Investment to which such Phantom Unit relates) to be prepared no later than 60 days after the date as of which the Market Value is being determined.  The Market Value
determined by the Committee based on the opinion of the Valuation Expert shall be increased by the Committee to reflect the fair market value (determined in good faith by the Committee) of the Distributions allocable to such Phantom Unit that have been
received by the Company or a Subsidiary with respect to such Investment from the Date of Grant of the applicable Award to the date of such valuation (increased, in the case of any Distribution received in cash, by 7% per annum from the date of receipt of
such Distribution by the Company or a Subsidiary to the date of such valuation). All costs and expenses of the Valuation Expert shall be borne by the Company.</LI></P></OL>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.1&#9;<U>No Effect on Employment Relationship or SERP</U>.</B>  For all purposes of the Program, a Participant shall be considered to be in the employment of the Company as long as he or she remains employed on a full-time basis by
the Company or any Subsidiary.  Nothing in the adoption of the Program, the grant of Awards, or the payment of amounts under the Program shall confer on any person the right to continued employment by the Company or any Subsidiary or affect in any way the
right of the Company (or a Subsidiary, if applicable) to terminate such employment at any time. Unless otherwise provided in a written employment agreement, the employment of each Participant shall be on an at-will basis, and the employment relationship
may be terminated at any time by either the Participant or the Participant's employer for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.  Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of a Participant's employment for purposes of the
Program, and the reason for such termination, shall be determined solely by and in the discretion of the Committee, and its determination shall be final, binding, and conclusive on all parties.  Any Participant who has a supplemental executive retirement
plan (SERP) with the Company or any Subsidiary understands and agrees, by accepting any Award under the Program, that any Redemption Amount paid with respect to any Award constitutes a <FONT FACE="CG Times (PCL6)">cash bonus paid under a long term incentive plan or program adopted by Company</FONT> and thus shall be excluded from such Participant's cash compensation for purposes of calculating benefits payable under such SERP.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.2&#9;<U>Prohibition Against Assignment or Encumbrance</U>.</B>   No Award, PAR, or other right, title, interest, or benefit hereunder shall ever be assignable or transferable, or liable for, or charged with any of the torts or
obligations of a Participant or any person claiming under a Participant, or be subject to seizure by any creditor of a Participant or any person claiming under a Participant.  No Participant or any person claiming under a Participant shall have the power
to anticipate or dispose of any Award, PAR, or other right, title, interest, or benefit hereunder in any manner until the same shall have actually been distributed free and clear of the terms of the Program. Payments with respect to an Award shall be
payable only to the Participant (or (a) in the event of a Disability that renders such Participant incapable of conducting his or her own affairs, any payment due under the Program to such Participant shall be made to his or her duly appointed legal
representative and (b) in the event of the death of a Participant, any payment due under the Program to such Participant shall be made to his or her estate).  The provisions of the Program shall be binding on all successors and assigns of a Participant,
including without limitation the estate of such Participant and the executor, administrator or trustee of such estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the Participant's creditors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.3&#9;<U>Unfunded, Unsecured Program</U>.</B>  The Program shall constitute an unfunded, unsecured obligation of the Company to make payments of incentive compensation to certain individuals from its general assets in accordance
with the Program.  Each Award and PAR granted under the Program merely constitutes a mechanism for measuring such incentive compensation and does not constitute a property right or interest in the Company, any Subsidiary, or any of their assets
(including, without limitation, any Investment or any Distribution with respect to any Investment). Neither the establishment of the Program, the granting of Awards, nor any other action taken in connection with the Program shall be deemed to (a) create
any interest in an Investment (nor to constitute the direct or indirect sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or other disposition thereof (or of any part thereof) or of any interest therein), (b) create an escrow or trust fund of any kind, (c) create any
fiduciary relationship of the Company or any Subsidiary, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, with respect to any Investment or any Participant, or (d) restrict or affect in any way the acquisition, holding, voting, disposition or the

be construed to give a Participant or anyone claiming under a Participant any right, title, interest, or claim in or to any specific asset, fund, entity, reserve, account, or property of any kind whatsoever owned by the Company or any Subsidiary or in
which the Company or any Subsidiary may have an interest now or in the future; but each Participant shall have the right to enforce any claim hereunder in the same manner as a general creditor.  Neither the establishment of the Program nor participation
hereunder shall create any right in any Participant to make any decision, or provide input with respect to any decision, relating to any Investment or the business of the Company or any Subsidiary.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.5&#9;<U>Tax Withholding</U>.</B>  The Company and the Subsidiaries are hereby directed to deduct and withhold, or cause to be withheld, from a Participant's payment under the Program, or from any other payment to such Participant,
an amount necessary to satisfy any and all tax withholding obligations arising under applicable local, state, federal, or foreign laws associated with such payment.  The Company and the Subsidiaries may take any other action as may in its opinion be
necessary to satisfy all obligations for the payment and withholding of such taxes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.6&#9;<U>No Effect on Other Compensation Arrangements</B></U>.  Nothing contained in the Program or any Participant's Award or Award Notice shall prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from adopting or continuing in effect other or
additional compensation arrangements affecting any Participant.  Nothing in the Program shall be construed to affect the provisions of any other plan or program maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Officer Retention and Incentive Award Program</P>
</B>
<P>This document constitutes your formal Award Notice as a Participant under the Continental Airlines, Inc. Officer Retention and Incentive Award Program (as amended from time to time, the "Retention Program") adopted under the Continental Airlines, Inc.
Incentive Plan 2000 (as amended from time to time, the "Incentive Plan 2000").  This Award Notice evidences your receipt of _________Award[s] under the Retention Program, as follows:</P>

<OL>

<OL>

<LI>An Award of ________ PARs with a Base Value of $_____ per Phantom Unit relating to the Company's Investment in ____________of____________; </LI>

<LI>[An Award of ________ PARs with a Base Value of $______ per Phantom Unit relating to the Company's Investment in ___________of __________.]</LI></OL>
</OL>


<P>Each PAR represents the right to receive the difference, if any, between the Market Value of a Phantom Unit and the Base Value of such Phantom Unit.  A Phantom Unit is the Human Resources Committee's determination of the unit by which to measure
value, price or amount with respect to any Investment and, with respect to the Phantom Units on which your PARs are based, is one-millionth of the Investment.  Your Awards do not create any interest in any of the Investments owned by the Company or a
Subsidiary, which remain the sole property of the Company or the Subsidiary.  Your Awards are instead a right to receive a cash payment measured by a portion of the gain and profits associated with the related Investments. Your Awards are subject to
adjustment in the manner specified in Section 4.6 of the Retention Program.</P>

<P>Your Awards vest at the rate of 6.25% for each full three-month period (commencing on the Date of Grant, which is set forth above) that you remain continuously employed by the Company of a Subsidiary, or as otherwise set forth in the Retention Program.
</P>

<P>Your Awards may be redeemed in any of three circumstances.  First, if the related Investment is Liquid, you may redeem any or all of your related vested PARs by giving notice to the Company (on a form to be prescribed by the Company) during one of
four Window Periods each year, and those PARs will be redeemed by the Company promptly after the end of the applicable Window Period.  Second, if the Company makes a Disposition of the related Investment, you may be entitled to a redemption of some or all
or your related unredeemed PARs.  Payment would be made promptly after the Disposition with respect to vested PARs and promptly after vesting with respect to unvested PARs.  Third, any unredeemed vested PARs will be redeemed promptly after the 10<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the date of grant of the first award to any individual under the Retention Program related to the applicable Investment.  In each case, prior to any redemption, the Human Resources Committee must certify that the related
Performance Goal with respect to the Award was satisfied. All redemptions will be made in cash.</P>

<P>Generally, the Performance Goal with respect to an Award is that (i) the Market Value of a Phantom Unit subject to such Award exceeds the Base Value of such Phantom Unit as of the date as of which a Redemption Amount is determined with respect to such
Award, and (ii) the value of the Investment to which such Award relates and the value of Investments in different equity holdings in the same entity, together with the value of all Follow-up Investments with respect to such Investments, exceeds the
aggregate out-of-pocket cost of such Investments and such Follow-up Investments to the Company and the Subsidiaries paid to the issuer or seller thereof (determined as of the date as of which a Redemption Amount is determined with respect to such Award).  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Participant who is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary on the date a Change in Control occurs shall obtain on such date a 100% Vested Interest in all then outstanding Awards held by such Participant; provided, that if the Change
in Control is the result of a business combination with Northwest Airlines Corporation ("Northwest") or any Person (as defined in the Incentive Plan 2000) controlling, controlled by or under common control with Northwest, then the Committee shall
determine whether, in connection with such business combination, a change in the composition of the persons with authority to exercise policy-making functions with respect to the business of the Company has or is reasonably expected to occur, such that
the expectations of employees of the Company concerning the direction and management of the Company would be reasonably expected to be materially affected, and a Change in Control shall be deemed to occur as a result of such business combination only if
the Committee determines that such a change has or is reasonably expected to occur.  Notwithstanding any determination by the Committee that such a change has not or is not reasonably expected to occur, if a Participant who is employed by the Company or a
Subsidiary on the date of the closing of a business combination with Northwest or any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with Northwest which, but for the determination by the Committee, would constitute a Change in Control, incurs
a Termination of Service at any time during the two-year period following the date of such closing, and such Termination of Service is for any reason other than Cause or the voluntary resignation of such Participant, then such Participant shall obtain on
the date of such Termination of Service a 100% Vested Interest in all then outstanding Awards held by such Participant.</P>

<P>Capitalized terms used in this Award Notice are defined in the Retention Program, and the Awards are subject to the terms of the Retention Program and the Incentive Plan 2000.  The Retention Program and the Incentive Plan 2000 are hereby incorporated
into this Award Notice by reference.</P>

<P>[name and address of director]</P>

<P>Dear [first name]:</P>

<P>At its November 2, 1995 meeting, the Board of Directors of Continental Airlines, Inc. (the "Company"), pursuant to the recommendation of the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors and resolutions duly adopted by the Board, granted certain
lifetime flight benefits to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Company.  At its May 18, 1999 meeting, the Board, pursuant to the recommendation of the Human Resources Committee and resolutions duly adopted by the Board, authorized
the amendment of such flight benefits. The purpose of this letter agreement, as contemplated and authorized by such resolutions, is to set forth the contractual obligations of the parties with respect to such flight benefits.  This letter agreement amends
in its entirety and replaces any prior agreements between you and the Company relating to your flight benefits.</P>

<P>Pursuant to such resolutions, you are hereby granted Flight Benefits for your lifetime.  As used herein, "Flight Benefits" means flight benefits on each airline operated by the Company or any of its affiliates or any successor or successors thereto
(the "CO system"), consisting of the highest priority space available flight passes for you and your eligible family members (as such eligibility is in effect on the date hereof), a Universal Air Travel Plan (UATP) card (or, in the event of discontinuance
of the UATP program, a similar charge card permitting the purchase of air travel through direct billing to the Company or any successor or successors thereto (a "Similar Card")) in your name for charging on an annual basis up to the applicable Annual
Travel Limit (as hereinafter defined) with respect to such year in value (valued identically to the calculation of imputed income resulting from such flight benefits described below) of flights (in any fare class) on the CO system for you, your spouse,
your family and significant others as determined by you, a Platinum Elite OnePass Card (or similar highest category successor frequent flyer card) in your name for use on the CO system,  a membership for you and your spouse in the Company's President's
Club (or any successor program maintained in the CO system) and payment by the Company to you while a member of the Board of Directors of the Company  (and if you shall have five or more years of service on the Board of Directors of the Company, or retire
from the Board after age 70, after your service as a Board member during your lifetime) of an annual amount (not to exceed in any year the applicable Annual Gross Up Limit (as hereinafter defined) with respect to such year) sufficient to pay, on an after
tax basis (i.e., after the payment by you of all taxes on such amount), the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes (or, if you are not subject to U.S. income tax, the national, provincial, local and other income taxes to which you are subject)  on
imputed income resulting from such flights (such imputed income to be calculated during the term of such Flight Benefits at the lowest published fare (i.e., 21 day advance purchase coach fare, lowest negotiated consolidator net fare, or other lowest
available fare) for the applicable itinerary (or similar flights on or around the date of such flight), regardless of the actual fare class booked or flown, or as otherwise required by law) or resulting from any other flight benefits extended to you as a
result of your service as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. </P>

<P>As used herein, with respect to any year, the term "Annual Travel Limit" shall mean an amount (initially $50,000), which amount shall be adjusted (i) annually (beginning with the year 2000) by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the Company's average fare per revenue passenger for its jet operations (excluding regional jets) with respect to the applicable year as reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K (or, if not so reported, as determined by the Company's
independent auditors) (the "Average Fare") for such year, and the denominator of which shall be the Average Fare for the prior year, (ii) annually to add thereto any portion of such amount unused since the year 1999, and (iii) after adjustments described
in clauses (i) and (ii) above, automatically upon any change in the valuation methodology for imputed income from flights (as compared with the valuation methodology for imputed income from flights used by the Company on the date hereof), so as to
preserve the benefit of $50,000 annually (adjusted in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) above) of flights relative to current valuation methodology (e.g., if a change in the valuation methodology results, on average, in such flights being valued 15%
higher than current valuation, then the Annual Travel Limit would be increased by 15% to $57,500, assuming no other adjustments pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above).  In determining any adjustment pursuant to clause (iii) above, the Company shall be
entitled to rely on a good faith calculation performed by its independent auditors based on a statistically significant random sampling of flight valuations compared with the applicable prior valuations of identical flights, which calculation (and the
basis for any adjustments pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above) will be provided to you upon your request.   The Company will promptly notify you in writing of any adjustments to the Annual Travel Limit described in this paragraph.</P>

<P>As used herein, with respect to any year, the term "Annual Gross Up Limit" shall mean an amount (initially $10,000), which amount shall be adjusted (i) annually (beginning with the year 2000) by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the Average Fare for such year, and the denominator of which shall be the Average Fare for the prior year, (ii) annually to add thereto any portion of such amount unused since the year 1999, and (iii) after adjustments described in clauses
(i) and (ii) above, automatically upon any change in the valuation methodology for imputed income from flights (as compared with the valuation methodology for imputed income from flights used by the Company on the date hereof), so as to preserve the
benefit of $10,000 annually (adjusted in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) above) of tax gross up relative to current valuation methodology (e.g., if a change in the valuation methodology results, on average, in flights being valued 15% higher than
current valuation, then the Annual Gross Up Limit would be increased by 15% to $11,500, assuming no other adjustments pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above).  In determining any adjustment pursuant to clause (iii) above, the Company shall be entitled to
rely on a good faith calculation performed by its independent auditors based on a statistically significant random sampling of flight valuations compared with the applicable prior valuations of identical flights, which calculation (and the basis for any
adjustments pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above) will be provided to you upon your request.   The Company will promptly notify you in writing of any adjustments to the Annual Gross Up Limit described in this paragraph.</P>

<P>As used herein, a year may consist of twelve consecutive months other than a calendar year, it being the Company's current practice for purposes of Flight Benefits for a year to commence on December 1 and end on the following November 30 (for example,
the twelve-month period from December 1, 1998 to November 30, 1999 is considered the year 1999 for purposes of Flight Benefits); provided that all calculations for purposes of clause (i) in the prior two paragraphs shall be with respect to fiscal years of
the Company. </P>

<P>As used herein, the term "affiliates" of the Company means any entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with the Company, it being understood that control of an entity shall require the direct or indirect ownership of a majority of
the outstanding capital stock of such entity.</P>

<P>No tickets issued on the CO system in connection with the Flight Benefits may be purchased other than directly from the Company or its successor or successors (i.e., no travel agent or other fee or commission based distributor may be used), nor may
any such tickets be sold or transferred by you or any other person, nor may any such tickets be used by any person other than the person in whose name the ticket is issued.</FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times">  </FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (PCL6)">You agree that, after receipt of an invoice or other accounting statement therefor, you will promptly (and in any event within 45 days after receipt of such invoice or other accounting
statement) reimburse the Company for all charges on your UATP card (or Similar Card) which are not for flights on the CO system and which are not otherwise reimbursable to you under the existing policies of the Company for reimbursement of business
expenses of members of the Board of Directors, or which are for tickets in excess of the applicable Annual Travel Limit.   You agree that the credit availability under your UATP card (or Similar Card) may be suspended if you do not timely reimburse the
Company as described in the foregoing sentence or if you exceed the applicable Annual Travel Limit with respect to a year; provided, that, immediately upon the Company's receipt of your reimbursement in full (or, in the case of exceeding the applicable
Annual Travel Limit, beginning the next following year and after such reimbursement), the credit availability under your UATP card (or Similar Card) will be restored.  </P>

<P>The sole cost to you of flights on the CO system pursuant to use of your Flight Benefits will be the imputed income with respect to flights on the CO system charged on your UATP card (or Similar Card), calculated throughout the term of your Flight
Benefits at the lowest published fare (i.e., 21 day advance purchase coach fare, lowest negotiated consolidator net fare or other lowest available fare) for the applicable itinerary (or similar flights on or around the date of such flight), regardless of
the actual fare class booked or flown, or as otherwise required by law, and reported to you as required by applicable law.   With respect to any period for which the Company is obligated to provide the tax gross up described above, you will provide to the
Company, upon request, a calculation or other evidence of your marginal tax rate sufficient to permit the Company to calculate accurately the amount to be paid to you.</P>

<P>You will be issued a UATP card (or Similar Card), a Platinum Elite OnePass Card (or similar highest category successor frequent flyer card), a membership card in the Company's Presidents Club (or any successor program maintained in the CO system) for
you and your spouse, and an appropriate flight pass identification card, each valid at all times during the term of your Flight Benefits.</P>

<P>This letter agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor of the Company, including without limitation any  person, association, or entity which may hereafter acquire or succeed to all or substantially all
of the business or assets of Company by any means whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise.  This letter agreement and the benefits or obligations hereunder may not be assigned by you.</P>

<P>If you are in agreement with the terms of this letter agreement, please execute the enclosed copy hereof and return it to the Company at the above address, whereupon this letter agreement will become a binding obligation of the parties hereto.</P>

<P>Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>

Agreement supersedes and replaces in its entirety Letter Agreement 1951-3R11 dated September 11, 2000.</P>

<P>All terms used and not defined herein shall have the same meaning as in the Agreement.</P>

<P>In consideration of Buyer's purchase of the Aircraft, Boeing hereby agrees to manufacture and sell up to </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New">[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT] </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">additional Model 737-824 Aircraft (the Option Aircraft) to Buyer, on the same terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, except as otherwise described in Attachment&nbsp;A hereto, and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth below.</P>

<P>&#9;The Option Aircraft will be delivered to Buyer during or before the months set forth in the following schedule:</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&nbsp;</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">
<P>3.&#9;<U>Option Aircraft Deposit</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;In consideration of Boeing's grant to Buyer of options to purchase the Option Aircraft as set forth herein, Buyer has paid a deposit to Boeing of [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New">CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT] </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">for each Option Aircraft (the Option Deposit) prior to the date of this Letter Agreement.  In the event Buyer exercises an option herein for an Option Aircraft, the amount of the Option Deposit for such Option Aircraft will
be credited against the first advance payment due for such Option Aircraft pursuant to the advance payment schedule set forth in Article 5 of the Agreement.  </P>

<P>In the event that Buyer does not exercise its option to purchase a particular Option Aircraft pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Boeing shall be entitled to retain the Option Deposit for such Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>4.&#9;<U>Option Exercise</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;To exercise its option to purchase the Option Aircraft, Buyer shall give written notice thereof to Boeing on or before the first business day of the month in each Option Exercise Date shown below:</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">
<P>5.&#9;<U>Contract Terms</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Within thirty (30) days after Buyer exercises an option to purchase Option Aircraft pursuant to paragraph 4 above, Boeing and Buyer will use their best reasonable efforts to enter into a supplemental agreement amending the Agreement to add the
applicable Option Aircraft to the Agreement as a firm Aircraft (the Option Aircraft Supplemental Agreement).</P>

<P>In the event the parties have not entered into such an Option Aircraft Supplemental Agreement within the time period contemplated herein, either party shall have the right, exercisable by written or telegraphic notice given to the other within ten
(10) days after such period, to cancel the purchase of such Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>6.&#9;<U>Cancellation of Option to Purchase</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Either Boeing or Buyer may cancel the option to purchase an Option Aircraft if any of the following events are not accomplished by the respective dates contemplated in this Letter Agreement, or in the Agreement, as the case may be:</P>

<P>&#9;(i)&#9;purchase of the Aircraft under the Agreement for any reason not attributable to the canceling party;</P>

<P>&#9;(ii)&#9;payment by Buyer of the Option Deposit with respect to such Option Aircraft pursuant to paragraph 3 herein; or</P>

<P>&#9;(iii)&#9;exercise of the option to purchase such Option Aircraft pursuant to the terms hereof.</P>

<P>Any cancellation of an option to purchase by Boeing which is based on the termination of the purchase of an Aircraft under the Agreement shall be on a one-for-one basis, for each Aircraft so terminated.</P>

<P>Cancellation of an option to purchase provided by this letter agreement shall be caused by either party giving written notice to the other within ten (10) days after the respective date in question.  Upon receipt of such notice, all rights and
obligations of the parties with respect to an Option Aircraft for which the option to purchase has been cancelled shall thereupon terminate.</P>

<P>Boeing shall promptly refund to Buyer, without interest, any payments received from Buyer with respect to the affected Option Aircraft.  Boeing shall be entitled to retain the Option Deposit unless cancellation is attributable to Boeing's fault, in
which case the Option Deposit shall also be returned to Buyer without interest.</P>

provisions of the Agreement.</P>

<P>&#9;If Buyer's nonperformance of obligations in this Exhibit or in the BFE Document causes a delay in the delivery of the Aircraft or causes Boeing to perform out-of-sequence or additional work, Buyer will reimburse Boeing for all resulting expenses
and be deemed to have agreed to any such delay in Aircraft delivery.  In addition Boeing will have the right to:</P>

<P>&#9;5.1&#9;provide and install specified equipment or suitable alternate equipment and increase the price of the Aircraft accordingly; and/or</P>

<P>&#9;5.2&#9;deliver the Aircraft to Buyer without the BFE installed.</P>

<P>6.&#9;<U>Return of Equipment</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;BFE not installed in the Aircraft will be returned to Buyer in accordance with Buyer's instructions and at Buyer's expense.</P>

<P>7.&#9;<U>Title and Risk of Loss</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Title to and risk of loss of BFE will at all times remain with Buyer or other owner.  Boeing will have only such liability for BFE as a bailee for mutual benefit would have, but will not be liable for loss of use.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>8.&#9;<U>Indemnification of Boeing</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Buyer hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Boeing from and against all claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incident thereto or incident to successfully establishing the right to indemnification, for
injury to or death of any person or persons, including employees of Buyer but not employees of Boeing, or for loss of or damage to any property, including any Aircraft, arising out of or in any way connected with any nonconformance or defect in any BFE
and whether or not arising in tort or occasioned in whole or in part by the active, passive or imputed negligence of Boeing.  This indemnity will not apply with respect to any nonconformance or defect caused solely by Boeing's installation of the BFE.</P>

<P>9.&#9;<U>Patent Indemnity</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Buyer hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Boeing from and against all claims, suits, actions, liabilities, damages and costs arising out of any actual or alleged infringement of any patent or other intellectual property rights by BFE or arising
out of the installation, sale or use of BFE by Boeing.</P>

<P>10.&#9;<U>Definitions</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;In consideration of Boeing's grant to Buyer of options to purchase the Option Aircraft as set forth herein, Buyer has paid a deposit to Boeing of </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New">[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT]</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"> for each Option Aircraft (the Option Deposit) prior to the date of this Letter Agreement.  In the event Buyer exercises an option herein for an Option Aircraft, the amount of the Option Deposit for such Option Aircraft

<P>In the event that Buyer does not exercise its option to purchase a particular Option Aircraft pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Boeing shall be entitled to retain the Option Deposit for such Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>5.&#9;<U>Contract Terms</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Within thirty (30) days after Buyer exercises an option to purchase Option Aircraft pursuant to paragraph 4 above, Boeing and Buyer will use their best reasonable efforts to enter into a supplemental agreement amending the Agreement to add the
applicable Option Aircraft to the Agreement as a firm Aircraft (the Option Aircraft Supplemental Agreement).</P>

<P>In the event the parties have not entered into such an Option Aircraft Supplemental Agreement within the time period contemplated herein, either party shall have the right, exercisable by written or telegraphic notice given to the other within ten
(10) days after such period, to cancel the purchase of such Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>6.&#9;<U>Cancellation of Option to Purchase</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Either Boeing or Buyer may cancel the option to purchase an Option Aircraft if any of the following events are not accomplished by the respective dates contemplated in this Letter Agreement, or in the Agreement, as the case may be:</P>

<P>&#9;(i)&#9;purchase of the Aircraft under the Agreement for any reason not attributable to the canceling party;</P>

<P>&#9;(ii)&#9;payment by Buyer of the Option Deposit with respect to such Option Aircraft pursuant to paragraph 3 herein; or</P>

<P>&#9;(iii)&#9;exercise of the option to purchase such Option Aircraft pursuant to the terms hereof.</P>

<P>Any cancellation of an option to purchase by Boeing which is based on the termination of the purchase of an Aircraft under the Agreement shall be on a one-for-one basis, for each Aircraft so terminated.</P>

<P>Cancellation of an option to purchase provided by this letter agreement shall be caused by either party giving written notice to the other within ten (10) days after the respective date in question.  Upon receipt of such notice, all rights and
obligations of the parties with respect to an Option Aircraft for which the option to purchase has been cancelled shall thereupon terminate.</P>

<P>Boeing shall promptly refund to Buyer, without interest, any payments received from Buyer with respect to the affected Option Aircraft.  Boeing shall be entitled to retain the Option Deposit unless cancellation is attributable to Boeing's fault, in
which case the Option Deposit shall also be returned to Buyer without interest.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;(2)&#9;Changes mutually agreed upon.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;(3)&#9;Changes required to obtain a Standard Certificate of Airworthiness.</P>

<P>&#9;1.3&#9;<U>Effect of Changes</U>.&#9;Changes to the Detail Specification pursuant to the provisions of the clauses above shall include the effects of such changes upon Option Aircraft weight, balance, design and performance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;This amended and restated Purchase Agreement No. 2061 (formerly known as Purchase Agreement No. 1785) is dated as of October 10, 1997, between The Boeing Company (<B>Boeing</B>) and Continental Airlines, Inc. (<B>Customer</B>)
relating to the purchase and sale of Model 777-200ER aircraft. The terms and conditions of the Aircraft General Terms Agreement dated as of October 10, 1997, between the parties, identified as AGTA-CAL (<B>AGTA</B>), are hereby incorporated by reference into this Purchase Agreement.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">RECITALS</P>

<P>A.  Boeing and Customer previously entered into Purchase Agreement No. 1785 dated March 18, 1993, as amended and supplemented.</P>

<P>B.  Boeing and Customer now desire to further amend and restate the terms and conditions of their agreement and to reflect their entire agreement in this amended and restated Purchase Agreement No. 2061 (Purchase Agreement).</P>

<P>C.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Purchase Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties and replaces and supersedes Purchase Agreement No. 1785.</P>

<P>Now therefore, the parties agree as follows:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Article 1.&#9;<U>Quantity, Model and Description</U>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The aircraft to be delivered to Customer will be designated as Model 777-200ER aircraft (the <B>Aircraft</B>).  Boeing will manufacture and sell to Customer Aircraft conforming to the configuration described in Exhibit A, which
is part of this Purchase Agreement, in the quantities listed in Table 1 and Table 2 to the Purchase Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Article 2.&#9;<U>Delivery Schedule</U>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The Aircraft will be delivered to Customer in accordance with the scheduled months of delivery listed in the attached Table 1 and Table 2, which is part of this Purchase Agreement.  Exhibit B, which is part of this Purchase
Agreement, describes certain responsibilities for both Customer and Boeing in order to accomplish the delivery of the Aircraft.</P>

<P>Article 3.&#9;<U>Price</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;3.1&#9;<U>Aircraft Basic Price</U>.  The Aircraft Basic Price is listed in Table 1 and Table 2 and is subject to mutually agreed upon price adjustments and the Escalation Adjustment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;3.2&#9;<U>Advance Payment Base Prices</U>.  The Advance Payment Base Prices for the Aircraft are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 and were calculated utilizing the latest escalation factors available to Boeing on the date of this
Purchase Agreement projected to the month of scheduled delivery.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;3.3&#9;Boeing has not yet established the Aircraft Basic Price for Aircraft scheduled to be delivered after December 31, 2002.  The prices listed in Table 1 and Table 2 for such Aircraft are only to provide Customer with an
estimate of the applicable Advance Payment Base Prices.  Accordingly, the Aircraft Basic Price for such Aircraft will be the sum of the Airframe Price, Optional Features Prices and the Engine Price first published by Boeing for the same model of aircraft
and engines to be delivered after December 31, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>Article 4.&#9;<U>Payment</U>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;4.1&#9;Boeing acknowledges receipt of a deposit in the amount shown in Table 1 and Table 2 for each Aircraft (<B>Deposit</B>).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;4.2&#9;The amounts and payment dates for advance payments to be made by Customer are set forth in the attached Table 1 and Table 2.  Advance payments for each aircraft are due on the first business day of the months listed in
the attached Table 1 and Table 2.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>&#9;&#9;4.3&#9;                    For any Aircraft whose scheduled month of delivery is less than <B><FONT FACE="Courier New">[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT]</B></FONT>from the date of this Purchase Agreement, the total amount of advance payments due for payment upon signing of this Purchase Agreement will include all advance payments which are past due in accordance with the standard advance payment schedule
set forth in Table 1 and Table 2.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;4.4&#9;The Aircraft Price is the total amount Customer will pay to Boeing at the time of delivery of each Aircraft.  Such Aircraft Price will be calculated at time of delivery using then available escalation factors to
calculate the Escalation Adjustment. The invoice amount for an Aircraft will show the Aircraft Price appropriately adjusted to account for previously received advance payments.</P>

<P>Article 5.&#9;<U>Miscellaneous</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;5.1&#9;<U>Buyer Furnished Equipment Variables</U>.  Supplemental Exhibit BFE1, which is part of this Purchase Agreement, contains vendor selection dates, on dock dates and other variables applicable to the Aircraft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;5.2&#9;<U>Customer Support Variables</U>.  Supplemental Exhibit CS1, which is part of this Purchase Agreement,  contains the variable information applicable to information, training services and other things furnished by Boeing
in support of the Aircraft.</P>

<P>(a)&#9;The Aircraft Basic Price of each Aircraft set forth in Table 2 of the Purchase Agreement includes an aggregate price for GE90 engines and all accessories, equipment and parts provided by the engine manufacturer.  The adjustment in Engine price

<P>The Engine Price Adjustment will not be made if it would result in a decrease in the Engine Base Price.</P>

<P>(c)&#9;The values of the Average Hourly Earnings and Producer Price Indices used will be those published as of a date 30 days prior to the scheduled Aircraft delivery to Customer.  Such values will be considered final and no Engine Price Adjustment
will be made after Aircraft delivery for any subsequent changes in published Index values.</P>

<P>(d)&#9;In the event the Engine price escalation provisions are made non-enforceable or otherwise rendered null and void by any agency of the United States Government, or if the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (i) substantially
revises the methodology (in contrast to benchmark adjustments or other corrections of previously published data) or (ii) discontinues publication of any of the data referred to above, General Electric Company (GE) agrees to meet jointly with Boeing and
Customer, (to the extent such parties may lawfully do so,) to jointly select a substitute for the revised or discontinued data; such substitute data to lead in application to the same adjustment result, insofar as possible, as would have been achieved by
continuing the use of the original data as it may have fluctuated had it not been revised or discontinued.  If such Engine price escalation provisions, methodology or data publication are subsequently reinstated, Boeing will make adjustments consistent
with the agreements defined in this Supplemental Exhibit EE2.</P>
<DIR>

<DIR>

<U><P>NOTE</U>:&#9;The factor (CPI divided by the base year index) by which the Engine Base Price is to be multiplied will be expressed as a decimal and rounded to the nearest thousandth.  Any rounding of a number, as required under this Supplemental
Exhibit EE2 with respect to escalation of the Engine price, will be accomplished as follows:  if the first digit of the portion to be dropped from the number to be rounded is five or greater, the preceding digit will be raised to the next higher number.</P>

hereby extends to Customer and Customer hereby accepts the provisions of GE's Warranty as hereinafter set forth, and such Warranty shall apply to all GE90 type Engines (including all Modules and Parts thereof) installed in the Aircraft at the time of

supersede the provisions of paragraphs 1 through 11 below and paragraphs 1 through 11 below shall be of no force or effect and neither Boeing nor GE shall have any obligation arising therefrom.  In consideration for Boeing's extension of the GE Warranty
to Customer, Customer hereby releases and discharges Boeing from any and all claims, obligations and liabilities whatsoever arising out of the purchase or use of such GE90 type Engines and Customer hereby waives, releases and renounces all its rights in
all such claims, obligations and liabilities <B><FONT FACE="Courier New">[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT]</B></FONT>.

<P>Reference:&#9;Purchase Agreement 2211 (the Purchase Agreement) between The Boeing Company (Boeing) and Continental Airlines, Inc. (Customer) relating to Model 767-224ER aircraft (the Aircraft)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>This Letter Agreement amends and supplements the Purchase Agreement.  All terms used but not defined in this Letter Agreement have the same meaning as in the Purchase Agreement.  This Letter Agreement supersedes and replaces in its entirety Letter
Agreement 2211-01R1.</P>

<P>Boeing agrees to manufacture and sell to Customer additional Model 767-224ER aircraft as <B>Option Aircraft</B>.  The delivery months, number of aircraft, Advance Payment Base Price per aircraft and advance payment schedule are listed in the
Attachment to this Letter Agreement (the Attachment).</P>

<P>1.&#9;<U>Aircraft Description and Changes</P>
</U>
<P>1.1 &#9;<U>Aircraft Description</U>:  The Option Aircraft are described by the Detail Specification listed in the Attachment.</P>

<P>(ii) &#9;Changes required to obtain required regulatory certificates; and</P>
<P>(iii) &#9;Changes mutually agreed upon.</P>

<P>2.&#9;<U>Price</P>
</U>
<P>2.1&#9;The pricing elements of the Option Aircraft are listed in the Attachment.</P>

<P>&#9;2.2&#9;<U>Price Adjustments</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;2.2.1&#9;<U>Optional Features</U>.  The Optional Features Prices selected for the Option Aircraft will be adjusted to Boeing's current prices as of the date of execution of the definitive agreement for the Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;2.2.2&#9;<U>Escalation Adjustments</U>.  The Airframe Price and the Optional Features Prices for Option Aircraft delivering before January, 2005, will be escalated on the same basis as the Aircraft, and will be adjusted to Boeing's
then-current escalation provisions as of the date of execution of the definitive agreement for the Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>The engine manufacturer's current escalation provisions, listed in Exhibit Supplement EE1 to the Purchase Agreement have been estimated to the months of scheduled delivery using commercial forecasts to calculate the Advance Payment Base Price listed
in the Attachment to this Letter Agreement.  The engine escalation provisions will be revised if they are changed by the engine manufacturer prior to the signing of a definitive agreement for the Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;2.2.3&#9;<U>Base Price Adjustments</U>.  The Airframe Price and the Engine Price of the Option Aircraft delivering before January, 2005, will be adjusted to Boeing's and the engine manufacturer's then current prices as of the date of execution
of the definitive agreement for the Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;2.2.4&#9;<U>Prices for Long Lead Time Aircraft</U>.  Boeing and the engine manufacturer have not established prices and escalation provisions for Model 767-224ER aircraft and engines for delivery in the year 2005 and after.  When prices and
the pricing bases are established for the Model 767-224ER aircraft delivering in the year 2005 and after, the information listed in the Attachment will be appropriately amended.</P>

<P>3.&#9;<U>Payment</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;3.1&#9;Customer has paid a deposit to Boeing in the amount shown in the Attachment for each Option Aircraft (Deposit), prior to the date of this Letter Agreement.  If Customer exercises an option, the Deposit will be credited against the first
advance payment due.  If Customer does not exercise an option, Boeing will retain the Deposit for that Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;3.2&#9;Following option exercise, advance payments in the amounts and at the times listed in the Attachment will be payable for the Option Aircraft.  The remainder of the Aircraft Price for the Option Aircraft will be paid at the time of delivery.
</P>

<P>4.&#9;<U>Option Exercise</U>.</P>

<P>Customer may exercise an option by giving written notice to Boeing on or before the date </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST
FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT]</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"> months prior to the first business day of the applicable delivery month listed in the Attachment (Option Exercise Date).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>5.&#9;<U>Contract Terms</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Boeing and Customer will use their best efforts to reach a definitive agreement for the purchase of an Option Aircraft, including the terms and conditions contained in this Letter Agreement, in the Purchase Agreement, and other terms and
conditions as may be agreed upon to add the Option Aircraft to the Purchase Agreement as an Aircraft.  In the event the parties have not entered into a definitive agreement within 30 days following option exercise, either party may terminate the purchase
of such Option Aircraft by giving written notice to the other within 5 days. </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;2.1&#9;If the Bureau of Labor Statistics substantially revises the methodology used for the determination of the values to be used to determine the ECI and ICI values (in contrast to benchmark adjustments or other corrections of
previously released values), or for any reason has not released values needed to determine the applicable Airframe Price Adjustment, the parties will, prior to the delivery of any such Aircraft, select a substitute from other Bureau of Labor Statistics
data or similar data reported by non-governmental organizations.  Such substitute will result in the same adjustment, insofar as possible, as would have been calculated utilizing the original values adjusted for fluctuation during the applicable time
period.  However, if within 24 months after delivery of the Aircraft, the Bureau of Labor Statistics should resume releasing values for the months needed to determine the Airframe Price Adjustment, such values will be used to determine any increase or
decrease in the Airframe Price Adjustment for the Aircraft from that determined at the time of delivery of the Aircraft.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;2.2&#9;Notwithstanding Article 2.1 above, if prior to the scheduled delivery month of an Aircraft the Bureau of Labor Statistics changes the base year for determination of the ECI and ICI values as defined above, such re-based

of paragraph 1 of this Supplemental Exhibit&nbsp;AE1.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;2.4&#9;If within 12 months of Aircraft delivery, the published index values are revised due to an acknowledged error by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Airframe Price Adjustment will be re-calculated using the revised index
values (this does not include those values noted as preliminary by the Bureau of Labor Statistics). A credit memorandum or supplemental invoice will be issued for the Airframe Price Adjustment difference. Interest charges will not apply for the period of
original invoice to issuance of credit memorandum or supplemental invoice.</P>

<P>Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>

<P>This Letter Agreement amends and supplements the Purchase Agreement.  All terms used but not defined in this Letter Agreement shall have the same meaning as in the Purchase Agreement.</P>

<U><P>Definition of Terms:</P>
</U>
<B><P>Correction Costs</B>:  Customer's or a third party's direct labor costs and the cost of any material required to correct a Flight Discrepancy where direct labor costs are equal to the warranty labor rate in effect between the parties at the time
such labor is expended.</P>

<B><P>Flight Discrepancy</B>:  A failure or malfunction of an Aircraft, or the accessories, equipment or parts installed on the Aircraft which results from a defect in the Aircraft, Boeing Product, engine or Supplier Product or a nonconformance to the
Detail Specification for the Aircraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The AGTA provides that each aircraft will be test flown prior to delivery for the purpose of demonstrating the functioning of such Aircraft and its equipment to Customer; however, Customer may elect to waive this test flight.  For each test flight
waived, Boeing agrees to provide Customer an amount of jet fuel at delivery that, including the standard fuel entitlement, totals the following amount of fuel:</P>

</TR>
</TABLE>
</P>


<P>Further, Boeing agrees to reimburse Customer for any Correction Costs incurred as a result of the discovery of a Flight Discrepancy during the first flight of the aircraft by Customer following delivery to the extent such Correction Costs are not
covered under a warranty provided by Boeing, the engine manufacturer or any of Boeing's suppliers.</P>

<P>Should a Flight Discrepancy be detected by Customer which requires the return of the Aircraft to Boeing's facilities at Seattle, Washington, so that Boeing may correct such Flight Discrepancy, Boeing and Customer agree that title to and risk of loss
of such Aircraft will remain with Customer.  Any such correction by Boeing shall be at no cost to Customer.  In addition, it is agreed that Boeing will have responsibility for the Aircraft while it is on the ground at Boeing's facilities in Seattle,
Washington, as is chargeable by law to a bailee for mutual benefit, but Boeing shall not be chargeable for loss of use.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To be reimbursed for Correction Costs, Customer shall submit a written itemized statement describing any flight discrepancies and indicating the Correction Cost incurred by Customer for each discrepancy.  This request must be submitted to Boeing's
Contracts Regional Director at Renton, Washington, within ninety (90) days after the first flight by Customer.</P>

<P>&#9;2.2&#9;<U>Price Adjustments</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;2.2.1&#9;<U>Optional Features</U>.  The Optional Features Prices selected for the Option Aircraft will be adjusted to Boeing's current prices as of the date of execution of the definitive agreement for the Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;2.2.2&#9;<U>Escalation Adjustments</U>.  The Airframe Price and the Optional Features Prices for Option Aircraft delivering before January, 2006, will be escalated on the same basis as the Aircraft, and will be adjusted to Boeing's
then-current escalation provisions as of the date of execution of the definitive agreement for the Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>The engine manufacturer's current escalation provisions, listed in Exhibit Supplement EE1 to the Purchase Agreement have been estimated to the months of scheduled delivery using commercial forecasts to calculate the Advance Payment Base Price listed
in the Attachment to this Letter Agreement.  The engine escalation provisions will be revised if they are changed by the engine manufacturer prior to the signing of a definitive agreement for the Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;2.2.3&#9;<U>Base Price Adjustments</U>.  The Airframe Price and the Engine Price of the Option Aircraft delivering before January, 2006, will be adjusted to Boeing's and the engine manufacturer's then current prices as of the date of execution
of the definitive agreement for the Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;2.2.4&#9;<U>Prices for Long Lead Time Aircraft</U>.  Boeing and the engine manufacturer have not established prices and escalation provisions for Model 757-324 aircraft and engines for delivery in the year 2006 and after.  When prices and the
pricing bases are established for the Model 757-324 aircraft delivering in the year 2006 and after, the information listed in the Attachment will be appropriately amended.</P>

<P>3.&#9;<U>Payment</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;3.1&#9;Customer will pay a deposit to Boeing in the amount shown in the Attachment for each Option Aircraft (Option Deposit), on the date of this Letter Agreement.  If Customer exercises an option, the Option Deposit will be credited against the
first advance payment due.  If Customer does not exercise an option, Boeing will retain the Option Deposit for that Option Aircraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;3.2&#9;Following option exercise, advance payments in the amounts and at the times listed in the Attachment will be payable for the Option Aircraft.  The remainder of the Aircraft Price for the Option Aircraft will be paid at the time of delivery.
</P>

<P>4.&#9;<U>Option Exercise</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Customer may exercise an option by giving written notice to Boeing on or before the date <B>[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT]</B>
months prior to the first business day of the applicable delivery month listed in the Attachment (Option Exercise Date).</P>

<P>5.&#9;<U>Contract Terms</U>.</P>

<P>&#9;Boeing and Customer will use their best efforts to reach a definitive agreement for the purchase of an Option Aircraft, including the terms and conditions contained in this Letter Agreement, in the Purchase Agreement, and other terms and
conditions as may be agreed upon to add the Option Aircraft to the Purchase Agreement as an Aircraft.  In the event the parties have not entered into a definitive agreement within 30 days following option exercise, either party may terminate the purchase
of such Option Aircraft by giving written notice to the other within 5 days.   <B>[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT]</P>

<P>Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>

<P>This Letter Agreement is entered into on the date below, and amends and supplements the Purchase Agreement.  All terms used but not defined in this Letter Agreement have the same meaning as in the Purchase Agreement.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;It is understood by the parties that the Aircraft Basic Price of each Aircraft includes an aggregate price for Rolls-Royce Model RB211-535E4-B engines of <B>[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT]</B>, expressed in July 1999 dollars.  Such price may be adjusted by Rolls-Royce to reflect any change incorporated in such engines in order to satisfy any new rules or regulations, or changes or amendments to the existing rules or regulations, issued by
the FAA, or other applicable U.S. Federal Agency, after June 29, 1998 (Engine Modification).</P>

<P>2. &#9;&#9;Within 20 working days after the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Boeing will place a purchase order with Rolls-Royce for the engines to be installed on the Aircraft.  The engine price adjustment specified in paragraph 1 shall not apply
to any engines scheduled for delivery to Boeing less than twenty-four (24) months after the later of:</P>

<P>(i)&#9;the date of such purchase order between Boeing and <BR>
Rolls-Royce, or</P>

<P>(ii)&#9;the date of Rolls-Royce notification to Boeing of such engine price adjustment.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>3.&#9;The parties agree that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the AGTA, if an Engine Modification is incorporated by Rolls-Royce on engines installed on any of the Aircraft:</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(i)&#9;Boeing will adjust the Purchase Price of any such Aircraft by the amount that Rolls-Royce adjusts the price of such engines to Boeing, as provided in paragraph 1 above, and for the cost to accomplish any necessary change, modification or
alteration to the Aircraft (Aircraft Modification) on which the engines are installed;</P>

<P>(ii)&#9;notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 of the Purchase Agreement and Article 7 of the AGTA, the time of delivery of such Aircraft will be extended to reflect any delay attributable to the Engine Modification or Aircraft Modification and
this delay will be deemed an Excusable Delay under the provisions of the Agreement; and</P>

<P>(iii)&#9;Boeing will, if necessary, revise the applicable Aircraft Detail Specification as required to reflect the effects of any Engine Modification or Aircraft Modification.</P>

</U>
<P>To support Flight Crew Training, Boeing agrees to provide normal line maintenance and expendable spare parts at no charge on the Training Aircraft; and, Customer agrees to provide Standby Parts for the Training Aircraft. The Standby Parts list,
including part numbers, exact quantities and on-dock dates, will be established during the provisioning meeting.</P>

<P>If parts other than those discussed above fail on the Training Aircraft during Flight Crew Training, Boeing will attempt to provide Replacement Parts for those failed parts.  If Boeing is unable to provide Replacement Parts, Customer will be
responsible for providing those parts.</P>

<P>2.&#9;<U>Disposition of Removed Parts.</P>
</U>
<P>With respect to Removed Parts, Boeing may with Customer consent:</P>

<P>(i) &#9;repair such Removed Parts, at no charge to Customer, and either retain such parts as Standby Parts or return the Removed Parts to Customer, at Customer expense;</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>(ii) &#9;return the Removed Parts to Customer at Customer's expense; or</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>(iii) &#9;return the Removed Parts to the manufacturer for repair or replacement under such manufacturer's warranty.  Upon Boeing's receipt of the repaired Removed Parts or their replacements, Boeing may retain such Removed Parts or their replacements
as Standby Parts or return such Removed Parts or their replacements to Customer, at Customer's expense.</P>

<P>Any Removed Parts returned to Customer, or replacements, will be accomplished in accordance with any written instructions from Customer received by Boeing prior to such return.</P>

<P>3.&#9;<U>Payment of Replacement Parts.</P>
</U>
<P>Boeing will invoice Customer for Replacement Parts at Boeing's standard price for such part.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4.&#9;<U>Redelivery of Standby Parts.</P>
</U>
<P>Standby Parts not installed in the Training Aircraft will be redelivered to Customer on board the last aircraft used for Flight Crew Training.</P>

<P>5.&#9;<U>Non-performance by Customer.</P>
</U>
<P>If Customer's non-performance of obligations in this Letter Agreement causes a delay in the Flight Crew Training, Customer will be deemed to have agreed to any such delay in Flight Crew Training.  In addition, Boeing will have the right to:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(i) &#9;purchase Standby Parts and invoice Customer for the price of such parts and for any necessary adjustment and calibration of such parts;</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>(ii) &#9;cancel or reschedule the Flight Crew Training; or</P>

<P>(iii)&#9;invoice Customer for any expenses, including but not limited to ground handling expenses, maintenance costs and storage costs, that are directly attributable to the delay in the Flight Crew Training.</P>

For Replacement Parts, title will transfer to Customer at the time such part is installed on the Training Aircraft.</P>

unusable due to the redesign of the Aircraft or of any accessory, equipment or part therefor, (other than a redesign at Customer's request), Boeing will deliver to Customer new and usable Spare Parts in substitution for such obsolete or unusable Spare
Parts and Customer will return the obsolete or unusable Spare Parts to Boeing.  Boeing will credit Customer's account with Boeing with the price paid by Customer for any such obsolete or unusable Spare Part and will invoice Customer for the purchase price
of any such substitute Spare Part delivered to Customer.</P>

<P>&#9;6.2&#9;<U>Delivery of Obsolete Spare Parts and Substitutes Therefor</U>.  Obsolete or unusable Spare Parts returned by Customer pursuant to this Item&nbsp;will be delivered to Boeing at its Seattle Distribution Center, or such other destination as
Boeing may reasonably designate upon confirmation of replacement part if applicable.  Spare Parts substituted for such returned obsolete or unusable Spare Parts will be delivered to Customer at Boeing's Seattle Distribution Center, or such other Boeing
shipping point as Boeing may reasonably designate.  Boeing will pay the freight charges for the shipment from Customer to Boeing of any such obsolete or unusable Spare Part and for the shipment from Boeing to Customer of any such substitute Spare Part.</P>

<P>7.&#9;<U>Repurchase of Provisioning Items</U>.</P>
<STRIKE>
</STRIKE><P>&#9;7.1&#9;<U>Obligation to Repurchase Peculiar Provisioning Items</U>.  During a period commencing 1 year after delivery of the first Aircraft under the Purchase Agreement, and ending 5 years after such delivery, Boeing will, upon receipt of
Customer's written request and subject to the exceptions in Paragraph&nbsp;7.2, <U>Exceptions</U>, repurchase unused and undamaged Provisioning Items which (i) were recommended by Boeing in the Provisioning Data as initial provisioning for the Aircraft, (ii) were purchased by Customer from Boeing, and (iii) are surplus to Customer's
needs.</P>

<P>&#9;7.2&#9;<U>Exceptions</U>.  Boeing will not be obligated under Paragraph&nbsp;7.1, <U>Obligation to Repurchase</U>, to repurchase any of the following:  (i) quantities of Provisioning Items in excess of those quantities recommended by Boeing in the
Provisioning Data for the Aircraft, (ii) QEC kits, bulk material kits, raw material kits, service bulletin kits, standards kits and components thereof (except those components listed separately in the Provisioning Data), (iii) Provisioning Items for which
an order was received by Boeing more than 8 months after delivery of the last Aircraft, (iv) Provisioning Items which have become obsolete or have been replaced by other Provisioning Items as a result of (a) Customer's modification of the Aircraft or (b)
design improvements by Boeing or the supplier (other than Provisioning Items which have become obsolete because of a defect in design if such defect has not been remedied by an offer by Boeing or the supplier to provide no charge retrofit kits or
replacement parts which correct such defect), and (v) Provisioning Items which become excess as a result of a change in Customer's operating parameters, provided to Boeing pursuant to the Initial Provisioning meeting in Paragraph&nbsp;2, which were the
basis of Boeing's initial provisioning recommendations for the Aircraft.</P>

<P>&#9;7.3&#9;<U>Notification and Format</U>.  Customer will notify Boeing, in writing, when Customer desires to return Provisioning Items which Customer's review indicates are eligible for repurchase by Boeing under the provisions of this Repurchase of
Provisioning Items paragraph.  Customer's notification will include a detailed summary, in part number sequence, of the Provisioning Items Customer desires to return.  Such summary will be in the form of listings, tapes, diskettes or other media as may be
mutually agreed between Boeing and Customer, and will include part number, nomenclature, purchase order number, purchase order date and quantity to be returned.  Within 5 business days after receipt of Customer's notification, Boeing will advise Customer,
in writing, when Boeing's review of such summary will be completed, but in no case will the Boeing review be completed more than 30 days after receipt of Customer's notification.</P>

<P>&#9;7.4&#9;<U>Review and Acceptance by Boeing</U>.  Upon completion of Boeing's review of any detailed summary submitted by Customer pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;7.3, Boeing will issue to Customer a Material Return Authorization (MRA) for those
Provisioning Items Boeing agrees are eligible for repurchase in accordance with this Repurchase of Provisioning Items paragraph.  Boeing will advise Customer of the reason that any spare part included in Customer's detailed summary is not eligible for
return.  Boeing's MRA will state the date by which Provisioning Items listed in the MRA must be redelivered to Boeing and Customer will arrange for shipment of such Provisioning Items accordingly.</P>

<P>&#9;7.5&#9;<U>Price and Payment</U>.  The price of each Provisioning Item repurchased by Boeing pursuant to this Repurchase of Provisioning Items paragraph will be an amount equal to 100% of the original invoice price thereof.  In the case of
Provisioning Items manufactured by a supplier which were purchased pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;4, <U>Purchase from Boeing of Spare Parts as Initial Provisioning for the Aircraft</U>, hereof the repurchase price will not include Boeing's 12% handling charge.  Boeing will pay the repurchase price by issuing a credit memorandum in favor of Customer which
may be applied against amounts due Boeing for the purchase of aircraft, Spare Parts, services or data.</P>

<P>&#9;7.6&#9;<U>Delivery of Provisioning Items</U>. Provisioning Items repurchased by Boeing pursuant to this Repurchase of Provisioning Items paragraph will be delivered to Boeing F.O.B. at its Seattle Distribution Center, or such other destination as
Boeing may reasonably designate. <B>[CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT]</P><DIR>
