ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

SkyWest, Inc. (the "Company"), through its wholly owned subsidiary, SkyWest
Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest"), operates the largest independent regional airline in
the United States. SkyWest offers scheduled passenger and air freight service
with nearly 1,000 daily departures to 79 cities in 23 western states and Canada.
SkyWest has been a code-sharing partner with Delta Air Lines, Inc. ("Delta") in
Salt Lake City and United Airlines ("United") in Los Angeles since 1987 and
1997, respectively. In April 1998, SkyWest expanded its United Express Agreement
to provide service as United Express in United's Portland and Seattle/Tacoma
markets and in additional Los Angeles markets, which began in April 1998. In
January 1998, SkyWest expanded its operations to serve as the United Express
carrier in San Francisco, which began in June 1998. Today, SkyWest operates as
the Delta Connection in Salt Lake City and Dallas Fort Worth and as United
Express in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver and in the Pacific Northwest.
SkyWest believes that its success in attracting multiple code-sharing
relationships is attributable to its delivery of high quality customer service
with an all cabin-class fleet. As of February 28, 2002, 69% of SkyWest's
capacity operated under the Delta code and 31% operated under the United code.
With principal hubs located at Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, San Francisco,
Portland, Dallas/Fort Worth and Seattle/Tacoma, SkyWest offers a convenient and
frequent flight schedule designed to maximize connecting and origin-destination
traffic for its major code-sharing partners. As of December 31, 2001, SkyWest
operated a fleet of 80 Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops ("Brasilias") and 45
Canadair Regional Jets ("CRJs").

Multiple code-sharing relationships have enabled SkyWest to reduce reliance on
any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results
through a mix of SkyWest-controlled flying and contract flying. On
SkyWest-controlled flights, SkyWest controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares. On contract
routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories with SkyWest receiving from its major airline partners
negotiated payments per flight departure and incentives related to passenger
volumes and levels of customer service. The Company transitioned all of its
Delta Connection CRJ flights to contract flying October 1, 2001 and transitioned
all of its Delta Connection Brasilia flights to contract flying effective
January 1, 2002. This transition resulted in essentially all SkyWest flights
operating as contract flying as of January 1, 2002. The Company has agreements
to acquire an additional 96 CRJs with options for an additional 119 aircraft.
These aircraft will be allocated between Delta Connection and United Express
operations.

Since being founded in 1972, the Company has experienced significant growth.
During the past five years, consolidated operating revenues have increased at a
compounded annual growth rate of 23.1%, from $262.1 million in 1997 to $601.9
million in 2001. Total passengers carried by SkyWest have increased from
approximately 2,899,000 to approximately 6,230,000 over the same period. In
2001, the Company experienced growth in available seat miles, revenue passenger
miles, passengers carried and load factors. The Company generated net income of
$56.4 million in 2001, $60.9 million in 2000 and $53.9 million in 1999. During
1999, the Company sold the operations of Scenic Airlines, Inc., and recorded a
loss on the sale of $0.4 million net of income taxes. The amount has been
reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated financial
statements. Additionally, during 2000, the Company sold the operations of
National Parks Transportation in order to focus on the core airline business and
continued development of its Delta and United relationships. The improvement
since fiscal 1997 reflects, among other factors, the addition of United as a
code-sharing partner in October 1997.

JOINT MARKETING AND CODE SHARING AGREEMENTS

Since April 1987, SkyWest has operated as the Delta Connection in certain
SkyWest markets pursuant to the terms of a joint marketing and code sharing
agreement with Delta. In July 1990, SkyWest and Delta entered into a revised
Delta Connection Agreement, modified in April 1997 and May 1999, under which
SkyWest coordinates with Delta to facilitate interline connections at the Salt
Lake City International Airport. The primary benefit of this affiliation is the
use of the Delta designation code (DL) in listing flights in the Official
Airline Guide and in the computerized reservation systems used throughout the
industry. SkyWest's code sharing arrangement with Delta allocates to SkyWest, on
certain flights, a portion of the passenger fare on a formula or other basis,
subject to periodic adjustments. This code sharing agreement also provides for
negotiated minimum payments per flight departure and incentives related to
passenger volumes and


                                       3
<PAGE>
levels of customer service, on certain flights. SkyWest also participates in
cooperative advertising and marketing activities with Delta, including Delta's
Frequent Flyer Program, the Delta Meeting Network and Delta Dream Vacations.

The Company believes the arrangement created between SkyWest and Delta is
similar to those which exist between other major and regional airlines. The
Delta Connection Agreement terminates in June 2010, and is subject to earlier
termination in various circumstances, including upon 180 days advance notice by
either party for any or no reason. During the year ended December 31, 2001,
Delta sold its ownership interest in the Company, which consisted of
approximately 6.2 million shares of common stock and represented approximately
11.1% of the Company's outstanding common stock.

In 2000 and 1997, the Company reached separate ten-year agreements with Delta
and United, respectively, to fly routes under contract flying arrangements. The
Company is compensated on a fee-per-departure basis plus incentive payments
based on operational performance. The fee-per-departure and incentive amounts
are negotiated on an annual basis based on projected operating costs. The
agreements with Delta and United contain certain provisions pursuant to which
the parties could terminate the agreement, subject to certain rights of the
other party, if certain performance criteria are not maintained.

MARKETS AND ROUTES

SkyWest's flight schedules are structured to facilitate the connection of its
passengers with flights of Delta and United at the airports it serves. The
following table shows selected information about the cities served by SkyWest as

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

All interstate air carriers, including SkyWest, are subject to regulation by the
Department of Transportation ("DOT"), the Federal Aviation Administration
("FAA") and certain other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by the
DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA requires
operating, air worthiness and other certificates; approval of personnel who may
engage in flight, maintenance or operation activities; record keeping procedures
in accordance with FAA requirements; and FAA approval of flight training and
retraining programs. Generally, governmental agencies enforce their regulations
through, among other mechanisms, certifications, which are necessary for
SkyWest's continued operations, and proceedings, which can result in civil or
criminal penalties or revocation of operating authority. The FAA can also issue
maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other
things, grounding of aircraft, inspection of aircraft, installation of new
safety-related items and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts
that have failed or may fail in the future.

SkyWest believes it is operating in compliance with FAA regulations and holds
all necessary operating and airworthiness certificates and licenses. The Company
incurs substantial costs in maintaining current certifications and otherwise
complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject. SkyWest's
flight operations, maintenance programs, record keeping and training programs
are conducted under FAA approved procedures. SkyWest does not operate at any
airports where landing slots are restricted.

All air carriers are required to comply with federal laws and regulations
pertaining to noise abatement and engine emissions. All air carriers are also
subject to certain provisions of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, because of their extensive use of radio and other communication
facilities. The Company is also subject to certain other federal and state laws
relating to protection of the environment, labor relations and equal employment
opportunity. Management believes that the Company is in compliance in
all-material respects with these laws and regulations.

COMPETITION AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

The airline industry is highly competitive. The Company not only competes with
other regional airlines, some of which are owned by or are operated as code
sharing partners of major airlines, but also faces competition from low-fare
airlines and major airlines on certain routes. The Company is the dominant
regional airline operating out of the Salt Lake City International Airport;
however, Southwest Airlines, a national low-fare airline, also operates out of
the Salt Lake City International Airport, which results in significant price
competition at the Salt Lake City hub. Competition in the Southern California
and Pacific Northwest markets, which the Company serves from its hubs in Los
Angeles, Seattle/Tacoma and Portland, is particularly intense, with a large
number of carriers in these markets. The Company's principal competitor in the
Los Angeles International Airport is American Eagle. The Company's principal
competitor in the Seattle/Tacoma and Portland markets is Horizon Airlines.

The principal competitive factors in the regional airline industry are fare
pricing, customer service, routes served, flight schedules, aircraft types and
code-sharing relationships. Certain of the Company's competitors are larger and
have significantly greater financial resources than the Company. Moreover,
federal deregulation of the industry allows competitors to rapidly enter markets
and to quickly discount and restructure fares. The airline industry is
particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only
nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats.

Generally, the airline industry is highly sensitive to general economic
conditions, in large part due to the discretionary nature of a substantial
percentage of both business and pleasure travel. In the past, many airlines have
reported decreased earnings or substantial losses resulting from periods of
economic recession, heavy fare discounting and other factors. Economic downturns
combined with competitive pressures have contributed to a number of bankruptcies
and liquidations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic
downturns is somewhat mitigated by the Company's fixed-fee arrangements with
respect to certain flights. Nonetheless, the per passenger component in such fee
structures would be affected by an economic downturn. In addition, if the
Company's major airline code-sharing partners experience longer-term declines in
passenger loads or are injured by low ticket prices, high fuel prices or other
factors, they will likely seek to reduce the Company's fixed fees or cancel a
number of flights in order to reduce their costs.

EMPLOYEES

As of March 15, 2002, the Company employed 4,509 full-time equivalent employees
consisting of 1,750 pilots and flight attendants, 1,841 customer service
personnel, 637 mechanics and other maintenance personnel, and 281 administration
and support personnel. The Company's employees are not currently represented by
any union. The Company is aware, however, that collective bargaining group
organization efforts among its employees occur from time to time and management
anticipates that such efforts will continue in the future. During August 1999,
the question of whether or not to join the Airline Pilots Association ("ALPA")
was submitted to the Company's pilots, who voted against joining ALPA by a
narrow margin. Under governing rules, the Company's pilots may again vote on
this issue at any time because one year has passed since the previous vote. If
unionization efforts are successful, the Company may by subjected to risks of
work interruption or stoppage and/or incur additional expenses associated with
union representation of its employees. In connection with the Company's proposed
acquisition of an additional 96 CRJs and related expansion, the Company
anticipates hiring approximately 2,500 additional employees, many of whom may be
represented by a union in their current employment. The Company has never
experienced any work stoppages and considers its relationships with its
employees to be good.

SEASONALITY

As is common in the airline industry, SkyWest's operations are favorably
affected by increased travel, historically occurring in the summer months, and
are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from
November through January and by inclement weather which occasionally results in
cancelled flights, principally during the winter months. However, SkyWest does
expect some mitigation of the historical seasonal trends due to the transition
from some at risk flying to essentially all contract flying effective January 1,
2002.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various forward-looking statements and
information that are based on management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made
by and information currently available to management. When used in this
document, the words "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "expect,"
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such
forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such
expectations will prove to have been correct. Such statements are subject to
certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks
or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected
or expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on the
Company's operating results include, among other things, changes in SkyWest's
code-sharing relationships, fluctuations in the economy and the demand for air
travel, the degree and nature of competition and SkyWest's ability to expand
services in new and existing markets and to maintain profit margins in the face
of pricing pressures.

As of March 15, 2002, SkyWest owned or leased the following types of aircraft:

</TABLE>

SkyWest's aircraft are turboprop and jet aircraft designed to operate more
economically over short-haul routes with lower passenger load factors than
larger jet aircraft. These factors make it economically feasible for SkyWest to
provide high frequency service in markets with relatively low volumes of
passenger traffic. Passenger comfort features of these aircraft


                                       9
<PAGE>
include stand-up headroom, a lavatory, overhead baggage compartments and flight
attendant service. Fiscal year 1995 marked the introduction of the CRJs. SkyWest
currently operates 54 of these aircraft on stage lengths up to 850 miles.

During 2001, SkyWest took delivery of 33 CRJs in connection with the Delta
Connection and United Express expansion. Additionally, as of December 31, 2001
SkyWest had agreed to acquire an additional 96 CRJs and related spare parts
inventory and support equipment at an aggregate cost of approximately $1.9
billion. SkyWest commenced delivery of these aircraft in January 2002 and
deliveries are scheduled to continue through January 2005. Depending on the
state of the aircraft financing market at the time of delivery, management will
determine whether to acquire these aircraft through third party, long-term loans
or lease agreements. SkyWest also has options to acquire 119 additional CRJs at
fixed prices (subject to cost escalations) and the delivery schedules are
exercisable at various dates through April 2008.

GROUND FACILITIES

Employees of SkyWest perform substantially all routine airframe and engine
maintenance and periodic inspection of equipment. Maintenance is performed
primarily at facilities in Palm Springs, California, Salt Lake City, Utah, and
Fresno, California. SkyWest owns a 56,600 square foot maintenance facility in
Palm Springs, California and leases a 90,000 square foot aircraft maintenance
and training facility at the Salt Lake City International Airport. The facility
consists of a 40,000 square foot maintenance hangar and 50,000 square feet of
training and other facilities. The facility was constructed and is owned by the
Salt Lake City Airport Authority. SkyWest is leasing the facility under an
operating lease arrangement over a 36-year term. The Company also leases a
90,000 square foot maintenance hanger and 15,000 square foot office facility in
Fresno, California. SkyWest finished construction on an additional aircraft
maintenance and training facility in Salt Lake City during November 2001. This
facility is 131,300 square feet, consisting of a 58,400 square foot maintenance
hangar and 72,900 square feet of training and office space. In January 2002, the
Company entered into a sale-lease-back agreement with the Salt Lake Airport
Authority. Under the agreement the Company received approximately $18 million in
cash in exchange for the newly constructed facility and entered into a 26 year
operating lease agreement. The sales price was equal to the construction costs
and no gain or loss was recognized.

SkyWest leases ticket counters, check-in and boarding and other facilities in
the passenger terminal areas in the majority of the airports it serves and
staffs these facilities with SkyWest personnel. Delta and United provide ticket
handling and/or ground support services for SkyWest in 52 of the 81 airports
SkyWest serves.

The Company's corporate headquarters are located in a 63,000 square foot
building and a newly constructed 55,000 square foot building in St. George,
Utah. The newly constructed facility is adjacent to the old office building and
includes office space for maintenance management and flight operations including
pilot management, dispatch and flight attendant management. The old office
building is being remodeled to make more efficient use of space and should be
fully operational in June 2002. Both facilities are owned by the Company and
were internally funded with cash generated from operations. Management deems the
Company's current facilities as being suitable and necessary to support existing
operations and believes the Company's facilities will be adequate for the
foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to certain legal actions, which it considers routine to
its business activities. As of December 31, 2001, management believes, after the
consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate outcome of such legal matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of year 2001.

Company's management and is presented for the purpose of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic

opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                       CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

The Company, through SkyWest Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest"), operates a regional
airline offering scheduled passenger service with over 1,000 daily departures to
80 cities in 24 western states and Canada. All of SkyWest's flights are operated
as either Delta Connection or United Express under code-sharing arrangements
with Delta Air Lines, Inc., ("Delta") or United Airlines, Inc. ("United"). Total
operating revenues and passengers carried have grown consistently from 1997
through 2001, at compounded annual growth rates of approximately 23.1% and
21.1%, respectively. In 1997, SkyWest generated approximately 1.5 billion
available seat miles ("ASMs") and had a fleet of fifty 30-seat Embraer EMB-120
Brasilia turboprops ("Brasilias") and ten Canadair Regional Jets ("CRJs") at
year end. As a result of expanding the Company's code-sharing arrangements with
Delta and United and additional aircraft acquisitions, SkyWest generated
approximately 2.8 billion ASMs in 2001 with a fleet of 80 Brasilias and 45 CRJs
at year end.

SkyWest has been a code-sharing partner with Delta in Salt Lake City and United
in Los Angeles since 1987 and 1997, respectively. In April 1998, SkyWest
expanded its United Express Agreement to provide service as United Express in
United's Portland and Seattle/Tacoma markets and in additional Los Angeles
markets which began in April 1998. In January 1998, SkyWest expanded its
operations to serve as the United Express carrier in San Francisco which began
in June 1998. In November 2001, SkyWest expanded its operations to serve as the
Delta Connection carrier in Dallas Ft. Worth. Today, SkyWest operates as the
Delta Connection in Salt Lake City and Dallas Ft. Worth and as United Express in
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver and in the Pacific Northwest. SkyWest
believes that its success in attracting multiple code-sharing relationships is
attributed to its delivery of high quality customer service with an all
cabin-class fleet.

The Company generated net income of $56.4 million in 2001, compared to $60.9
million in 2000, and $53.9 million in 1999. During 1999, the Company sold the
operations of Scenic Airlines, Inc., and recorded a loss on the sale of $0.4
million net of income taxes. The amount has been reflected as Discontinued
Operations in the Company's financial statements. Additionally, during 2000 the
Company sold the operations of National Parks Transportation in order to focus
on the core airline business and continued development of our Delta and United
relationships. The sale resulted in an immaterial gain. Management believes that
the Company's continued success reflects, among other factors, the expansion of
service as a Delta Connection or United Express carrier in the western United
States.

Multiple code-sharing relationships have enabled SkyWest to reduce reliance on
any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results
through a mix of SkyWest-controlled flying and contract flying. On
SkyWest-controlled flights, SkyWest controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares. On contract
routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories with SkyWest receiving from its major airline partners
negotiated payments per flight departure and incentives related to passenger
volumes and levels of customer service. The Company transitioned all of its
Delta Connection CRJ flights to contract flying October 1, 2001 and transitioned
all if its Delta Connection Brasilia flights to contract flying effective
January 1, 2002. This transition resulted in essentially all SkyWest flights
operating as contract flying as of January 1, 2002. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, approximately 55% of SkyWest's capacity was under the Delta
code and 45% was under the United code. The Company has agreements to acquire an
additional 96 CRJs and options for an additional 119 CRJs with deliveries which
begin in January 2002. These aircraft will be allocated between the Company's
Delta Connection and United Express operations.

On September 11, 2001, the FAA grounded all flights to, from, and within the
United States as a result of the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington D.C.,
and Pennsylvania. All airports were closed and did not reopen until September
13, 2001. When flights were permitted to resume, passenger traffic and yields
were significantly lower than prior to the attacks. United reduced its flight
schedule to approximately 80% of the schedule it flew prior to September 11th.
As a result, SkyWest terminated the leases related to seven Brasilias flown
under the United Code. The termination of these leases resulted in a $3.7
million write-off of unamortized engine overhauls. To help compensate airlines
for their losses, the U.S. Government passed the Air Transportation Safety and
System Stabilization Act (the "Act"). Under this Act, management estimates that
the Company will receive up to approximately $12.3 million to help compensate
for losses resulting from the terrorist attacks of which $8.2 million had been
recognized as of December 31, 2001.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Revenue Recognition

Passenger and freight revenues are recognized when service is provided. Under
the Company's contract flying agreements with Delta and United, revenue is
considered earned when the flight is completed. Passenger tickets sold but not
used and the liability to other airlines are recorded as air traffic liability.

In 2000 and 1997, the Company reached separate ten-year agreements with Delta
and United, respectively, to fly routes under contract flying arrangements. The
Company is compensated on a fee-per-departure basis plus incentive payments
based on operational performance. The fee-per-departure and incentive amounts
are negotiated on an annual basis based on projected operating costs.

Management believes that substantially all of the Company's ongoing revenues
will be generated pursuant to the contract flying arrangements with Delta and
United. Revenue could be impacted by changes to the contracts, the annual
contract negotiations and the Company's ability to earn the incentive payments.

Maintenance

The Company operates under an FAA approved continuous inspection and maintenance
program. The Company's maintenance accounting policy is a combination of
expensing certain events as incurred, accruing for certain maintenance events at
rates estimated to be sufficient to cover those events and capitalizing the cost
of certain maintenance events and expensing the capitalized cost over its
estimated useful life (the "deferral method"). The Company uses the deferral
method of accounting for overhauls of Brasilia engines. For the CRJs, through
July 2001 the Company was accruing for the engine repair and overhaul costs on a
per-flight-hour basis. The cost of normal recurring maintenance and any other
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. For leased aircraft, the Company is
subject to lease return provisions that require that a minimum portion of the
"life" of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date. For
Brasilia engine overhauls related to the leased aircraft to be returned, the
Company adjusts the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based
on the respective lease return date.

Effective August 1, 2001, the Company executed a sixteen-year engine services
agreement with GE Engine Services, Inc. ("GE") covering the scheduled and
unscheduled repair of SkyWest's CRJ jet engines operated on 146 CRJs already
delivered or on order for the Delta Connection and United Express operations.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company pays a set dollar amount per
engine hour flown on a monthly basis to GE and GE assumes the responsibility to
repair the engines when required at no additional expense to the Company,
subject to certain exclusions. The Company expenses the amount paid to GE based
on the monthly rates stipulated in the agreement, as engine hours are flown. The
Company's future maintenance expense on CRJ engines covered under the new
agreement may increase based on changes in labor and aircraft parts indexes
subject to escalation caps.

Pursuant to the services agreement, GE agreed to assume the engine maintenance
related to the Company's CRJ fleet at the effective date of the agreement. At
inception of the agreement, the Company's engine overhaul accrual related to CRJ
engines was approximately $5.6 million. This accrual will be amortized to offset
a portion of the expense related to the services agreement.

Impaired Long Lived Assets

The Company has approximately $586 million of long-lived assets as of December
31, 2001, including approximately $386 million of flight equipment and related
fixed assets. In addition to the original cost of these assets, their recorded
value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the Company, including
estimated useful lives and salvage values. The Company reviews its long-lived
assets for impairment at each balance sheet date for events or changes in
circumstances that may indicate the book value of an asset may not be
recoverable. The Company uses an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows
of the related asset or group of assets over the remaining life in measuring
whether the assets are recoverable. The Company assesses the impairment of
long-lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash
flows that are independent of other groups of assets.

<PAGE>
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires companies to
record derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet as assets or
liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in
the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the
derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The key criterion for
hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in
achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows. In June 1999, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which
amends SFAS No. 133 to be effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 138,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities --
an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 138 amends SFAS No. 133 to (a)
exclude from the scope of SFAS No. 133 nonfinancial assets that will be
delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by a company over a
reasonable period in the normal course of business and for which physical
delivery is probable, (b) permit hedging of a benchmark interest rate, (c) allow
hedging of foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities and (d) allow for
limited hedging of net foreign currency exposures. The Company has no derivative
financial and commodity instruments, forward contracts or hedging arrangements
in cash and cash equivalents. The Company adopted these statements for the year
ended December 31, 2001, which did not have a material impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the
purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination. SFAS
No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets
acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS No. 142 provides
that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized, but will
rather be tested at least annually for impairment. The Company adopted SFAS No.
141 and No. 142 on January 1, 2002, which did not have a material impact on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, with
earlier application encouraged. This statement requires entities to record the
fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in
which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity
capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period,
and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation
for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. The adoption
of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which replaces SFAS Statement No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
of, and is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2001. The accounting
model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long-lived
assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 30, Reporting Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, for the disposal of segments of a business.
This statement requires that those long-lived assets be measured at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing
operations or in discontinued operations. Therefore, discontinued operations
will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for
operating loses that have not yet occurred. This statement also broadens the
reporting of discontinued operations. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.

</TABLE>

2001 COMPARED TO 2000

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $56.4 million, or $0.99 per
share on a diluted basis, compared to $60.9 million or $1.16 per share on a
diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2000. The principal reason for the
decrease in net income was due to the disruption of service on September 11,
2001, when the FAA grounded all flights as a result of the terrorist attacks in
New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania and the subsequent decrease in
demand for airline service. Additionally, the Company experienced decreases in
passenger revenues as a result of the weakening economy. However, despite these
factors, consolidated operating revenues increased 15.1% to $601.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001 from $523.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2000.

Passenger revenues, which represented 99.0% of consolidated operating revenues,
increased 15.5% to $596.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from
$516.2 million or 98.7% of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The increase was due primarily to a 35.6% increase in revenue
passenger miles as the Company continued to increase its services with its
code-sharing partners and placed 30 CRJs in service. Seventeen were scheduled
deliveries and 13 were remarketed by the aircraft manufacturer. Twenty-five of
these aircraft were placed in service under the Delta Connection operations and
five were placed in service under the United Express operations. Additionally,
during the year ended December 31, 2001, seven Brasilias were returned to the
lessor early, resulting in a $3.7 million write-off of unamortized engine
overhauls and three Brasilias were returned to the lessor due to normal lease
expirations. All ten Brasilias were flown under the United Express operations.
Revenue per available seat mile decreased 8.6% to 21.2 cents for the year ended
December 31, 2001 from 23.2 cents for the year ended December 31, 2000 primarily
due to an increase in ASMs produced by CRJs and the disruption in service
resulting from the September 11th terrorist attacks.

Passenger load factor increased to 61.1% for the year ended December 31, 2001
from 56.6% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in load factor was
due primarily to the further development of code-sharing relationships with
United and Delta whereby SkyWest is experiencing higher than average load
factors as the Company transitions to CRJs in its new markets. The increase was
also due, in part, to refinements in SkyWest's flight schedules.

Total operating expenses and interest increased 20.6% to $526.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $436.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. As a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, total
operating expenses and interest increased to 87.5% for the year ended December
31, 2001 from 83.5% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The total increase in
operating expenses as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues was
primarily due to the service disruption resulting from the September 11th
terrorist attacks on the US, and increased infrastructure and build-up costs
associated with new aircraft deliveries in connection with SkyWest's planned
expansion.

Airline operating costs per ASM (including interest expense) decreased 3.6% to
18.6 cents for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 19.3 cents for the year
ended December 31, 2000 despite the September 11th events. The primary reason
for the decrease was the increased capacity by CRJs which are less expensive to
operate on an ASM basis than the Brasilias. Additionally, during the year ended
2001, the Company recognized approximately $8.2 million in funds received under
Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act

<PAGE>
which partially offset increased costs caused by the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks. Other factors relating to the change in operating expenses
are discussed below.

Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased as a percentage of airline
operating revenues to 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 26.2% for
the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was principally the result of the
service disruption and the decrease in demand for airline service resulting from
the September 11th events. The average number of full-time equivalent employees
for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 4,726 compared to 4,160 for the year
ended December 31, 2000, an increase of 13.6%. The increase in number of
employees was due in large part, to the addition of personnel required for
SkyWest's current and anticipated expansion. Salaries, wages and employee
benefits per ASM decreased to 5.9 cents for the year ended December 31, 2001
compared to 6.1 cents for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in
costs was due to the increase in stage lengths flown by CRJs that have been
added to SkyWest's fleet and continued operational improvements.

Aircraft costs, including aircraft rent and depreciation, increased as a
percentage of airline operating revenues to 19.6% for the year ended December
31, 2001 from 16.9% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was due
primarily to the early termination and return of seven leased Brasilias flown
under the United code. The termination of these leases resulted in a $3.7
million write-off of unamortized engine overhauls related to the aircraft.
Aircraft costs per ASM increased slightly to 4.2 cents for the year ended
December 31, 2001 from 3.9 cents for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
increase in costs was due to the $3.7 million write-off, a higher mix of new
aircraft within the fleet and build-up costs associated with the delivery of
these new aircraft.

Maintenance expense increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to
9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 8.3% for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The increase was due primarily to airline operating revenues
increasing only 15.5% period-over-period, while ASMs increased 25.7%.
Maintenance expense increased 26.7% period-over-period due to the increase in
ASMs and increased general maintenance costs in connection with the return of
three Brasilias through lease termination. Maintenance expense per ASM remained
constant at 1.9 cents for both periods because the increase in ASMs produced by
the CRJs was offset by the $3.7 million write-off relating to the early
termination of seven Brasilia leases.

Fuel costs decreased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to 12.0% for
the year ended December 31, 2001 from 13.0% for the year ended December 31,
2000. This decrease was primarily due to the average price of fuel decreasing
13.4% per gallon to $1.03 from $1.19. Fuel costs per ASM decreased to 2.6 cents
for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 3.0 cents for the year ended December
31, 2000.

Other expenses, primarily consisting of commissions, landing fees, station
rentals, computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance,
increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to 20.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2001 from 18.6% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
increase was primarily the result of SkyWest aircraft being grounded because of
the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the increase in liability insurance
as a result of the September 11th events. Expenses other than insurance per ASM
remained constant at 4.3 cents for both years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000
due to the change in mix from the thirty-seat Brasilias to the fifty-seat CRJs.

In September 2001, the U.S. Federal Government passed the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act (the "Act"). Under the Act, funds were made
available to compensate air carriers for direct losses suffered as a result of
any Federal ground stop order and incremental losses beginning September 11,
2001, and ending December 31, 2001, resulting from the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks on the United States. Management estimates that the Company
will receive up to approximately $12.3 million under the Act to partially
compensate for losses resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recognized approximately
$8.2 million under the Act as a Contra expense in its consolidated statement of
income.

2000 COMPARED TO 1999

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $60.9 million, or $1.16 per
share on a diluted basis, compared to $53.9 million, or $1.08 per share on a
diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 1999. Consolidated operating
revenues increased 14.9% to $523.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000
from $455.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.

Passenger revenues, which represented 98.7% of consolidated operating revenues,
increased 15.5%, to $516.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2000 from
$446.9 million or 98.2% of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The increase was due primarily to a 9.9% increase in revenue
passenger miles as the Company continued to increase its services with

<PAGE>
its code-sharing partners and took delivery of four CRJs. Two of these aircraft
were placed in service under the Delta Connection operations and two were placed
in service under the United Express operations. Additionally, during the year
ended December 31, 2000, one Brasilia was returned to the lessor due to the
lease expiration. On SkyWest-controlled flights, SkyWest continued its efforts
to maximize revenue by use of a sophisticated revenue management and control
system that utilizes historical booking data and trends to optimize revenue.
Revenue per ASM increased 6.9% to 23.2 cents for the year ended December 31,
2000 from 21.7 cents for the year ended December 31, 1999.

Passenger load factor increased to 56.6% for the year ended December 31, 2000
from 55.3% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in load factor was
due primarily to the further development of code-sharing relationships with
United and Delta whereby SkyWest experienced higher than average load factors in
its new markets. The increase was also due, in part, to refinements in SkyWest's
flight schedules.

Total operating expenses and interest increased 16.3% to $436.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $375.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. As a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, total
operating expenses and interest increased to 83.5% for the year ended December
31, 2000 from 82.5% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The total increase in
operating expenses as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues was
primarily due to build-up costs associated with future aircraft deliveries in
SkyWest's planned expansion.

Airline operating costs per ASM (including interest expense) increased 7.8% to
19.3 cents for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 17.9 cents for the year
ended December 31, 1999. The primary reason for the increase was due to build-up
costs associated with future aircraft deliveries in SkyWest's planned expansion.
Other factors relating to the change in operating expenses are discussed below.

Salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of airline operating
revenues remained constant at 26.2% for both years ended December 31, 2000 and
1999. The average number of full-time equivalent employees for the year ended
December 31, 2000 was 4,160 compared to 3,572 for the year ended December 31,
1999, an increase of 16.5%. The increase in number of personnel was due in large
part, to the addition of personnel required for SkyWest's expansion. Salaries,
wages and employee benefits per ASM increased to 6.1 cents for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from 5.7 cents for the year ended December 31, 1999. The
increase in costs was due primarily to the increase in the number of full-time
employees required for future expansion.

Aircraft costs, including aircraft rent and depreciation, decreased as a
percentage of airline operating revenues to 16.9% for the year ended December
31, 2000 from 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease in cost
is primarily due to operating revenues increasing 15.5% year over year and
aircraft costs increasing only 11.5% year over year. Aircraft costs per ASM
increased to 3.9 cents for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 3.8 cents for
the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in cost is due to a higher mix of
new aircraft within the fleet and build-up costs associated with the delivery of
new aircraft.

Maintenance expense decreased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to
8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 8.9% for the year ended December
31, 1999. The decrease was due to airline operating revenues increasing 15.5%
year over year and maintenance expenses increasing only 7.1% year over year.
Maintenance cost per ASM was 1.9 cents for both years 2000 and 1999.

Fuel costs increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to 13.0% for
the year ended December 31, 2000 from 8.9% for the year ended December 31, 1999.
The increase was due primarily to the average price of fuel increasing 13.3% per
gallon to $1.19 from $1.05. Fuel costs per ASM increased to 3.0 cents for the
year ended December 31, 2000 from 1.9 cents for the year ended December 31, 1999
as a result of the price per gallon increase.

Other expenses, primarily consisting of commissions, landing fees, station
rentals, computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance,
decreased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to 18.6% for the year
ended December 31, 2000 from 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 1999. Other
expenses per available seat mile decreased to 4.3 cents for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from 4.4 cents for the year ended 2000 due to the change in
mix from the thirty-seat Brasilias to the fifty-seat CRJs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company had working capital of $279.2 million and a current ratio of 3.7:1
at December 31, 2001 compared to working capital of $279.7 million and a current
ratio of 4.4:1 at December 31, 2000. The decrease in working capital was
primarily the result of the Company's acquisition of 33 CRJ's and the associated
build-up costs. The other principal sources of funds during calendar 2001 were
$137.9 million generated from operations, $50.1 million of proceeds from the
issuance of long-term debt, $9.9 million from the sale of

<PAGE>
common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, and $0.5 million of proceeds from the sale of property and
equipment. During 2001, the Company invested $113.4 million in flight equipment,
$43.7 million in marketable securities, $35.2 million in buildings, ground
equipment and other assets and $17.4 million in net deposits on aircraft and
rotables. The Company also reduced long-term debt by $10.2 million and paid $4.5
million in cash dividends. These factors resulted in a $26.0 million decrease in
cash and cash equivalents during 2001.

The Company's position in marketable securities, consisting primarily of bonds,
bond funds and commercial paper, increased to $270.5 million at December 31,
2001 compared to $227.4 million at December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2001,
total capital mix was 82.9% equity and 17.1% debt compared to 86.5% equity and
13.5% debt at December 31, 2000.

The Company expended approximately $79.7 million for non-aircraft capital
expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2001. These expenditures
consisted primarily of $34.3 million for buildings and ground equipment, $22.6
million for aircraft engine overhauls, $21.4 million for rotable spares, and
$1.4 million for aircraft improvements.

The Company has available $10.0 million in an unsecured bank line of credit
through December 15, 2002, with interest payable at the bank's base rate less
one-quarter percent, which was a net rate of 4.5% at December 31, 2001. The
Company believes that in the absence of unusual circumstances the working
capital available to the Company will be sufficient to meet its present
requirements, including expansion, capital expenditures, lease payments and debt
service requirements for at least the next 12 months.

SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS

</TABLE>

During the 2001 year, SkyWest took delivery of 33 CRJs in connection with the
Delta Connection and United Express expansion. Additionally, as of December 31,
2001 SkyWest had agreed to acquire an additional 96 CRJs and related spare parts
inventory and support equipment at an aggregate cost of approximately $1.9
billion. SkyWest commenced delivery of these aircraft in July 2000 and
deliveries are scheduled to continue through January 2005. Depending on the
state of the aircraft financing market at the time of delivery, management will
determine whether to acquire these aircraft through third party, long-term loans
or lease agreements. SkyWest also has options to acquire 119 additional CRJs at
fixed prices (subject to cost escalations) and delivery schedules. The options
are exercisable at various dates through April 2008.

The Company has significant long-term lease obligations primarily relating to
its aircraft fleet. These leases are classified as operating leases and
therefore are not reflected as liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance
sheets. At December 31, 2001, the Company leased 104 aircraft with remaining
lease terms ranging from one to 16 years. Future minimum lease payments due
under all long-term operating leases were approximately $1.1 billion at December
31, 2001. At a 7.5% discount factor, the present value of these lease
obligations would be equal to approximately $668.9 million at December 31, 2001.

The Company's long-term debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of
Brasilia and CRJ aircraft. Certain amounts related to the Brasilia aircraft are
supported by continuing subsidy payments through the export support program of
the Federative Republic of Brazil. The subsidy payments reduce the stated
interest rates to an average effective rate of approximately 3.7%, on $22.5
million of the long-term debt, at December 31, 2001. The continuing subsidy
payments are at risk to the Company if the Federative Republic of Brazil does
not meet its obligations under the export support program. While the Company has
no reason to believe, based on information currently available, that the Company
will not continue to receive these subsidy payments from the Federative Republic
of Brazil in the future, there can be no assurance that such a default will not
occur. On the remaining long-term debt related to the Brasilia aircraft of $22.4
million, the lender has assumed the risk of the subsidy payments and the average
effective rate on this debt is

<PAGE>
approximately 3.8% at December 31, 2001. The average effective rate on the debt
related to the CRJ aircraft of $80.9 million was 6.1% at December 31, 2001, and
is not subject to subsidy payments.

SEASONALITY

As is common in the airline industry, SkyWest's operations are favorably
affected by increased travel, historically occurring in the summer months, and
are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from
November through January and by inclement weather which occasionally results in
cancelled flights, principally during the winter months. However, SkyWest does
expect some mitigation of the historical seasonal trends due to an increase in
the portion of its operations in contract flying.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Company may, from time-to-time, make written or oral forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements may appear in documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, in press releases, and in report to
stockholders. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 contains a
safe harbor for forward-looking statements. The Company relies on this safe
harbor in making such disclosures. When used in this document, the words
"anticipate", "estimate", "project", "expect", and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although Management believes
that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are
reasonable, the Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove
to have been correct. Such statements are subject to certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or
uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected
or expected. Among the key factors that have a direct bearing on the Company's
operating results include, among other things, employee relations and labor
costs, changes in SkyWest's contractual arrangements with it major partners,
fluctuations in the economy and the demand for air travel, the degree and nature
of competition and SkyWest's ability to expand services in new and existing
markets and to maintain profit margins in the face of pricing pressures.

<PAGE>
           QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

AIRCRAFT FUEL

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in the price and availability of aircraft
fuel that affect the Company's earnings. The Company's financial statements
reflect both the cost of fuel purchased for SkyWest-controlled flights, as well
as fuel purchased for contract flights which is subject to reimbursement by our
code-sharing partners. During the year ended 2001, the Company limited its
exposure to fuel price increases with respect to approximately 76% of ASMs
produced, due to contractual arrangements with Delta and United. These major
airlines reimburse the Company for the actual cost of fuel on contracted
flights. For illustrative purposes only, we have estimated the impact of market
risk using a hypothetical increase in fuel price per gallon of 10% for the year
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Based on this hypothetical assumption and
after considering the impact of the contractual arrangements, the Company would
have experienced an increase in fuel expense of approximately $2,816,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2001 and $2,636,000 for the year ended December 31,
2000. The Company currently intends to use cash generated by operating
activities to fund any adverse change in the price of fuel. Under contract
flying, the Company is able to pass through all fuel costs to the major
partners, thus mitigating any fuel cost exposure. The Company transitioned
essentially all flying to contract flying January 1, 2002.

INTEREST RATES

The Company's earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the
amounts of variable rate long-term debt and the amount of cash and securities
held. The interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase
the amount of interest expense. However, the Company would also receive higher
amounts of interest income on its cash and securities held at the time. At
December 31, 2001, the Company had variable rate notes representing 12.7% of the
total long-term debt and 22.2% at December 31, 2000. For illustrative purposes
only, the impact of market risk is estimated using a hypothetical increase in
interest rates of one percentage point for both the Company's variable rate
long-term debt and cash and securities. Based on this hypothetical assumption,
the Company would have incurred an additional $193,000 in interest expense and
received $2,868,000 in additional interest income for the year ended December
31, 2001 and an additional $142,000 in interest expense and received $2,262,000
in additional interest income for the year ended December 31, 2000. As a result
of this hypothetical assumption, the Company believes it could fund interest
rate increases on its variable rate long-term debt with the increased amounts of
interest income. Management does not believe the Company has significant
exposure to the changing interest rates on its fixed-rate long-term debt
instruments, which represent 87.3% of the total long-term debt at December 31,
2001 and 77.8% at December 31, 2000.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



(1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company, through SkyWest Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest"), operates a regional
airline offering scheduled passenger service with approximately 1,000 daily
departures to 80 cities in 24 western states and Canada. All SkyWest flights are
operated as either Delta Connection or United Express under code-sharing
arrangements with Delta Air Lines, Inc. ("Delta") or United Airlines, Inc.
("United"). SkyWest operates as the Delta Connection in Salt Lake City and
Dallas Fort Worth and as the United Express carrier in Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Denver and in the Pacific Northwest. Revenues generated in connection
with the code-sharing relationships with Delta and United account for
substantially all of SkyWest's passenger revenue.

Multiple code-sharing relationships have enabled SkyWest to reduce reliance on
any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results
through a mix of SkyWest controlled flying and contract flying. On SkyWest
controlled flights, SkyWest controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat
inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares. On contract
routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories with SkyWest receiving from its major airline partner
negotiated payments per flight departure and incentives related to passenger
volumes and levels of customer service. As of December 31, 2001, approximately
90% of SkyWest's capacity was in contract flying and 10% was in SkyWest
controlled flying. Beginning January 1, 2002, substantially all of SkyWest's
flights will be operated under contract flying arrangements.


CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
SkyWest, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, SkyWest, Scenic Airlines, Inc.
("Scenic"), and National Parks Transportation, Inc. ("NPT"), collectively (the
"Company"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company sold the operations of
National Parks Transportation. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the
Company sold the operations of Scenic (see Note 8).


CHANGE IN YEAR-END

On February 6, 2001, the Board of Directors approved a change of SkyWest's
fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31, effective December 31, 2001. In
connection with this change, the Company elected to recast the prior periods
consolidated financial statements to December 31 to be consistent with the
current year-end.


USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.


<PAGE>
MARKETABLE SECURITIES

The Company's investments in marketable debt and equity securities are deemed by
management to be available for sale and are reported at fair market value with
the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. At the
time of sale, any realized appreciation or depreciation, calculated by the
specific identification method, will be recognized as a component of operating
results. The Company's position in marketable securities as of December 31, 2001
and 2000 is as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE>

The Company has classified all marketable securities as short-term since it has
the intent to maintain a liquid portfolio and the ability to redeem the
securities within the year.


INVENTORIES

Inventories include expendable parts, fuel and supplies and are valued at cost
(FIFO basis) less an allowance for obsolescence based on historical results and
management's expectations of future operations. Expendable inventory parts are
charged to expense as used.


PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their useful
lives to their estimated residual values using the straight-line method as
follows:

             Aircraft and rotable spares                      3 - 18 years
             Buildings and ground equipment                 3 - 39.5 years

CAPITALIZED INTEREST

Interest is capitalized on aircraft purchase deposits and long-term construction
projects and is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset or the
aircraft lease term. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the
Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $5,185,000 and $788,000,
respectively.


MAINTENANCE

The Company operates under an FAA approved continuous inspection and maintenance
program. The Company's maintenance accounting policy is a combination of
expensing certain events as incurred, accruing for certain maintenance events at
rates estimated to be sufficient to cover those events and capitalizing the cost
of certain maintenance events and expensing the capitalized cost over its
estimated useful life (the "deferral method"). The

<PAGE>



Company uses the deferral method of accounting for Brasilia engines. For the
CRJs, through July 2001 the Company was accruing for the engine repair and
overhaul costs on a per flight hour basis. The cost of normal recurring
maintenance and any other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. For leased
aircraft, the Company is subject to lease return provisions that require that a
minimum portion of the "life" of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the
lease return date. For Brasilia engine overhauls related to leased aircraft to
be returned, the Company adjusts the estimated useful lives of the final engine
overhauls based on the respective lease return date.

Effective August 1, 2001, the Company executed a sixteen year engine services
agreement with GE Engine Services, Inc. ("GE") covering the scheduled and
unscheduled repair of SkyWest's CRJ jet engines operated on 146 CRJs already
delivered or on order for the Delta Connection and United Express operations.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company pays a set dollar amount per
engine hour flown on a monthly basis to GE and GE assumes the responsibility to
repair the engines when required at no additional expense to the Company,
subject to certain exclusions. The Company expenses the amount paid to GE based
on the monthly rates stipulated in the agreement, as engine hours are flown. The
Company's future maintenance expense on CRJ engines covered under the new
agreement may increase based on changes in labor and aircraft part indexes
subject to escalation caps.

Pursuant to the services agreement, GE agreed to assume the engine maintenance
related to the Company's CRJ fleet at the effective date of the agreement. At
inception of the agreement, the Company's engine overhaul accrual related to CRJ
engines was approximately $5.6 million. This accrual will be amortized to offset
a portion of the amounts paid under the services agreement.


PASSENGER AND FREIGHT REVENUES

Passenger and freight revenues are recognized when service is provided. Under
the Company's contract flying agreements with Delta and United, revenue is
considered earned when the flight is completed. Passenger tickets sold but not
used and the liability to other airlines are recorded as air traffic liability.

In 2000 and 1997, the Company reached separate ten-year agreements with Delta
and United, respectively, to fly routes under contract flying arrangements. The
Company is compensated on a fee-per-departure basis plus incentive payments
based on operational performance. The fee-per-departure and incentive amounts
are negotiated on an annual basis based on projected operating costs. The
agreements with Delta and United contain certain provisions pursuant to which
the parties could terminate the agreement, subject to certain rights of the
other party, if certain performance criteria are not maintained.


DEFERRED CREDITS

The Company accounts for incentives provided by aircraft manufacturers as
deferred credits for leased aircraft. These credits are amortized on a
straight-line basis as a reduction to lease expense over the respective lease
term. The incentives are credits that may be used to purchase spare parts and
pay for training expenses.


INCOME TAXES

The Company recognizes a liability or asset for the deferred tax consequences of
all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result
in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of
the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. As of December 31, 2001 and
2000, the Company had recorded current deferred tax assets of $7,769,000 and
$10,194,000, respectively (which are included in other current assets), and
deferred tax liabilities of $41,643,000 and $33,773,000, respectively.


NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

Basic net income per common share ("Basic EPS") excludes dilution and is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share ("Diluted
EPS") reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
The computation of Diluted EPS does not assume exercise or conversion of
securities that would have an antidilutive effect on net income per common
share. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, 1,046,000, zero,
and 340,000 options were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

The Company reports comprehensive income in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") Statement No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive
income includes charges and credits to stockholders' equity that are not the
results of transactions with shareholders. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
comprehensive income includes net income and adjustments, net of tax, to reflect
unrealized appreciation and depreciation on marketable securities. The Company
recorded net unrealized depreciation of $615,000 and $975,000, net of income
taxes, on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. These adjustments have been reflected in the accompanying
consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.


IMPAIRED LONG LIVED ASSETS

The Company has approximately $586 million of long-lived assets as of December
31, 2001, including approximately $386 million of flight equipment and related
fixed assets. In addition to the original cost of these assets, their recorded
value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the Company, including
estimated useful lives and salvage values. The Company reviews its long-lived
assets for impairment at each balance sheet date for events or changes in
circumstances that may indicate the book value of an asset may not be
recoverable. The Company uses an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows
of the related asset or group of assets over the remaining life in measuring
whether the assets are recoverable. The Company assesses the impairment of
long-lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash
flows that are independent of other groups of assets.


NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which
requires companies to record derivative financial instruments on the balance
sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses
resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for
depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge
accounting. The key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging
relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair
value or cash flows. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date
of FASB Statement No. 133, which amends SFAS No. 133 to be effective for all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In June 2000,
the FASB issued Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments
and Certain Hedging Activities -- an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS
No. 138 amends SFAS No. 133 to (a) exclude from the scope of SFAS No. 133
nonfinancial assets that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or
sold by a company over a reasonable period in the normal course of business and
for which physical delivery is probable, (b) permit hedging of a benchmark
interest rate, (c) allow hedging of foreign-currency-denominated assets and
liabilities and (d) allow for limited hedging of net foreign currency exposures.
The Company has no derivative financial and commodity instruments, forward
contracts or hedging arrangements in cash and cash equivalents. The Company
adopted these statements for the year ended December 31, 2001, which did not
have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.


<PAGE>
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the
purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination. SFAS
No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets
acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS No. 142 provides
that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized, but will
rather be tested at least annually for impairment. The Company adopted SFAS No.
141 and No. 142 on January 1, 2002, which did not have a material impact on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, with
earlier application encouraged. This statement requires entities to record the
fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in
which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity
capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period,
and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation
for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. The adoption
of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which replaces SFAS Statement No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
of, and is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2001. The accounting
model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long-lived
assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 30, Reporting Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, for the disposal of segments of a business.
This statement requires that those long-lived assets be measured at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing
operations or in discontinued operations. Therefore, discontinued operations
will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for
operating loses that have not yet occurred. This statement also broadens the
reporting of discontinued operations. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.


FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and
cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair values
because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
Marketable securities are reported at fair value in the consolidated balance
sheets. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on
current rates offered to the Company for similar debt and approximates
$116,000,000 as of December 31, 2001, as compared to the carrying amount of
$125,839,000.


SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. This statement requires disclosures related
to components of a company for which separate financial information is available
that is evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Management
believes that the Company has only one operating segment in accordance with SFAS
No. 131 because the Company's business consists of scheduled airline passenger
service.

</TABLE>

The Company's long-term debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of
Brasilia and CRJ aircraft. Certain amounts related to the Brasilia aircraft are
supported by continuing subsidy payments through the export support program of
the Federative Republic of Brazil. The subsidy payments reduce the stated
interest rates to an average effective rate of approximately 3.7%, on $22.5
million of the long-term debt, at December 31, 2001. The continuing subsidy
payments are at risk to the Company if the Federative Republic of Brazil does
not meet its obligations under the export support program. While the Company has
no reason to believe, based on information currently available, that the Company
will not continue to receive these subsidy payments from the Federative Republic
of Brazil in the future, there can be no assurance that such a default will not
occur. On the remaining long-term debt related to the Brasilia aircraft of $22.4
million, the lender has assumed the risk of the subsidy payments which has
reduced the average effective rate on this debt to approximately 3.8% at
December 31, 2001. The average effective rate on the debt related to the CRJ
aircraft of $80.9 million was 6.1% at December 31, 2001, and is not subject to
subsidy payments.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company had available $10,000,000 in an unsecured
bank line of credit through December 15, 2002, with interest payable at the
bank's base rate less one-quarter percent, which was a net rate of 4.5%. The
line of credit provides for a total of $10,000,000 available for borrowings or
letters of credit with the same institution. The Company had $5,534,000 of
letters of credit and no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit as of
December 31, 2001.

Certain of the Company's long-term debt arrangements contain limitations on,
among other things, the sale or lease of assets and ratio of long-term debt to
tangible net worth. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with
all the debt covenants.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires pro forma information
regarding net income and net income per share as if the Company had accounted
for its stock options under the fair value method of the statement. The fair
value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants in the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: a risk-free interest rate of 5.1% for
2001, 5.1% for 2000 and 6.5% for 1999, a volatility factor of the expected
common stock price of .642 for 2001, .520 for 2000 and .549 for 1999 and a
weighted average expected life of four years for the stock options for all the
years presented. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
value of the stock options and employee stock purchases is amortized over the
vesting period of the respective stock options and employee stock purchases.
