                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

SkyWest, Inc. (the "Company"), through its wholly owned subsidiary, SkyWest
Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest"), operates one of the larger regional airlines in the
United States. SkyWest offers scheduled passenger and air freight service with
over 1,000 daily departures to 66 cities in 14 western states and Canada.
SkyWest has been a code-sharing partner with Delta Air Lines, Inc. ("Delta") in
Salt Lake City and United Airlines ("United") in Los Angeles since 1987 and
1997, respectively. In April 1998, SkyWest expanded its United Express Agreement
to provide service as United Express in United's Portland and Seattle/Tacoma
markets and in additional Los Angeles markets, which began in April 1998. In
January 1998, SkyWest expanded its operations to serve as the United Express
carrier in San Francisco, which began in June 1998. Today, SkyWest operates as
the Delta Connection in Salt Lake City and as United Express in Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Denver and in the Pacific Northwest. SkyWest believes that its
success in attracting multiple code-sharing relationships is attributable to its
delivery of high quality customer service with an all cabin-class fleet. As of
May 31, 2001, 53 percent of SkyWest's traffic was carried under the Delta code,
and 47 percent was carried under the United code. Additionally, 23.4 percent of
SkyWest's flights operated under the Delta code and 76.6 percent operated under
the United code. With principal hubs located at Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, San
Francisco, Portland and Seattle/Tacoma, SkyWest offers a convenient and frequent
flight schedule designed to maximize connecting and origin-destination traffic
for its major code-sharing partners. As of March 31, 2001, SkyWest operated a
fleet of 91 Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops ("Brasilias") and 17 Canadair
Regional Jets ("CRJs").

Multiple code-sharing relationships have enabled SkyWest to reduce reliance on
any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results
through a mix of SkyWest-controlled flying and contract flying. On
SkyWest-controlled flights, SkyWest controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares. On contract
routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories with SkyWest receiving from its major airline partners
negotiated payments per flight departure and incentives related to passenger
volumes and levels of customer service. As of March 31, 2001, approximately 69
percent of SkyWest's capacity was in contract flying and 31 percent was in
SkyWest-controlled flying. Another benefit of the multiple code-sharing
relationships is the ability to grow within two major airline systems. The
Company has agreements to acquire an additional 113 CRJs with options for an
additional 119 aircraft with deliveries which began in April 2001. These
aircraft will be allocated between Delta Connection and United Express
operations.

Since being founded in 1972, the Company has experienced significant growth.
During the past five fiscal years, consolidated operating revenues have
increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 21.2 percent, from $245.8
million in fiscal 1997 to $531.1 million in fiscal 2001. Total passengers
carried by SkyWest have increased from approximately 2,657,000 to approximately
5,677,000 over the same period. In fiscal 2001, the Company experienced growth
in available seat miles, revenue passenger miles, passengers carried and load
factors. The Company generated net income of $57.1 million in both fiscal 2001
and 2000 and $41.8 million in fiscal 1999. During fiscal 1999, the Company sold
the operations of Scenic Airlines, Inc., and recorded a loss on the sale of $0.8
million net of income taxes. The amount has been reflected as discontinued
operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements. During fiscal
2001, the Company sold the operations of National Parks Transportation in order
to focus on the core airline business and continued development of its Delta and
United relationships. The improvement since fiscal 1999 reflects, among other
factors, the addition of United as a code-sharing partner in October 1997.

JOINT MARKETING AND CODE SHARING AGREEMENTS

Since April 1987, SkyWest has operated as the Delta Connection in certain
SkyWest markets pursuant to the terms of a joint marketing and code sharing
agreement with Delta. In July 1990, SkyWest and Delta entered into a revised
Delta Connection Agreement, modified in April 1997 and May 1999, under which
SkyWest coordinates with Delta to facilitate interline connections at the Salt
Lake City International Airport. The primary benefit of this affiliation is the
use of the Delta designation code (DL) in listing flights in the Official
Airline Guide and in the computerized reservation systems used throughout the
industry. SkyWest's code sharing arrangement allocates to SkyWest, on



                                       3
<PAGE>   4

certain flights, a portion of the passenger fare on a formula or other basis,
subject to periodic adjustments. This code sharing agreement also provides for
negotiated minimum payments per flight departure and incentives related to
passenger volumes and levels of customer service, on certain flights. SkyWest
also participates in cooperative advertising and marketing activities with
Delta, including Delta's Frequent Flyer Program, the Delta Meeting Network and
Delta Dream Vacations.

The Company believes the arrangement created between SkyWest and Delta is
similar to those which exist between other major and regional airlines. The
Delta Connection Agreement terminates in June 2010, and is subject to earlier
termination in various circumstances, including upon 180 days advance notice by
either party for any or no reason. As of March 31, 2001, NewSky, Ltd., a
subsidiary of Delta, owned 6,215,596 shares of the Company's common stock, which
represents approximately 11.1 percent of the Company's outstanding common stock.
Pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement between Delta and the Company, Delta holds
preemptive rights and registration rights (two demand rights and unlimited
"piggy-back" rights) with respect to the common stock owned by Delta, as well as
the right to designate one nominee for the Company's Board of Directors, so long
as Delta owns at least ten percent of all outstanding shares of common stock.
Effective April 1, 1997, W. Martin Braham, Delta's designated Board member
resigned from the Board, at Delta's request. All Delta designated board members
of other regional airlines with similar arrangements also resigned. However, so
long as Delta is the owner of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding shares of
common stock, Delta has the right to include a designee of Delta reasonably
acceptable to the Company on the slate of nominees for election of directors
nominated by the Company's Board of Directors and the Company is obligated to
use its best efforts to assure the election of Delta's designee to the Board of
Directors. Delta has not designated a nominee to replace Mr. Braham and the
Company does not otherwise intend to nominate a replacement for the vacancy
created by Mr. Braham's resignation.

Effective October 1997, SkyWest began operating as a United Express carrier in
Los Angeles, under a United Express Agreement. The benefits under this agreement
are similar to those described under the Delta Connection agreement. This
agreement terminates on September 30, 2002. However, it may be terminated
earlier based on certain provisions in the agreement. United may also terminate
the agreement for convenience upon 180 days written notice. In April 1998,
SkyWest expanded its United Express Agreement to provide service as United
Express in United's Portland and Seattle/Tacoma markets and in additional Los
Angeles markets, which began in April 1998. In January 1998, SkyWest expanded
its operations to serve as the United Express carrier in San Francisco, which
began in June 1998. The amendment agreements executed in January and February
1998 terminate in May 2008. However, they may be terminated earlier based on
certain provisions in the agreements. The additional flights in Los Angeles
covered in the April 1998 agreement terminate on the same day as those in the
agreement dated October 1997. United may also terminate these agreements for
convenience upon 180 days written notice. On United Express routes, United
controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories with SkyWest
receiving from United negotiated minimum payments per flight departure and
incentives related to passenger and volumes and levels of customer service.

MARKETS AND ROUTES

SkyWest's flight schedules are structured to facilitate the connection of its
passengers with flights of Delta and United at the airports it serves. The

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

All interstate air carriers, including SkyWest, are subject to regulation by the
DOT, the FAA and certain other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by
the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA requires
operating, air worthiness and other certificates; approval of personnel who may
engage in flight, maintenance or operation activities; record keeping procedures
in accordance with FAA requirements; and FAA approval of flight training and
retraining programs. Generally, governmental agencies enforce their regulations
through, among other mechanisms, certifications, which are necessary for
SkyWest's continued operations, and proceedings, which can result in civil or
criminal penalties or revocation of operating authority. The FAA can also issue
maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other
things, grounding of aircraft, inspection of aircraft, installation of new
safety-related items and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts
that have failed or may fail in the future.

SkyWest believes it is operating in compliance with FAA regulations and holds
all necessary operating and airworthiness certificates and licenses. The Company
incurs substantial costs in maintaining current certifications and otherwise
complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject. SkyWest's
flight operations, maintenance programs, record keeping and training programs
are conducted under FAA approved procedures. SkyWest does not operate at any
airports where landing slots are restricted.

All air carriers are required to comply with federal laws and regulations
pertaining to noise abatement and engine emissions. All air carriers are also
subject to certain provisions of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, because of their extensive use of radio and other communication
facilities. The Company is also subject to certain other federal and state laws
relating to protection of the environment, labor relations and equal employment
opportunity. Management believes that the Company is in compliance in
all-material respects with these laws and regulations.

COMPETITION AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

The airline industry is highly competitive. The Company not only competes with
other regional airlines, some of which are owned by or are operated as code
sharing partners of major airlines, but also faces competition from low-fare
airlines and major airlines on certain routes. The Company is the dominant
regional airline operating out of the Salt Lake City International Airport:
however, Southwest Airlines, a national low-fare airline, also operates out of
the Salt Lake City International Airport, which results in significant price
competition at the Salt Lake City hub. Competition in the Southern California
and Pacific Northwest markets, which the Company serves from its hubs in Los
Angeles, Seattle/Tacoma and Portland, is particularly intense, with a large
number of carriers in these markets. The Company's principal competitor in the
Los Angeles International Airport is American Eagle. The Company's principal
competitor in the Seattle/Tacoma and Portland markets is Horizon Airlines.

The principal competitive factors in the regional airline industry are fare
pricing, customer service, routes served, flight schedules, aircraft types and
code-sharing relationships. Certain of the Company's competitors are larger and
have significantly greater financial resources than the Company. Moreover,
federal deregulation of the industry allows competitors to rapidly enter markets
and to quickly discount and restructure fares. The airline industry is
particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only
nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats.

Generally, the airline industry is highly sensitive to general economic
conditions, in large part due to the discretionary nature of a substantial
percentage of both business and pleasure travel. In the past, many airlines have
reported decreased earnings or substantial losses resulting from periods of
economic recession, heavy fare discounting and other factors. Economic downturns
combined with competitive pressures have contributed to a number of bankruptcies
and liquidations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic
downturns is somewhat mitigated by the Company's fixed-fee arrangements with
respect to certain flights. Nonetheless, the per passenger component in such fee
structures would be affected by an economic downturn. In addition, if the
Company's major airline code-sharing partners experience longer-term declines in
passenger loads or are injured by low ticket prices or high fuel prices, they
will likely seek to reduce the Company's fixed fees or cancel a number of
flights in order to reduce their costs.

EMPLOYEES

As of June 15, 2001, the Company employed 4,383 full-time equivalent employees
consisting of 1,715 pilots and flight attendants, 1,869 customer service
personnel, 557 mechanics and other maintenance personnel, and 242 administration
and support personnel. The Company's employees are not currently represented by
any union. However, the Company is aware that collective bargaining group
organization efforts among its employees occur from time to time and expect that
such efforts will continue in the future. During August 1999, the question of
whether or not to join the Airline Pilots Association ("ALPA") was submitted to
the Company's pilots, who voted against joining ALPA by a narrow margin. Under
governing rules, the Company's pilots may again vote on this issue at any time
because one year has passed since the previous vote. If unionization efforts are
successful, the Company may by subjected to risks of work interruption or
stoppage and/or incur additional expenses associated with union representation
of its employees. In connection with the Company's proposed acquisition of an
additional 113 CRJs and related expansion, the Company anticipates hiring
approximately 3,500 additional employees, many of whom may be represented by a
union in their current employment. The Company has never experienced any work
stoppages and considers its relationships with its employees to be very good.

SEASONALITY

As is common in the airline industry, SkyWest's operations are favorably
affected by increased travel, historically occurring in the summer months, and
are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from
November through January and by inclement weather which occasionally results in
cancelled flights, principally during the winter months. However, SkyWest does
expect some mitigation of the historical seasonal trends due to an increase in
the portion of its operations in contract flying.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various forward-looking statements and
information that are based on management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made
by and information currently available to management. When used in this
document, the words "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "expect," and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although the
Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will
prove to have been correct. Such statements are subject to certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or
uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected
or expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on the
Company's operating results include, among other things, changes in SkyWest's
code-sharing relationships, fluctuations in the economy and the demand for air
travel, the degree and nature of competition and SkyWest's ability to expand
services in new and existing markets and to maintain profit margins in the face
of pricing pressures.

SkyWest's aircraft are turboprop and jet pressurized aircraft designed to
operate more economically over short-haul routes with lower passenger load
factors than larger jet aircraft. These factors make it economically feasible
for SkyWest to provide high frequency service in markets with relatively low
volumes of passenger traffic. Passenger comfort features of these aircraft
include stand-up headroom, a lavatory, overhead baggage compartments and flight
attendant service. Fiscal year 1995 marked the introduction of the CRJs. SkyWest
currently operates 26 of these aircraft on stage lengths up to 850 miles.

During fiscal 2001, SkyWest took delivery of six CRJs in connection with the
Delta Connection and United Express expansion. Additionally, as of March 31,
2001 SkyWest had agreed to acquire an additional 113 CRJs and related spare
parts inventory and support equipment at an aggregate cost of approximately $2.4
billion. SkyWest commenced delivery of these aircraft in April 2001 and
deliveries are scheduled to continue through December 2004. Depending on the
state of the aircraft financing market at the time of delivery, management will
determine whether to acquire these aircraft through third party, long-term loans
or lease agreements. SkyWest also has options to acquire 119 additional CRJs at
fixed prices (subject to cost escalations) and the delivery schedules are
exercisable at various dates through April 2008.

GROUND FACILITIES

Employees of SkyWest perform substantially all routine airframe and engine
maintenance and periodic inspection of equipment. Maintenance is performed
primarily at facilities in Palm Springs, California, Salt Lake City, Utah, and
Fresno, California. SkyWest owns a 56,600 square foot maintenance facility in
Palm Springs, California and leases a 90,000 square foot aircraft maintenance
and training facility at the Salt Lake City International Airport. The facility
consists of a 40,000 square foot maintenance hangar and 50,000 square feet of
training and other facilities. The facility was constructed and is owned by the
Salt Lake City Airport Authority. SkyWest is leasing the facility under an
operating lease arrangement over a 36-year term. The Company also leases a
90,000 square foot maintenance hanger and 15,000 square foot office facility in
Fresno, California. SkyWest began construction on an additional aircraft
maintenance and training facility in Salt Lake City during September 2000. It is
estimated that the facility will be completed and operational by July 2001. The
facility is 131,300 square feet, consisting of a 58,400 square foot maintenance
hangar and 72,900 square feet of training and office space. It is anticipated
that the facility will be owned by the Salt Lake City Airport Authority and will
be leased to SkyWest under a long-term lease arrangement.

SkyWest leases ticket counters, check-in and boarding and other facilities in
the passenger terminal areas in the majority of the airports it serves and
staffs these facilities with SkyWest personnel. Delta and United provide ticket
handling and/or ground support services for SkyWest in 33 of the 68 airports
SkyWest serves.

The Company's corporate headquarters are located in a 63,000 square foot
building in St. George, Utah. The Company is in the construction phase for an
additional building adjacent to its current corporate headquarters in St.
George, Utah. It is estimated that the facility will be completed and
operational in November 2001. The facility will consist of approximately 55,000
square feet and will include office space for maintenance management and flight
operations including pilot management, dispatch and flight attendant management.
The facility will be owned by the Company and will be internally funded with
cash generated from operations. Management deems the Company's current and
planned facilities as being suitable and necessary to support existing
operations and believes the Company's facilities will be adequate for the
foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to certain legal actions, which it considers routine to
its business activities. As of March 31, 2001, management believes, after the
consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate outcome of such legal matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.


ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2001.

                         ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE


To SkyWest, Inc.:

We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States, the consolidated financial statements included in SkyWest, Inc.'s
Annual Report to Shareholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and
have issued our report thereon dated May 16, 2001. Our audits were made for the
purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a
whole. The schedule listed in Item 14 (a)(2) is the responsibility of the
Company's management and is presented for the purpose of complying with the

                         SKYWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


(1)     NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        SkyWest, Inc. (a Utah corporation) through its wholly owned subsidiary
SkyWest Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest"), operates a regional airline offering
scheduled passenger service with over 1,000 daily departures to 66 cities in 14
western states and Canada. SkyWest has been a code-sharing partner with Delta
Air Lines, Inc. ("Delta") and United Airlines, Inc. ("United") since 1987 and
1997, respectively. SkyWest operates as the Delta Connection in Salt Lake City
and as the United Express carrier in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver and in
the Pacific Northwest. Revenues generated in connection with the code-sharing
relationships with Delta and United account for a significant majority of
SkyWest's passenger revenues.

        Multiple code-sharing relationships have enabled SkyWest to reduce
reliance on any single major airline code and enhance and stabilize operating
results through a mix of SkyWest-controlled flying and contract flying. On
SkyWest controlled flights, SkyWest controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares. On contract
routes, the major partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing, and seat
inventories with SkyWest receiving from its major airline partners negotiated
payments per flight departure and incentives related to passenger volumes and
levels of customer service. As of March 31, 2001, approximately 69 percent of
SkyWest's capacity was in contract flying and 31 percent was in SkyWest
controlled flying.


CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
SkyWest, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, SkyWest and National Parks
Transportation, Inc. ("NPT"), collectively (the "Company"). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

During fiscal 2001, the Company sold the operations of National Parks
Transportation. During fiscal 1999, the Company sold the operations of Scenic
Airlines, Inc. ("Scenic"), (see Note 7).


USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES

The Company's investments in debt and equity securities have been classified as
available-for-sale securities and are recorded at fair market value. The
Company's position in available-for-sale securities consists primarily of
investment grade bonds, bond funds and commercial paper. Unrealized appreciation
and depreciation are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income/loss in stockholders' equity.

INVENTORIES

Inventories include expendable parts, fuel and supplies and are valued at cost
(FIFO basis) less an allowance for obsolescence. Expendable inventory parts are
charged to expense as used.



<PAGE>   7

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their useful
lives to their estimated residual values using the straight-line method as
follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S>                                                             <C>
                 Aircraft and rotable spares                      3 - 14 years
                 Buildings and ground equipment                 3 - 39.5 years
                 Rental vehicles                                       4 years
</TABLE>

During the year ended March 31, 2001, the Company capitalized $2,150,000 of
interest cost related to long-term construction projects and advanced payments
on aircraft contracts.

MAINTENANCE

The Company operates under an FAA approved continuous inspection and maintenance
program. The normal cost of recurring maintenance is charged to expense when
incurred. The Company uses the deferred method of accounting for overhauls of
Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia ("Brasilia") engines and uses the accrual method of
accounting for overhauls of Canadair Regional Jet ("CRJ") engines.

PASSENGER AND FREIGHT REVENUES

Passenger and freight revenues are recognized when service is provided.
Passenger tickets sold but not used and the liability to other airlines are
recorded as air traffic liability.

INCOME TAXES

The Company recognizes a liability or asset for the deferred tax consequences of
all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result
in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of
the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. As of March 31, 2001 and
2000, the Company had recorded current deferred tax assets of $10,510,000 and
$9,991,000, respectively (which are included in other current assets), and
deferred tax liabilities of $35,699,000 and $29,995,000, respectively.

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

Basic net income per common share ("Basic EPS") excludes dilution and is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share
("Diluted EPS") reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock
options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock. The computation of Diluted EPS does not assume exercise or
conversion of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on net income
per common share.

Following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of Basic EPS to
the numerator and denominator of Diluted EPS for all periods presented (in
thousands, except per share amounts):

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

The Company reports comprehensive income in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income"
which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income
and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive income includes
charges and credits to stockholders' equity that are not the results of
transactions with shareholders. As of March 31, 2001 and 2000, comprehensive
income includes net income and adjustments, net of tax, to reflect unrealized
appreciation and depreciation on available-for-sale securities. The Company
recorded unrealized appreciation of $666,000 and unrealized depreciation of
$1,591,000 in available-for-sale securities for the years ended March 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively. These adjustments have been reflected in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity net of estimated
income taxes.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 1998, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133")
which was amended in June 1999 to delay the effective date. SFAS 133 establishes
new accounting and reporting standards for companies to report information about
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts and for hedging activities. The Company adopted SFAS 133 as of
April 1, 2001. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and
cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, receivables and accounts
payable approximate fair values because of the immediate or short-term maturity
of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt
is estimated based on current rates offered to the Company for similar debt and
approximates $78,175,000 as of March 31, 2001, as compared to the carrying
amount of $84,101,000.

SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information". This statement requires disclosures related
to components of a company for which separate financial information is available
that is evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Management
believes that the Company has only one operating segment in accordance with SFAS
No. 131 because the Company's business consists of scheduled airline passenger
service.

The Company's long-term debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of
Brasilia and CRJ aircraft. Certain amounts related to the Brasilia aircraft are
supported by continuing subsidy payments through the export support program of
the Federative Republic of Brazil. The subsidy payments reduce the stated
interest rates to an average effective rate of approximately 4.08 percent, on
$27.8 million of the long-term debt, at March 31, 2001. The continuing subsidy
payments are at risk to the Company if the Federative Republic of Brazil does
not meet its obligations under the export support program. While the Company has
no reason to believe, based on information currently available, that the Company
will not continue to receive these subsidy payments from the Federative Republic
of Brazil in the future, there can be no assurance that such a default will not
occur. On the remaining long-term debt related to the Brasilia aircraft of $24.2
million, the lender has assumed the risk of the subsidy payments which has
reduced the average effective rate on this debt to approximately 3.82 percent at
March 31, 2001. The average effective rate on the debt related to the CRJ
aircraft of $32.1 million was 7.26% at March 31, 2001, and is not subject to
subsidy payments.

As of March 31, 2001, the Company had available $7,474,000 in an unsecured bank
line of credit with interest payable at the bank's base rate less one-quarter
percent, which was a net rate of 7.75 percent. The line of credit provides for a
total of $10,000,000 available for borrowings or letters of credit with the same
institution. The Company had $2,526,000 of letters of credit and no borrowings
outstanding under this line of credit as of March 31, 2001.

Certain of the Company's long-term debt arrangements contain limitations on,
among other things, sale or lease of assets and ratio of long-term debt to
tangible net worth. As of March 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all
the debt covenants.

LEASE OBLIGATIONS

The Company leases 85 aircraft, as well as airport facilities, office space, and
various other property and equipment under noncancelable operating leases which
are generally on a long-term net rent basis where the Company pays taxes,
maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses applicable to the
leased property. Management expects that, in the normal course of business,
leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by other leases. The following
summarizes future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that
have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of
March 31, 2001 (in thousands):

at various dates through April 2008. These aircraft will be allocated between
the United Express and Delta Connection operations.

its business activities. As of March 31, 2001, management believes, after the
consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate outcome of such legal matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

without any further action by the stockholders of the Company, to (i) divide the
preferred stock into series; (ii) designate each such series; (iii) fix and
determine dividend rights; (iv) determine the price, terms and conditions on
which shares of preferred stock may be redeemed; (v) determine the amount
payable to holders of preferred stock in the event of voluntary or involuntary
liquidation; (vi) determine any sinking fund provisions; and (vii) establish any
conversion privileges.

STOCK OPTIONS

On August 8, 2000, the stockholders approved the adoption of two new stock
option plans: the Executive Stock Incentive Plan ("Executive Plan") and the 2001
Allshare Stock Option Plan ("Allshare Plan"). Both plans became effective
January 1, 2001. These plans replaced the Company's Combined Incentive and
Non-Statutory Stock Option Plans ("Prior Plans"), however, all outstanding
options under Prior Plans remain outstanding. No further grants will be made
under the Prior Plans. As of December 31, 2000, there were approximately
2,891,000 options outstanding under the Prior Plans. The Executive Plan provides
for the issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock to officers,
directors and other management employees. The Allshare Plan provides for the
issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock to employees. The Executive
Plan and Allshare Plan are both administered by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors who designate option grants as either incentive or
non-statutory. Incentive stock options are granted at not less than 100 percent
of the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
Non-statutory stock options are granted at a price as determined by the
Compensation Committee.

Options are exercisable for a period as defined by the Compensation Committee at
the date granted; however, no stock option will be exercisable before six months
have elapsed from the date it is granted and no incentive stock option shall be
exercisable after ten years from the date of grant. The following table
summarizes the stock option activity for all plans for the years ended March 31,

5. CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS (continued)

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. SFAS No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," requires pro forma information
regarding net income and net income per share as if the Company had accounted
for its stock options under the fair value method of the statement. The fair
value of these stock options was estimated at the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for
grants in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999: a risk-free interest rate of 6.5 percent
for fiscal 2001, 5.5 percent for fiscal 2000 and 4.8 percent for fiscal 1999, a
dividend yield of .0001 percent for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, a volatility
factor of the expected common stock price of .451 for fiscal 2001, .496 for
fiscal 2000 and .465 for fiscal 1999 and a weighted average expected life of
four years for the stock options for all the years presented. For purposes of
the pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the stock options and
employee stock purchases is amortized over the vesting period of the respective
stock options and employee stock purchases.


Following are the pro forma disclosures and the related impact on net income and
net income per share (in thousands, except per share information):

age are eligible for participation in the Plan. Employees may elect to make
contributions to the Plan. The Company matches 100 percent of such contributions
up to 2 percent, 4 percent or 6 percent of the individual participant's
compensation, based upon length of service. Additionally, a discretionary

have completed 90 days of employment are eligible to participate, except
employees who own five percent or more of the Company's common stock. The Stock
Purchase Plan enables employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock
at a 15 percent discount, through payroll deductions. Employees can contribute
two to 15 percent of their base pay, not to exceed $21,250 each calendar year,
for the purchase of shares. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, 179,786

the date of disposition as income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of
income taxes and net assets of discontinued operations. The revenues of Scenic
amounted to $28.0 million for the year ended March 31, 1999.

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                       CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Overview

The Company, through SkyWest Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest"), operates a regional
airline offering scheduled passenger service with over 1,000 daily departures to
66 cities in 14 western states and Canada. All of our flights are operated as
either Delta Connection or United Express under code-sharing arrangements with
Delta Air Lines, Inc., ("Delta") or United Airlines, Inc. ("United"). Total
operating revenues and passengers carried have grown consistently from fiscal
1997 through fiscal 2001, at compounded annual growth rates of approximately
21.2 percent and 20.9 percent, respectively. In fiscal 1997, SkyWest generated
approximately 1.4 billion available seat miles ("ASMs") and had a fleet of fifty
30-seat Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops ("Brasilias") and ten Canadair
Regional Jets ("CRJs") at fiscal year end. As a result of additional aircraft
acquisitions, SkyWest generated approximately 2.3 billion ASMs in fiscal 2001
with a fleet of 91 Brasilias and 17 CRJs at fiscal year end.

SkyWest has been a code-sharing partner with Delta in Salt Lake City and United
in Los Angeles since 1987 and 1997, respectively. In April 1998, SkyWest
expanded its United Express Agreement to provide service as United Express in
United's Portland and Seattle/Tacoma markets and in additional Los Angeles
markets which began in April 1998. In January 1998, SkyWest expanded its
SkyWest's operations to serve as the United Express carrier in San Francisco
which began in June 1998. Today, SkyWest operates as the Delta Connection in
Salt Lake City and as United Express in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver and
in the Pacific Northwest. SkyWest believes that its success in attracting
multiple code-sharing relationships is attributed to its delivery of high
quality customer service with an all cabin-class fleet.

The Company generated net income of $57.1 million in both fiscal 2001 and 2000
and $41.8 million in fiscal 1999. During fiscal 1999, the Company sold the
operations of Scenic Airlines, Inc., and recorded a loss on the sale of $0.8
million net of income taxes. The amount has been reflected as Discontinued
Operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Additionally,
during the 2001 fiscal year the Company sold the operations of National Parks
Transportation in order to focus on the core airline business and continue
development of our Delta and United relationships. The sale resulted in an
immaterial gain to the overall consolidated financial statements. The
improvement since fiscal 1999 reflects, among other factors, the expansion of
service as a Delta Connection or United Express carrier in the western United
States.

Multiple code-sharing relationships have enabled SkyWest to reduce reliance on
any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results
through a mix of SkyWest-controlled flying and contract flying. On
SkyWest-controlled flights, SkyWest controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares. On contract
routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and
seat inventories with SkyWest receiving from its major airline partners
negotiated payments per flight departure and incentives related to passenger
volumes and levels of customer service. As of March 31, 2001, approximately 69
percent of SkyWest's capacity was in contract flying and 31 percent was in
SkyWest-controlled flying. Another benefit of the multiple code-sharing
relationships is the ability to grow within two major airline systems. The
Company has agreements to acquire an additional 113 CRJs with options for an
additional 119 aircraft with deliveries which began in April 2001. These
aircraft will be allocated between the Delta Connection and United Express
operations.

FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000

During fiscal 2001, SkyWest continued to improve upon its code-sharing
arrangements with its major code-sharing partners and took delivery of six CRJ's
in connection with the Delta Connection and United Express expansion. As a
result, SkyWest experienced growth in available seat miles ("ASMs"), revenue
passenger miles ("RPMs"), passengers carried and load factors. Consolidated
operating revenues increased 11.9 percent to a record $531.1 million in fiscal
2001 compared to $474.8 million in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2001 and 2000 net
income remained constant at $57.1 million. However, diluted earnings per share
decreased to $1.05 for the year ended March 31, 2001 from $1.15 for the year
ended March 31, 2000, due to the Company issuing 5,791,000 shares of common
stock on September 12, 2000.

Passenger revenues, which represented 98.8 percent of total operating revenues
in fiscal 2001, increased 12.5 percent to $524.9 million in fiscal 2001 compared
to $466.7 million or 98.3 percent of total operating revenues in fiscal 2000.
The increase was due to a 9.6 percent increase in RPMs. The increase in RPMs was
primarily the result of six additional regional jet aircraft deliveries.
Additionally, the Company implemented selected fare increases during 2001 which
have remained in effect. Fuel surcharges have also been added to fares in an
effort to mitigate the effect of the increased fuel prices. On
SkyWest-controlled flights, SkyWest also continued to use a sophisticated
revenue management and control system which utilizes historical booking data to
optimize revenue. In spite of the 12.5 percent increase in passenger revenues,
the increase did not keep pace with operating costs due to the impact of
inclement weather and air traffic control flight cancellations during the winter
months. Notwithstanding the effect of increased operating costs, SkyWest
recorded a 5.5 percent increase in revenue per ASM to 23.0 [cents] for the year
ended March 31, 2001 from 21.8 [cents] for the year ended March 31, 2000.

During fiscal 2001, total airline operating revenues increased 11.9 percent and
total airline operating expenses increased 16.6 percent. As a result, total
airline operating expenses and interest were 85.5 percent of total airline
operating revenues in fiscal 2001 compared to 82.2 percent in fiscal 2000.

Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased as a percentage of airline
operating revenues to 27.0 percent in fiscal 2001 from 25.9 percent in fiscal
2000. The increase was primarily the result of the increase in the number of
personnel associated with the current and future expansion with United Express
and Delta Connection. The average number of employees was 3,772 for fiscal 2001
compared to 3,302 for fiscal 2000, an increase of 14.2 percent. Salaries, wages
and employee benefits per ASM increased to 6.2 [cents] in fiscal 2001 from 5.7
[cents] in fiscal 2000.



<PAGE>   20

Aircraft costs, including aircraft rent and depreciation, decreased as a
percentage of airline operating revenues to 17.3 percent in fiscal 2001 from
17.4 percent in fiscal 2000. The decrease is due to airline operating revenues
increasing 12.5 percent year over year and aircraft costs increasing only 11.4
percent year over year. Aircraft costs per ASM increased to 4.0 [cents] in
fiscal 2001 from 3.8 [cents] in fiscal 2000, primarily due to the addition of
six new CRJs in fiscal 2001.

Maintenance expense decreased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to
8.4 percent in fiscal 2001 from 9.0 percent in fiscal 2000. The decrease is due
to airline operating revenues increasing 12.5 percent year over year and
maintenance expenses increasing only 4.5 percent year over year along with
adding six new CRJs to the existing fleet. Maintenance cost decreased slightly
per ASM to 1.9 [cents] in fiscal 2001 from 2.0 [cents] in fiscal 2000.

Fuel costs increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to 13.2
percent in fiscal 2001 from 10.2 percent in fiscal 2000. The increase is due to
an increase in the average cost of fuel per gallon to $1.18 in fiscal 2001 from
$0.93 in fiscal 2000. As a result, fuel costs per ASM increased to 3.1 [cents]
in fiscal 2001 from 2.2 [cents] in fiscal 2000. Fuel surcharges also have been
added to fares in an effort to mitigate the effect of increased fuel prices.

Other airline expenses, which consist primarily of commissions, landing fees,
station rents, computer reservation systems and hull and liability insurance,
increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to 19.3 percent in
fiscal 2001 compared to 19.1 percent in fiscal 2000. Cost per ASM increased to
4.4 [cents] in fiscal 2001 from 4.2 [cents] in fiscal 2000.

FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999

During fiscal 2000, SkyWest continued to develop its code-sharing agreements
with its code-sharing partners and took delivery of the last five Brasilias
ordered. SkyWest experienced growth in ASMs, RPMs, passengers carried and load
factors. In fiscal 2000, net income increased 36.5 percent to $57.1 million, or
$1.15 per diluted share, compared to $41.8 million, or $.86 per diluted share in
fiscal 1999. Consolidated operating revenues increased 22.2 percent to a record
$474.8 million in fiscal 2000 compared to $388.6 million in fiscal 1999.

Passenger revenues, which represented 98.3 percent of total operating revenues,
increased 22.4 percent to $466.7 million in fiscal 2000 compared to $381.4
million or 98.1 percent of total operating revenues in fiscal 1999. The increase
was due to a 17.8 percent increase in RPMs and a 4.0 percent increase in yield
per RPM. The increase in yield per RPM was principally the result of competitors
eliminating or reducing scheduled service in the San Francisco and Los Angeles
markets. Additionally, SkyWest implemented several fare increases during the
2000 fiscal year, which have remained intact. Fuel surcharges were also added to
fares to mitigate the increase in fuel prices the last half of the year. With
respect to SkyWest-controlled flying, SkyWest continued to use a sophisticated
revenue management and control system which utilizes historical booking data and
trends to optimize revenue. Together, these factors increased revenue per ASM
3.8 percent to 21.8 [cents] in fiscal 2000, compared to 21.0 [cents] in fiscal
1999.

During fiscal 2000, total airline operating revenues increased 22.2 percent and
total airline operating expenses increased on 19.7 percent. As a result, total
airline operating expenses and interest were 82.2 percent of total airline
operating revenues in fiscal 2000 compared to 84.0 percent in fiscal 1999.

Salaries, wages and employee benefits decreased as a percentage of airline
operating revenues to 25.9 percent in fiscal 2000 from 26.2 percent in fiscal
1999. The decrease was the result of airline operating revenues increasing 22.2
percent year over year and salaries, wages and employee benefits increasing only
21.1 percent year over year. The average number of employees was 3,302 for
fiscal 2000 compared to 3,092 for fiscal 1999, an increase of 6.8 percent. The
increase was due to the addition of personnel required for Sky West's expansion.
Salaries, wages and employee benefits per ASM increased to 5.7 [cents] in fiscal
2000 from 5.5 [cents] in fiscal 1999.

Aircraft costs, including aircraft rent and depreciation, decreased as a
percentage of airline operating revenues to 17.4 percent in fiscal 2000 from
18.2 percent in fiscal 1999. The decrease was due to airline operating revenues
increasing at 22.2 percent year over year and aircraft costs increasing only
16.4 percent year over year. Aircraft costs per ASM were 3.8 for both fiscal
2000 and 1999.



<PAGE>   21

Maintenance expense decreased slightly as a percentage of airline operating
revenues to 9.0 percent in fiscal 2000 from 9.5 percent in fiscal 1999. The
decrease was due to airline operating revenues increasing 22.2 percent year over
year and maintenance expenses increasing only 16.5 percent year over year.
Maintenance cost per ASM was 2.0 [cents] for both fiscal 2000 and 1999.

Fuel costs increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to 10.2
percent in fiscal 2000 from 7.6 percent in fiscal 1999. The increase was due to
an increase in the average cost of fuel per gallon to .93 [cents] in fiscal 2000
from .64 [cents] in fiscal 1999. As a result, fuel costs per ASM increased to
2.2 [cents] in fiscal 2000 from 1.6 [cents] in fiscal 1999.

Other expenses, which consist primarily of commissions, landing fees, station
rents, computer reservation systems and hull and liability insurance, decreased
as a percentage of airline operating revenues to 19.1 percent in fiscal 2000
compared to 21.9 percent in fiscal 1999. The decrease was primarily the result
of the Company not incurring commissions on United Express related passenger
revenues. As a result, cost per ASM decreased to 4.2 [cents] in fiscal 2000 from
4.6  [cents] in fiscal 1999.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company had working capital of $267.0 million and a current ratio of 4.0:1
at March 31, 2001 compared to working capital of $154.2 million and a current
ratio of 2.9:1 at March 31, 2000. The improvement in working capital was
primarily the result of our public common stock offering completed in September
2000, from which we generated net proceeds of $122.1 million. The other
principal sources of funds during fiscal 2001 were $101.7 million generated from
operations, $32.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $4.7
million from the sale of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock
options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and $4.4 million of proceeds from
the sale of property and equipment. During fiscal 2001, the Company invested
$105.4 million in available-for-sale securities, $78.6 million in flight
equipment, $42.1 million in net deposits on aircraft, and $23.1 million in
buildings, ground equipment and other assets. The Company also reduced long-term
debt by $9.0 million and paid $4.2 million in cash dividends. These factors
resulted in a $2.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal
2001.

The Company's position in available--for-sale securities, consisting primarily
of bonds, bond funds and commercial paper, increased to $252.8 million at March
31, 2001 compared to $146.8 million at March 31, 2000. At March 31, 2001, the
Company's ratio of long-term debt to stockholders' equity was 14.8 percent
compared to 15.5 percent at March 31, 2000.

During the 2001 fiscal year, SkyWest took delivery of six CRJs in connection
with the Delta Connection and United Express expansion. Additionally, as of
March 31, 2001 SkyWest had agreed to acquire an additional 113 CRJs and related
spare parts inventory and support equipment at an aggregate cost of
approximately $2.4 billion. SkyWest commenced delivery of these aircraft in
April 2001 and deliveries are scheduled to continue through December 2004.
Depending on the state of the aircraft financing market at the time of delivery,
management will determine whether to acquire these aircraft through third party,
long-term loans or lease agreements. SkyWest also has options to acquire 119
additional CRJs at fixed prices (subject to cost escalations) and delivery
schedules and are exercisable at various dates through April 2008.

The Company has significant long-term lease obligations primarily relating to
its aircraft fleet. These leases are classified as operating leases and
therefore are not reflected as liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance
sheets. At March 31, 2001, the Company leased 85 aircraft with remaining lease
terms ranging from 1 to 16.5 years. Future minimum lease payments due under all
long-term operating leases were approximately $607.9 million at March 31, 2001.
At a 7.5 percent discount factor, the present value of these lease obligations
would be equal to approximately $403.9 million at March 31, 2001.

The Company's long-term debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of
Brasilia and CRJ aircraft. Certain amounts related to the Brasilia aircraft are
supported by continuing subsidy payments through the export support program of
the Federative Republic of Brazil. The subsidy payments reduce the stated
interest rates to an average effective rate of approximately 4.08 percent, on
$27.8 million of the long-term debt, at March 31, 2001. The continuing subsidy
payments are at risk to the Company if the Federative Republic of Brazil does
not meet its obligations under the export support program. While the Company has
no reason to believe, based on information currently available, that the Company
will not continue to receive these subsidy payments from the Federative Republic
of Brazil in the future, there can be no assurance that such a default will not
occur. On the remaining long-term debt related to the Brasilia aircraft of $24.2
million, the lender has assumed the risk of the subsidy payments and the average
effective rate on this debt is approximately 3.82 percent at March 31, 2001. The
average effective rate on the debt related to the CRJ aircraft of $32.1 million
was 7.26% at March 31, 2001, and is not subject to subsidy payments.

The Company expended approximately $62.7 million for non-aircraft capital
expenditures during the year ended March 31, 2001. These expenditures consisted
primarily of $22.2 million for buildings and ground equipment, $21.2 million for
aircraft engine overhauls, $12.9 million for rotable spares, $5.5 million for
aircraft improvements, and $0.9 million for rental vehicles.

The Company has available $10.0 million in an unsecured bank line of credit with
interest payable at the bank's base rate less one-quarter percent, which was a
net rate of 7.75 percent at March 31, 2001. The Company believes that in the
absence of unusual circumstances the working capital available to the Company
will be sufficient to meet its present requirements, including expansion,
capital expenditure, lease payment and debt service requirements for at least
the next 12 months.

SEASONALITY

As is common in the airline industry, SkyWest's operations are favorably
affected by increased travel, historically occurring in the summer months, and
are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from
November through January and by inclement weather which occasionally results in
cancelled flights, principally during the winter months. However, SkyWest does
expect some mitigation of the historical seasonal trends due to an increase in
the portion of its operations in contract flying.
