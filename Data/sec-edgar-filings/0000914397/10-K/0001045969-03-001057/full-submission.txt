                                     PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

General

Great Lakes is a regional airline that began providing scheduled passenger
service under its own marketing identity on October 12, 1981. On April 26, 1992
the Company began operating a large portion of its route network as a United
Express carrier. The United Express marketing program included painting of
aircraft with a United Express paint scheme, branding of station facilities and
outfitting Great Lakes customer service employees with United designated
uniforms. On May 1, 2001, the program with United was terminated and the Company
implemented a new three-year code share agreement with United that included
returning aircraft, station signage and customer service personnel to the Great
Lakes market identity. Subsequently, the Company negotiated a code share
agreement with Frontier Airlines, Inc. which was implemented in phases beginning
on July 7, 2001. Under the terms of the Company's code share agreements,
schedules are published to enable customers of Great Lakes and its code sharing
partners to conveniently book well timed connecting flights. Customers that only
travel to and from the hubs (Denver, Minneapolis and Phoenix) purchase tickets
directly from Great Lakes or travel agents.

As of March 31, 2003, the Company served 32 destinations in nine states to and
from Denver as code sharing partners with both United and Frontier. It also
served four destinations in two states to and from Minneapolis and two
destinations in two states to and from Phoenix. On February 28, 2003, the
Company discontinued its service to the


                                       1

<PAGE>

Chicago hub after the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") elected
to reduce its subsidy funding for service from Chicago.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company's fleet consisted of 37 Beechcraft Model
1900D 19-passenger aircraft and seven Embraer Model 120 30-passenger aircraft.
The Company also has two Beechcraft Model 1900C aircraft that are used
exclusively for freight operations. As more fully explained below, on December
31, 2002, the Company entered into a restructuring agreement (the "Restructuring
Agreement") with Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation ("Raytheon") which, among
other provisions, permits the Company to return to Raytheon seven Model 1900D
aircraft during 2003 that are surplus to the needs of the Company.

Liquidity and Financing

Beginning in 2001, the airline industry suffered substantial declines in revenue
as demand for air service fell due to a variety of factors, including terrorism
and general economic trends. It is unclear when and to what extent demand for
air travel will return. Airlines have also incurred increased expenses,
including insurance and security. As a consequence, most air carriers, including
the Company, have incurred substantial losses.

Due to significant losses in 2001 and 2002, the Company has exhausted its
available sources of working capital and has no financing agreements in place
under which it can secure additional funds. At the end of 2001, the Company was
in arrears in its payments to some institutions providing financing for the
Company's aircraft, which resulted in most of the Company's long-term debt
obligation being reclassified into current liabilities as of December 31, 2001.

On December 31, 2002 and during the first quarter of 2003, the Company
restructured its financing arrangements with Raytheon and certain other
institutions providing financing for the Company's aircraft. The effect of this
restructuring was to reduce the Company's payments to these creditors. It also
provided for the return of surplus aircraft. However, the debt and lease rental
payments to be made under the restructuring agreements are closely aligned with
expected cash flows, and any shortfall from expected cash flows may result in
the Company's inability to make the scheduled payments. There are significant
uncertainties regarding the Company's ability to achieve the required cash flows
because of a variety of factors beyond the Company's control, including the
outcome of United's reorganization in bankruptcy, volatility of fuel prices,
reduced passenger demand, effects of the Iraq conflict and general economic
conditions. See "-- Restructuring Agreement with Raytheon" and "-- Other
Financing" below.

As a result of continued declines in traffic and fare levels as well as slower
receipt of essential air service payments, the Company did not make its February
and March payments under the Restructuring Agreement to Raytheon and will not
make the payments due Raytheon in April 2003. In addition the Company is not in
compliance with certain financial covenants contained in that Agreement. On
April 14, 2003, Raytheon waived the foregoing requirements until June 15, 2003.

At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with its debt agreements or
had obtained amendments or short-term waivers from its lenders with respect to
any nonpayment of scheduled debt installments or noncompliance with financial
covenants. However, the Company cannot determine with a high degree of
confidence that it will be able to make the required payments or remain in
compliance with the agreements during the year 2003. Therefore the amount of
debt that by its terms would otherwise be due after one year is shown as
long-term obligations classified as current. In addition to the contractual
amounts due the lenders, the balance includes $22.3 million of additional
carrying amounts under FAS 15.

The Company plans to continue to seek additional sources of permanent capital;
however, it is unlikely that such capital will be available until the Company
and the airline industry appear capable of returning to a continuing level of
profitability. If the Company is unable to generate adequate funding through
improved financial performance or a combination of additional financing and
further settlements with creditors, the Company may be required to make further
reductions in operating levels and develop other alternatives to provide
sufficient operating funds. No assurances can be made that the Company will be
successful in finding financing alternatives to allow it to continue as a going
concern or that its creditors will not impose conditions that result in a
corporate restructuring or ceasing operations.

The Company's financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result if the Company were forced to discontinue
operations. As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered significant losses in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and
had liabilities in excess of assets at December 31, 2002.


                                       2

<PAGE>

The auditor's report dated March 17, 2003 on the Company's financial statements
states that these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern.

Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 had a significant impact on the
business of the Company. Following the attacks, the Company took immediate
action to reduce its level of operations to better match the reduced level of
passenger demand. However, as was the case with most of the airline industry,
these actions were not sufficient to avoid large economic losses from the
initial grounding of all flights, increased expenses and substantially reduced
passenger revenues.

In response to the terrorist acts, Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety
and System Stabilization Act ("Stabilization Act"). The Stabilization Act
included for all U.S. airlines and air cargo carriers provisions for cash
compensation of $5 billion, of which $1.9 million was allocated to Great Lakes
and received during 2001 and 2002. In addition to benefits for the entire
airline industry, the Stabilization Act also took notice of the unique
requirements of providing service to small communities by increasing funding for
Essential Air Service. See "Essential Air Service Program" below.

Management

On December 31, 2002, the Company appointed Charles R. Howell IV as Chief
Executive Officer. Mr. Howell joined the Company in August 2002 as Chief
Operating Officer. He served most recently as President and Chief Executive
Officer of Corporate Airlines, Inc., a Nashville-based airline that he
co-founded in 1996. The Company plans to further strengthen management by hiring
a new senior financial officer and additional marketing personnel.

United and Frontier Code Sharing Relationships

Prior to May 1, 2001, the Company had been operating scheduled passenger service
exclusively as United Express under a cooperative marketing agreement with
United Airlines, Inc. ("United"). On February 1, 2001, the Company and United
entered into a three-year code sharing agreement, which became effective May 1,
2001. Under this agreement, the Company no longer operates under the name
"United Express"; rather, it operates under its own name but continues to use
the UA code for connecting service to United points beyond the Company's hubs.
The United code sharing agreement provides for use of United's flight designator
for Great Lakes flights connecting with United flights in Denver, Minneapolis,
Phoenix and Chicago, and permits the Company to enter into code sharing
agreements with certain other carriers.

On December 9, 2002, UAL, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including United, filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. United has
obtained an order from the bankruptcy court that allows United to perform under
its code sharing agreement with the Company. United has assumed but has the
right to reject the code sharing agreement until October 6, 2003, which is the
deadline to file a plan of reorganization. The deadline for acceptance of the
plan is December 5, 2003. Creditors must file proofs of claim against United by
May 12, 2003. The deadline does not apply to executory contracts such as the
Company's code sharing agreement, unless such contracts are rejected by United.
The deadlines may be extended by the bankruptcy court.

On May 3, 2001, the Company entered into a code sharing agreement with Frontier
Airlines, Inc. ("Frontier"), which was implemented July 9, 2001. The Frontier
agreement provides for the use of Frontier's flight designator on Great Lakes'
flights connecting with Frontier's flights in Denver. Accordingly, certain
flights to and from Denver carry both the United and Frontier designator as well
as the Great Lakes designator.

Markets

As of December 31, 2002, the Company operated 84 departures daily from Denver,
five departures daily from Minneapolis/St. Paul, three departures daily from
Phoenix and five departures daily from Chicago. Chicago service was discontinued
on February 28, 2003. The Company currently serves 41 airports in 11 states.

Essential Air Service Program

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (the "Deregulation Act") allowed airlines
great freedom to introduce, increase and generally reduce or eliminate service
to existing markets. Under the Essential Air Service program ("EAS"), which is
administered by the DOT, certain communities that received scheduled air service
prior to the passage of the Deregulation Act are guaranteed specified levels of
"essential air service." The DOT may authorize federal subsidies to compensate a
carrier providing essential air service in otherwise unprofitable or minimally
profitable markets. An airline serving a community that qualifies for essential
air services is required to give the DOT advance notice before it may terminate,
suspend or reduce service. Depending on the circumstances, the DOT may require
the continuation of existing service until a replacement carrier is found. EAS
rates are normally set for two-year contract periods for each city. Significant
fluctuations in passenger revenues as well as in fuel and other costs cause EAS
routes to become unprofitable during these two-year terms.

The DOT may request competitive proposals from other airlines at the end of the
contract period for EAS service to a particular city. Proposals, when requested,
are evaluated on, among other things, level of service provided, subsidy
requested, fitness of the applicant and comments from the communities served.

For the federal fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the EAS budgeted subsidy
funding level for the entire program was $50 million. In recognition of the
impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11, and the contractual obligation
to provide a fixed level of service to EAS communities by carriers receiving
subsidies, Congress authorized the DOT to increase subsidy rates to compensate
for reduced passenger revenues and higher level of expenses. Congress set the
EAS funding level at $113 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002
and at $113 million for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003.

As a result of these funding increases and the reduction of non-EAS service, the
Company's EAS revenues were approximately 36% of total revenue ($30.6 million)
in 2002, up from approximately 19% ($19.3 million) in 2001 and 11% ($14.9
million) in 2000. For 2003, total subsidy revenues are expected to be
approximately the same as the prior year due to the Company's filing for subsidy
support at additional cities, which are expected to replace subsidies lost with
the termination of service to and from Chicago. At March 31, 2003, the Company
served 25 essential air service communities on a subsidized basis. Of these, 12
were being served under closed rate orders and the remainder were in the process
of negotiation.

Aircraft

At December 31, 2002, the Company's fleet consisted of 39 Beechcraft 1900
aircraft and seven Embraer Brasilia passenger aircraft. Thirty-seven Beechcraft
1900D aircraft were available for use in passenger service, and two Beechcraft
1900C aircraft were being utilized exclusively for scheduled mail and freight
operations. The Beechcraft 1900D aircraft are pressurized, radar equipped and
offer a 300-mile per hour cruising speed for 19 passengers, plus cargo, with a
range of 850 miles. The Beechcraft 1900D aircraft is widely regarded by airlines
as an efficient and reliable aircraft for regional service. At December 31,
2002, the Company owned 36 and leased one of the passenger-configured Beechcraft
1900D aircraft.

On May 14, 2002, one owned Beechcraft 1900D and one leased Beechcraft 1900D,
along with spare parts inventory, were destroyed by fire in a maintenance hangar
owned by the Hall County Airport Authority and located in Grand Island,
Nebraska. The fire started during hangar door modification performed by an
outside contractor at the request of the Hall County Airport Authority. Of the
total insurance proceeds of $10.0 million received by the Company, $7.8 million
was applied to payment of the value of the leased aircraft and current and past
due debt and lease obligations due Raytheon. The balance was used by the Company
to replace spare parts inventory and tooling or was added to general corporate
funds.

Because of the reduction in demand for air service following the events of
September 11, the Company decided to retire seven of its Beechcraft 1900D
aircraft. In conjunction with the Restructuring Agreement, as more fully
described below, the Company will return the seven 1900D aircraft during 2003.
Also in conjunction with the Restructuring Agreement, the Company purchased nine
of the formerly leased 1900D aircraft which it elected to


                                       4

<PAGE>

retain in its fleet. The aggregate purchase price for the nine aircraft was
$22.5 million. Two 1900C aircraft were returned during 2002.

At December 31, 2002, two of the Company's seven Brasilia aircraft were in
scheduled service and the remainder were being used as spares and for limited
charter service. Four of the Brasilia aircraft are owned and three are leased
under terms ranging from nine months to 10 years. The 30 passenger Embraer
Brasilia aircraft are equipped with advanced avionics, have restrooms, are
staffed with a flight attendant and offer a 330-mile per hour cruising speed
with a range of 750 miles. The Company intends to increase the number of
Brasilia aircraft in scheduled service beginning in July 2003, as warranted by
passenger demand. The Company will return one Brasilia at the end of its lease
term in September 2003. Thereafter, the Company believes that there will be
greater opportunities to deploy these aircraft as the larger airlines reduce
service to small cities that are unprofitable for their regional jet aircraft.

The table below shows the number and type of aircraft operated by the Company on
January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2002.

As of December 31, 2002, the average age of the Company's aircraft was
approximately eight years and as of December 31, 2001, the average age of the
Company's aircraft was approximately seven years.

Restructuring Agreement with Raytheon

Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 and due to continuing
unfavorable economic conditions, the Company suffered substantial losses during
the fourth quarter of 2001 and the year 2002. These losses produced a
significant reduction in liquidity and rendered several aircraft surplus to the
Company's reduced level of operations. Because of these financial difficulties,
the Company missed contractual debt and lease payments during these periods and
made only minor payments on its debt and lease obligations. As a result, debt of
$111.0 million was in default and the Company was in arrears on lease payment
obligations which totaled $11.3 million at December 31, 2002, immediately prior
to the restructuring discussed below. Of these amounts, $106.0 million and $6.8
million, respectively, were owed to Raytheon.

On December 31, 2002, the Company finalized an agreement (the "Restructuring
Agreement") with Raytheon regarding lease and debt financing provided by
Raytheon for the Company's Beechcraft 1900C and 1900D aircraft fleet. The
Restructuring Agreement included provisions for:

     o    the issuance of 5,371,980 shares of the Company's Common Stock to
          Raytheon,

     o    the termination and modification of aircraft operating leases,

     o    the return of aircraft in satisfaction of indebtedness obligations,

     o    the modification of principal and interest rates for various aircraft
          financing promissory notes and

     o    a restructuring of certain non-aircraft indebtedness.

Return of Aircraft. The Company has agreed to return seven Beechcraft 1900D
aircraft to Raytheon during 2003 in exchange for the cancellation and
extinguishment of one operating lease and six promissory notes. Because the
Company will incur repair and refurbishment expenses during 2003 in order to
return the aircraft to Raytheon in good working order, the Company has
recognized a liability of $4 million for such expenditures. In addition, and in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 15 regarding the satisfaction of debt by
a transfer of assets, the Company has adjusted the net book value of the six
owned aircraft down to the aircrafts' total fair market value of $15 million,
and has recognized an impairment loss of $5.5 million. Upon return of the
aircraft to Raytheon in 2003, the Company expects to reduce its outstanding
aircraft debt and lease liabilities for these seven aircraft by $20.9 million
and record a gain from extinguishment of debt of $5.4 million.

Termination of Aircraft Operating Leases/Financed Purchase of Aircraft.
Operating leases for nine Beechcraft 1900D aircraft have been converted to
aircraft ownership with purchase money financing. The Company has recorded the
purchase of the nine aircraft at a total fair market value of $22.5 million with
a corresponding increase in long-term aircraft debt. Interest will accrue on the
unpaid principal balance of the new debt at the rate of LIBOR plus 375 basis
points per annum. Payments of principal and accrued interest are to be made in
120 monthly installments, with the amount of the monthly payment to be adjusted
quarterly to reflect any change in the LIBOR rate.

Restructured Financing Terms for Aircraft Promissory Notes. The Company obtained
amended debt financing for 21 Beechcraft 1900D aircraft promissory notes (the
"Restructured Aircraft Notes") in the amount of $52.5 million. Each of the
Restructured Aircraft Notes reflects an initial principal balance in the amount
of $2.5 million with interest to accrue on the unpaid principal balance at the
rate of LIBOR plus 375 basis points per annum. Payments of principal and accrued
interest are to be made in 120 monthly installments, with the amount of monthly
payment to be adjusted quarterly to reflect any change in the LIBOR rate. Total
cash payments for all of the Restructured Aircraft Notes is estimated to be
$68.1 million over the term of the notes.

Accounting for Refinancing of Aircraft Debt and Lease Obligations under SFAS 15.
Consistent with SFAS 15, the restructured financing terms for all 30 of the
Beechcraft 1900D aircraft debt and lease obligations discussed above (the "Old
Aircraft Debt") has been accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring. SFAS 15
states that in a troubled debt restructuring, the debtor shall account for the
effects of the restructuring prospectively from the time of restructuring and
shall not reduce the carrying amount of the existing debt unless the carrying
amount of the existing debt exceeds the total future cash payments of the new
debt under the restructured terms. Included in the carrying value of
restructured debt and lease obligations were $3.7 million of deferred gains and
other deferred credits. The effects of any changes in the face amount or
interest rate are to be amortized in future periods by reducing interest expense
to an effective interest rate which equates the net present value of the future
cash payments under the modified terms to the carrying value on the debtor's
books.

After increasing the Company's liabilities by $22.5 million for financing of the
Purchased Aircraft, the carrying value on the Company's books for the Old
Aircraft Debt was $101.3 million, while total future cash flows for the 30 new
and amended aircraft promissory notes (the "New Aircraft Debt") was estimated to
be $95.7 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 15, the amount of
the Company's long-term liabilities has been reduced by $5.6 million in order to
reflect the carrying value of the Old Aircraft Debt to an amount not more than
the estimated future cash flows of the New Aircraft Debt. The $20.7 million
difference between the $95.7 million restructured value of the Old Aircraft Debt
and the $75 million principal amount of the New Aircraft Debt will be amortized
as a reduction to the Company's interest expense over the next ten years.

Modification of Terms for Aircraft Operating Leases. Pursuant to the terms of
the Restructuring Agreement, $384,000 of pre-December 31, 2002 unpaid lease
payments on two Beechcraft 1900C aircraft operating leases has been
contractually extinguished and the Company negotiated a reduction in the monthly
lease payments for the two leases, which is anticipated to yield net cash flow
savings of $1.2 million over the next ten years. The $384,000 liability will
remain on the Company's books and be amortized over a period of 120 months.

Other Debt Restructuring Involving Partial Settlement Through Issuance of
Equity. $14.9 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest on various
non-aircraft debt was restructured into three new promissory notes (the


                                       6

<PAGE>

"Non-Aircraft Debt") with a total principal amount of $11.2 million and
estimated future cash payments of $15.2 million. In addition, the Company issued
5,371,980 shares of the Company's Common Stock to Raytheon, representing a 38.2%
interest in the Company's outstanding post-restructuring shares of Common Stock.

The restructuring of the Non-Aircraft Debt through the issuance of equity and
new debt obligations was accounted for in compliance with SFAS 15. The new debt
obligations were recorded at the carrying amount of the prior debt obligations,
less the fair value of the equity granted to Raytheon. The Company has
determined that, on the effective date of the Restructuring Agreement, the fair
market value of the equity interest granted to Raytheon was $2.1 million.
Accordingly, the Company has reduced $14.9 million of the Non-Aircraft Debt by
$2.1 million to a net carrying amount of $12.8 million, and has recorded an
increase of $2.1 million in shareholders' equity.

Board of Director Observer Rights. As further consideration for the concessions
granted by Raytheon in the Restructuring Agreement, the Company has granted
Raytheon observer rights for the Company's Board of Directors, but without any
right to vote or enter into any discussions at any Board of Directors meetings.

Registration Rights. The Company agreed to file a shelf registration statement
to permit Raytheon to resell the shares of Company Common Stock issued to it
under the Restructuring Agreement. The registration statement was to have been
filed by the date of this annual report, but has not yet been filed.

Independent Directors. The Restructuring Agreement provides that the Company
will appoint two new directors unaffiliated with the Company or Raytheon by
March 31, 2003. Mr. John Reardon has been appointed as a director under this
provision. The second director has not yet been appointed.

Mandatory Prepayments. Not later than the earlier of 90 days after the end of
the Company's fiscal year or the filing of the Company's Form 10-K for such
fiscal year, the Company is required to prepay amounts outstanding under the
Company's notes held by Raytheon in an amount equal to 50% of the "excess cash
flow" for that fiscal year. "Excess cash flow" means cash flow from the
Company's operations, less (a) capital expenditures, (b) payments of funded
indebtedness for or made during such fiscal year and (c) $250,000.

Anti-Dilution. The Restructuring Agreement gives Raytheon anti-dilution rights
with respect to certain issuances of Common Stock, rights to purchase Common
Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock.

As a result of continued declines in traffic and fare levels as well as slower
receipt of essential air service payments, the Company did not make its February
and March payments under the Restructuring Agreement to Raytheon and will not
make the payments due Raytheon in April 2003. In addition the Company is not in
compliance with certain financial covenants contained in that Agreement. On
April 14, 2003, Raytheon waived the foregoing requirements until June 15, 2003.

At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with its debt agreements or
had obtained amendments or short-term waivers from its lenders with respect to
any nonpayment of scheduled debt installments or noncompliance with financial
covenants. However, the Company cannot determine with a high degree of
confidence that it will be able to make the required payments or remain in
compliance with the agreements during the year 2003. Therefore the amount of
debt that by its terms would otherwise be due after one year is shown as
long-term obligations classified as current. In addition to the contractual
amounts due the lenders, the balance includes $22.3 million of additional
carrying amounts under FAS 15.

Other Financing

The Company is renegotiating agreements with three other creditors who provide
the financing for six of the Company's seven Brasilia aircraft. In August 2002,
the Company entered into a settlement with Finova Capital Corporation ("Finova")
with respect to an aircraft returned to Finova. As a part of that agreement, the
Company agreed to pay Finova a total of $727,589 with interest at 10% over a
period of 48 months. The Company retained the second aircraft leased from Finova
and agreed to pay Finova $10,000 per month from October 2002 through March 2003
and $15,000 per month from April 2003 until the end of the lease term on
September 30, 2003. For the period prior to September 30, 2003 the parties have
agreed to negotiate a settlement of amounts due under the lease agreement and
for unpaid rentals and return condition of the remaining aircraft.

At December 31, 2002, Great Lakes had three notes payable to the CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. ("CIT") with interest at 8.7% to 9.08%, totaling
$5.0 million for financing of three of its Brasilia aircraft, of which $214,000
was in arrears. In April 2003, the Company combined and modified the notes to
provide for reduced monthly payments through March 2008 at an interest rate of
LIBOR plus 275 basis points.


                                       7

<PAGE>

At December 31, 2002, the Company was in arrears on rental payments to Boeing
Capital Corporation ("Boeing") for lease of two Brasilia aircraft in the amount
of $3.4 million. Subsequent to year-end, the Company entered into a letter
agreement with Boeing, effective as of December 31, 2002, cancelling the unpaid
lease installments, reducing the monthly rental payments through the end of the
lease terms in 2013, requiring the Company to fund major overhauls in advance
and giving Boeing the right to terminate the leases at its option with six
months notice. Boeing will receive shares of redeemable preferred stock valued
at $4.5 million. The Company intends to file a Certificate of Designation
setting forth the terms of the redeemable preferred stock by April 30, 2003. The
parties will further document the terms and conditions of the lease
restructuring by that date.

Maintenance

The Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") mandates periodic inspection and
maintenance of commercial aircraft. The Company performs most maintenance and
inspection of its aircraft and engines (except engine overhaul) using its own
personnel. Heavy maintenance bases are located at Cheyenne, Wyoming; Huron,
South Dakota; and Grand Island, Nebraska. Line maintenance is also performed in
Denver, Colorado. Parts and supplies inventories are also maintained at these
locations to promote the mechanical dispatch reliability of the fleet. The
Company also maintains an inventory of spare engines and propellers for its
fleet to allow for minimal downtime during major overhauls. The Company
internally performs overhaul of selected aircraft components for its fleet.

In October 2001, Great Lakes became the first operator of Beechcraft 1900D
aircraft with Pratt & Whitney PT6A-67D engines to be authorized by the FAA to
maintain its engines on an "on-condition" basis. As part of the Restructuring
Agreement with Raytheon, the Company agreed that by April 30, 2003, it will
enter into an engine reserve funding plan with a third party vendor that covers
the next complete overhaul performed on each 1900D engine after the engine
completes the current refurbishment cycle.

Yield Management

The Company closely monitors its inventory and pricing of available seats with
yield management systems. These systems enable the Company's revenue control
analysts to examine the Company's past traffic and pricing trends and to
estimate the optimal number of seats made available for sale at various fares.
The analysts then monitor each flight to adjust seat allocations and booking
levels, with the objective of maximizing the total revenue for each flight.

Marketing

The Company's services are marketed primarily by means of listings in
computerized reservation systems and the Official Airline Guide, and through
direct contact with travel agencies and corporate travel departments. The
Company's promotional programs emphasize the Company's close affiliation with
its code sharing partners and the opportunity for the Company's passengers to
participate in United's "Mileage Plus" frequent flyer program.

Competition

The Company competes for passenger traffic primarily with regional and major air
carriers and ground transportation. It may also compete with other regional
carriers and smaller carriers to provide Essential Air Service and receive
subsidies for providing service to small communities. The Company's competition
from other air carriers varies from location to location and, in certain areas,
comes from regional and major carriers who serve the same destinations as the
Company but through different hub and spoke systems. The domestic airline
industry has undergone major structural changes since the enactment of the
Deregulation Act. Deregulation has made possible the rapid entry of competitors
into the Company's markets, and competitors are able to adjust fares rapidly to
improve their competitive position. The Company could experience increased
competition from existing competitors or from new entrants on one or more of the
Company's routes.

Almost all markets are subject to a high degree of price competition both from
established carriers and low fare jet carriers. The Company believes, however,
that its ability to compete in its market areas is strengthened by its code
sharing relationships with United and Frontier at Denver. The Company competes
with other airlines by offering


                                       8

<PAGE>

frequent flights, flexible schedules and competitive fares. In addition, the
Company's competitive position benefits from the large number of participants in
United's "Mileage Plus" frequent flyer program. These participants receive
mileage credits on flights operated by Great Lakes under its own identity and on
connecting flights with United. They may also use their awards to travel on
United or Great Lakes flights.

Fuel

The Company has not experienced difficulty with fuel availability and expects to
continue to be able to obtain fuel in quantities sufficient to meet its future
requirements. The Company contracts directly with refiners for the purchase of
portions of its fuel. Standard industry contracts generally do not provide
protection against fuel price increases and do not ensure availability of
supply. Accordingly, an increase in the cost of fuel, if not accompanied by an
equivalent increase in passenger revenues, could have a material adverse impact
on the Company's future operating results. During 2002, the Company's average
price of fuel including taxes and into plane service fees was $1.11 per gallon
as compared to $1.25 in 2001 and $1.26 in 2000. At current rates of consumption,
a one cent increase or decrease in the per gallon price of fuel will increase or
decrease expense by approximately $115,000 annually.

Employees

At March 31, 2003, the Company had 674 full-time and 222 part-time active
employees as compared to 762 full-time and 174 part-time active employees at
December 31, 2001, as follows:

The Company's pilots are represented by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. The Company's agreement with the pilots became amendable October 30,
2000, and the Company and the union are negotiating to achieve an agreement. The
members of the union have authorized a strike at some future date if an
agreement is not reached. However, before any work stoppage can occur, the
Federal Mediation Board must release the participants to self help, followed by
a 30-day cooling off period. The Company's flight attendants are also
represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the Company's
agreement with the flight attendants became amendable April 1, 2002.
Negotiations with the flight attendants are inactive at the present time.

The Company's mechanics and maintenance clerks are represented by the
International Association of Machinists. The Company's agreement with the
mechanics becomes amendable November 1, 2005, and the Company's agreement with
the maintenance clerks became amendable March 1, 2002. Negotiations with the
maintenance clerks are inactive at the present time.

Charter and Freight Service

The Company uses its Beechcraft and Brasilia aircraft to provide charter
services to private individuals, corporations and athletic teams. The Company
also carries freight, mail and small packages on most of its scheduled flights
and has two Beechcraft 1900C aircraft devoted to providing service under a
subcontract for carriage of mail for the U.S. Postal Service. Revenues from the
Company's charter flights and freight and mail


                                       9

<PAGE>

deliveries were 3.8%, 4.1% and 3.8% of the Company's total revenues for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Regulation

In accordance with the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
amended (the "1958 Act"), the Company is an air carrier subject to regulation by
the DOT, primarily with respect to economic matters, and is also subject to
regulation by the FAA with respect to certain safety related matters.

The Company holds an air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA
pursuant to Part 121 of the FAA's regulations. The Company, as a commuter air
carrier, is licensed under Part 298 of the Economic Regulations of the DOT. The
Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the FAA with respect to its aircraft
maintenance and operations, including equipment, ground facilities, dispatch,
communications, training, weather observation, flight personnel and other
matters affecting air safety. To ensure compliance with its regulations, the FAA
requires airlines to obtain an operating certificate and operations
specifications for the particular aircraft and types of operations conducted by
the carrier, all of which are subject to suspension or revocation for cause.

The Deregulation Act eliminated many regulatory constraints so that airlines
became free to set fares and, with limited exceptions, to establish domestic
routes without the necessity of seeking government approval. The DOT is still
authorized to establish consumer protection regulations; to prohibit certain
pricing practices; to mandate conditions of carriage; and to make ongoing
determinations of a carrier's fitness, willingness and ability to properly and
lawfully provide air transportation. The DOT also has the power to bring
proceedings to enforce its regulations under the 1958 Act and seek penalties,
including the assessment of civil penalties, the revocation of operating
authority and criminal sanctions.

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act requires the adoption of certain
security measures by airlines and airports, including screening of passengers
and baggage. The new security measures are being partially funded by a $2.50 per
flight segment tax on tickets. The Company is responsible for certain security
costs above this level.

The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications
Commission regarding the use of its radio facilities. Local governments and
authorities in certain markets have adopted regulations governing various
aspects of aircraft operations, including noise abatement, curfews and use of
airport facilities. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all such
regulations.

Insurance

The Company carries the types and amounts of insurance required by the DOT and
customary in the regional airline industry, including coverage for public
liability, property damage, aircraft loss or damage, baggage and cargo liability
and workers' compensation.

As a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, aviation insurers have
significantly increased premiums for all aviation coverage while dramatically
reducing the amount of coverage available for war-risk occurrences. In response
to the reduction in coverage, the Stabilization Act provided U.S. air carriers
with the option to purchase certain war-risk liability insurance from the U.S.
government on an interim basis at rates that are more favorable than those
available in the private market. The Company has purchased this coverage and
anticipates renewing it for as long as the coverage is available from the U.S.
government. The airlines and insurance industries, together with the U.S. and
other governments, are continuing to evaluate both the cost and options for
providing coverage of aviation insurance. The Company anticipates that it will
follow industry practices with respect to sources of insurance. The Company
believes that its insurance is adequate as to amounts and risks covered. There
can be no assurance, however, that the limits of the Company's insurance will be
sufficient to cover any catastrophic loss.

          Risk Factors Relating to the Company and the Airline Industry

Dependence on Relationship with United

The Company believes approximately 70% of Great Lakes passenger traffic
currently connects with United flights. As a result of the Company's
relationship with United, the Company's business is sensitive to events and
risks affecting United. If adverse events affect United's business, the
Company's business is also adversely affected. Such events include the outcome
of United's bankruptcy reorganization, changes in United's business plan or
model, employee strikes or job actions, significant curtailment of services or
terrorist events. However, to the extent that the Company is successful in
developing its own identity on its operating system and is successful in
developing its code sharing relationship with Frontier, it will reduce its
dependence on United and mitigate the effects of such adverse events if they
relate to United only.

Terrorist Events

The Company is sensitive to items related to the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks, such as the impact of additional airline and security charges on
Company costs, customer demand for travel, cost and availability of war risk and
other aviation insurance, including the federal government's provision of third
party war-risk coverage and the possibility of additional terrorist events which
could cause further customer aversion to air travel.

War

War or other military action by the United States or others could have a
significant effect on passenger traffic.

Dependence on Essential Air Service Revenues

In 2002, 36.2% of the Company's revenues were received as EAS subsidies. EAS
subsidies are expected to remain a significant portion of the Company's revenues
in 2003 and future years. Changes in DOT policies with regard to payment of
subsidies and reduction or loss of subsidies as a result of competitive bidding
may have a substantial impact on the Company.

Effect of General Economic Conditions

The airline industry is significantly affected by general economic conditions.
During recent recessions, most airlines reduced fares in an effort to increase
traffic. The Company does not hedge its fuel purchasing costs. Economic and
competitive conditions in the airline industry have contributed to a number of
bankruptcies and liquidations among airlines. A worsening of current economic
conditions, or an extended period of recession nationally or regionally, would
have a materially adverse effect on the Company's operations.

Fuel Costs

Fuel is a major component of operating expense for all airlines. The Company's
cost of fuel varies directly with market conditions, and the Company has no
guaranteed long-term sources of supply. The Company intends generally to follow
industry trends by raising fares in response to significant fuel price
increases. However, the Company's ability to pass on increased fuel costs
through fare increases may be limited by economic and competitive conditions.
Accordingly, a reduction in the availability or an increase in the price of fuel
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's cash flow from operations
and profitability.

Weather

The Company passenger traffic and costs can be directly impacted by adverse
weather conditions and air traffic control related constraints.

Restructuring Agreement

Payments under the Restructuring Agreement signed on December 31, 2002 with
Raytheon are closely aligned with future forecasted cash flows. If the Company
fails to achieve those cash flows, it will be unable to meet its obligations
under that and other agreements. This could result in the demand for immediate
payment of all obligations by the Company's creditors.

Control by Principal Stockholders

Raytheon, the Company's principal creditor, owns approximately 38.2% of the
outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. Raytheon and the Company are
parties to a Restructuring Agreement. See "Business-Restructuring Agreement with
Raytheon."

Mr. Douglas G. Voss, Chairman of the Board of the Company beneficially owns or
controls approximately 38.3% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common
stock. On October 22, 1996, Mr. Voss transferred approximately one-half of the
shares of the Company's common stock owned by him to his ex-spouse, Ms. Gayle R.
Brandt, pursuant to a Marital Dissolution Stipulation and Property Settlement.
Ms. Brandt has granted Mr. Voss an Irrevocable Proxy to vote such securities
until June 28, 2010. Accordingly, Mr. Voss and Raytheon are in a position to
control the management and affairs of the Company.

Noncompliance with the Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirements

The Company's Common Stock was de-listed from The Nasdaq SmallCap Market on
August 14, 2002. As a result of the delisting, the Company's Common Stock has
become subject to certain rules of the SEC relating to "penny stocks." These
rules require broker-dealers to make a suitability determination for purchasers
and to receive the purchaser's prior written consent for a purchase transaction,
thus restricting the ability to purchase or sell the securities in the open
market. Trading of the Company's Common Stock is conducted on the OTC Bulletin
Board, which was established for securities that do not meet Nasdaq listing
requirements. Consequently, trading the Company's Common Stock may be more
difficult, because of lower trading volumes, transaction delays and reduced
security analyst and news media coverage of the Company. These factors could
also contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for
the Company's Common Stock.

Item 2. PROPERTIES

At December 31, 2002, the Company leased gate and ramp facilities at 40 airports
where ticketing, passenger loading and unloading are handled by Company
personnel. Payments to airport authorities for ground facilities are based on a
number of factors, including the amount of space used and flight volume. The
Company also leases aircraft hangar space for maintenance operations at three of
the locations it serves.

Effective January 1, 2000, the Company entered into a lease in Cheyenne,
Wyoming, for approximately 42,000 square feet of space for administration and
maintenance needs. In 2000, the Company constructed an additional leased
facility in Cheyenne. This facility is approximately 54,000 square feet and is
used for administrative, flight operations, maintenance offices, maintenance and
hangar space.

The Company believes that it has adequate facilities for the conduct of its
current and planned operations.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On February 27, 2002, Finova Capital Corporation ("Finova") filed suit against
the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. No.
Civ. 02-0362 PHX SMM. Finova alleged that the Company breached two airplane
lease agreements and sought damages, costs and attorney's fees. On August 1,
2002, Finova and the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Covenant
Not to Execute on one of the aircraft. On November 1, 2002, Finova and the
Company entered into a Deferral Agreement which provides for the withdrawal of
the suit and payment of $10,000 per month from October 2002 through March 2003
and $15,000 per month from


                                       12

<PAGE>

April 2003 until the end of the lease term on September 30, 2003 for the second
aircraft. Finova and the Company have agreed that prior to the end of the lease

(1)  "Available seat miles" or "ASMs" represent the number of seats available
     for passengers in scheduled flights multiplied by the number of scheduled
     miles those seats are flown.

(2)  "Revenue passenger miles" or "RPMs" represent the number of miles flown by
     revenue passengers.

(3)  "Passenger load factor" represents the percentage of seats filled by
     revenue passengers and is calculated by dividing revenue passenger miles by
     available seat miles.

(4)  "Break-even passenger load factor" represents the percentage of available
     seat miles which must be flown by revenue passengers at the average yield
     (net of commissions and fees) for airline operations to break even.

(5)  "Average yield per revenue passenger mile" represents the average passenger
     revenue received for each mile a revenue passenger is carried.

(6)  "Operating cost per available seat mile" represents operating expenses
     divided by available seat miles.

(7)  "Average passenger fare" represents passenger revenue divided by the number
     of revenue passengers carried.

(8)  "Average passenger trip length" represents revenue passenger miles divided
     by the number of revenue passengers carried.

The Company began providing air charter service in 1979, and has provided
scheduled passenger service in the Upper Midwest since 1981. Beginning in April
1992, the Company operated as a United Express carrier under a cooperative
marketing agreement with United, which terminated on April 30, 2001. The Company
now operates under its own name and as a code sharing partner with United and
Frontier. As of March 1, 2003 the Company provided passenger service to 41
airports in 11 states with 1,433 scheduled departures each week.

Comparison of 2002 to 2001

Passenger Revenues: Passenger revenues and revenue passenger miles decreased
34.8% and 33.1% respectively, from 2001. Although the Company discontinued
service to four cities during the year the decrease was largely due to the
continued industry wide decline in passenger traffic following the September 11
terrorist attacks.

Public Service Revenues: Public service revenues collected through the Essential
Air Service program increased 58.8% in 2002 compared to 2001. As a result of the
September 11 terrorist attacks, the Department of Transportation, in Order
number 2002-2-13, entitled "Order Authorizing Emergency Essential Air Service
Payments," provided for an immediate increase in all subsidized rates effective
retroactively to October 1, 2001. This order also began the process of
renegotiating all of the Company's subsidy contracts as of October 1, 2001 to
recognize the effects of the September 11 attacks on airline operations,
specifically higher insurance costs and lower passenger revenues.

Other Revenues: Other revenues declined 23.0% to $3.4 million in 2002. Freight
revenue decreased as a result of reduced capacity and increased security
requirements governing the acceptance of air freight following the September 11
terrorist acts. Charter revenues were down as a result of the non-renewal of
various university charter contracts.

Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses decreased 19.3%, or $21.7 million,
in 2002 compared to 2001. Cost per ASM decreased 3.5% from 2001 to 25.2 cents
per ASM. The suspension of service following the September 11 terrorist attacks
and the ensuing reduced schedule had a significant impact upon direct operating
costs.

Salaries, wages, and benefits decreased 16.9% to $25.9 million from 2001 as a
result of reductions in staffing levels, pay rates, hours worked and the closing
of service to and from some cities.

Aircraft fuel expense was down 28.0% in 2002. The decrease is attributed to the
continued flight schedule reductions following the September 11 terrorist
attacks. The Company benefited from flat average fuel costs through the first
three quarters. Rising fuel costs in the fourth quarter were offset by the usual
seasonal reduction in scheduled operations. The average per gallon rate
decreased 11.2% to $1.11 for the year.

Aircraft maintenance, materials and component repair expense was 3.6 cents per
ASM for both 2002 and 2001. The reduction in expense to $12.7 million
corresponds with the reduction of ASMs.

Commissions decreased 65.3% to $0.9 million in 2002 from $2.5 million in 2001 as
a result of lower travel agency commission rates, decreased gross revenues and
increasing direct sales. Following a majority of the airline industry, the
Company discontinued paying commissions to travel agents on tickets sold after
June 12, 2002.

Depreciation expenses were largely flat due to the Company's owned aircraft
fleet remaining substantially unchanged during the year from 2001.

Aircraft lease expense decreased 14.1% in 2002 to $7.5 million from $8.7 million
in 2001 as a result of the termination of a lease of one EMB-120 and two Beech
1900D aircraft. As of March 31, 2002, one of two EMB-120 aircraft leased from
Finova Corporation was returned to the lessor, and the lease was terminated. At
January 1, 2002, the Company was leasing one aircraft, a Beech 1900D, from an
affiliated company. Effective March 31, 2002, the aircraft was returned to the
lessor. On May 14, 2002, a leased Beech 1900D was one of two aircraft destroyed
in a hangar fire, and lease rentals ceased May 31, 2002. The second aircraft
destroyed in the fire was a Company-owned Beech 1900D aircraft.

Other rentals and landing fees decreased 9.2% in 2002. Landing fees were reduced
in conjunction with a corresponding decrease in total landings.


                                       18

<PAGE>

Other operating expenses decreased 23.6% in 2002 to $18.1 million from $23.7
million in 2001, representing a 0.5 cent per ASM reduction in cost. The decrease
is primarily due to the elimination of certain fees associated with the former
United Express agreement, lower levels of operations and other actions that were
taken to reduce costs.

The decrease in interest expense from $9.9 million in 2001 to $6.6 million in
2002 was primarily due to reduced interest rates as the majority of the
Company's fleet is financed at variable interest rates. Also, one Company-owned
Beech 1900D with debt of $3.2 million was destroyed in a hangar fire. In
addition, on April 30, 2002 the Company fully paid and terminated its line of
credit with Coast Business Credit.

Income Tax Expense (benefit): The realization of any benefits remains
substantially in doubt as the Company continues in its loss carry forward
position.

Gain on Insurance Recovery: The Company recorded a gain of $1.4 million in
connection with receipt of insurance proceeds for two aircraft destroyed in a
hangar fire. See "Busines--Aircraft" above.

Impairment of Assets and Gain on Extinguishment of Debt: The Company recognized
an impairment loss of $5.5 million and recognized a gain on extinguishment of
debt of $5.6 million in connection with the recording of the Restructuring
Agreement with Raytheon. See "--Restructuring Agreement with Raytheon Aircraft
Credit Corporation."

Comparison of 2001 to 2000

Passenger Revenues: Passenger revenues and revenue passenger miles decreased
30.6% and 24.5%, respectively, from 2000. As the Company continued to shift its
operational focus to the Denver hub, service was discontinued at a total of 10
cities serving Chicago O'Hare Airport by the end of the second quarter of 2001.
Service was also discontinued at Meigs Lakefront Airport in Chicago during
August 2001. These closings resulted in a 47% reduction in total departures for
the Chicago market. The closing of service to and from these cities contributed
to a reduction in yield as the traffic mix was primarily business oriented. The
suspension of air service following the terrorist attacks of September 11 and a
subsequent 39% decrease in passengers flown during the fourth quarter of 2001 as
compared to the first and second quarters further contributed to the decline in
revenue for 2001.

Public Service Revenues: Public service revenues collected through the EAS
program increased 29.6% in 2001 compared to 2000. While EAS service was
discontinued at Mattoon, Illinois; Ottumwa, Iowa; and Yankton, South Dakota;
service was added at Page, Arizona and Moab and Vernal, Utah. The Company
further negotiated and became eligible to collect subsidy for service to Pierre,
South Dakota.

As a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Department of
Transportation, in Order number 2002-2-13, entitled "Order Authorizing Emergency
Essential Air Service Payments," provided for an immediate increase in all
subsidized rates effective retroactively to October 1, 2001. This order also
began the process of renegotiating all of the Company's subsidy contracts as of
October 1, 2001 to recognize the effects of the September 11 attacks on airline
operations, specifically higher insurance costs and lower passenger revenues.
These renegotiated rates superseded the interim rates through the normal end of
the contract period.

Other Revenues: Other revenues declined 33.9% in 2001. Freight revenue decreased
as a result of reduced capacity and increased security requirements governing
the acceptance of air freight following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
Charter revenues were down as a result of the cancellation of various university
charters following the highly publicized fatal accident in January 2001,
involving another charter operator and the Oklahoma State University basketball
team. These revenue losses were partially offset by an increase in December
2001, of the per pound rate paid by the U.S. Postal Service for mail carried on
the Company's air mail routes.

Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses decreased 15.5%, or $20.6 million
in 2001 compared to 2000. Cost per ASM increased 3.5% over 2000 to 26.1 cents
per ASM. The suspension of service following the September 11 terrorist attacks
and the ensuing reduced schedule had a significant impact upon direct operating
costs.

Salaries, wages, and benefits decreased $4.0 million from 2000 as a result of
employee furloughs, pay reductions, and pay freezes following the September 11
terrorist attacks.

Aircraft fuel expense was down 18.6% in 2001 on flat average fuel costs of $1.25
per gallon. Overall consumption was down 18.2% in 2001 as a result of reduced
flying.

Aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs showed a 13.5% decrease in 2001 from
an overall reduction in flights year over year and the reduction of utilization
of the Company's aircraft.


                                       19

<PAGE>

Commissions were down 40.9% in 2001 because of a corresponding decrease in
passenger revenue, further reductions in the number of tickets purchased through
travel agencies and continuing decreases in commission rates.

Depreciation and amortization and aircraft rental expenses were largely flat due
to the Company's aircraft fleet composition remaining unchanged from 2000.

Other rentals and landing fees decreased 18.5% in 2001 with no net change in
cost per ASM. Other rentals including terminal facilities expense at various
airports decreased as a result of the discontinuation of service in 15 markets.
Landing fees were reduced in conjunction with a corresponding decrease in total
landings.

Other operating expenses decreased 21.3% from 2000, representing a 0.2 cent per
ASM reduction in cost. The reduction was largely the result of the termination
of the United Airlines / United Express marketing agreement and its associated
franchise and marketing fees. Ongoing cost cutting efforts further contributed
to the reduction in expenses.

The Company recognized a grant of $1.9 million from the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by
President Bush on September 22, 2001.

Income Tax Expense (benefit): The realization of any benefits from the Company's
net operating loss carry forward is substantially in doubt.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2002 was
$358,000, down from $1.5 million at December 31, 2001. The Company had negative
working capital of $147.2 million at December 31, 2002.

While the Company experienced a net loss of $10.8 million for the year 2002,
cash of $6.1 million was provided by operating activities primarily as a result
of non cash depreciation and amortization charges of $7.0 million and increases
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities which includes the non-payment of
interest and the deferral of lease payments totaling $8.3 million. Recording of
the Restructuring Agreement as of December 31, 2002, included a charge for
impairment of assets and other property of $5.5 million that was offset by a
non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $5.6 million.

The $6.1 million of cash provided from operations and the $2.2 million proceeds
from the hangar fire insurance recovery were the primary sources of funds used
to retire a working capital line of credit balance of $4.6 million and reduce
notes payable and long-term debt by $4.4 million.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 and due to the continued
downturn in the economy, the Company suffered substantial losses during the
fourth quarter of 2001 and the year 2002. These losses produced a significant
reduction in liquidity as well as rendering a number of aircraft surplus to the
Company's reduced level of operations. Because of these financial difficulties,
the Company missed contractual debt and lease payments during these periods and
made only minor payments on its debt and lease obligations. As a result, debt of
$111.0 million was in default and the Company was in arrears on lease payment
obligations which totaled $11.3 million at December 31, 2002, immediately prior
to the restructuring discussed below. Of these amounts, $106.0 million and $6.8
million, respectively, were owed to Raytheon.

Restructuring Agreement with Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation. On December
31, 2002, the Company finalized an agreement (the Restructuring Agreement) with
Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation (Raytheon) regarding lease and debt
financing provided by Raytheon for the Company's Beechcraft 1900C and 1900D
aircraft fleet. The complex nature of the Restructuring Agreement included
separate provisions for i) the termination and/or modification of aircraft
operating leases, ii) the return of aircraft in satisfaction of indebtedness
obligations, iii) the modification of principal and interest rates for various


                                       20

<PAGE>

aircraft financing promissory notes, and iv) a restructuring of other
indebtedness by means of an issuance of new debt instruments and equity. For
purposes of accounting for the Restructuring Agreement, the Company has
identified the major types of transactions contained within the Restructuring
Agreement in order to more accurately apply the appropriate accounting treatment
to each type of transaction. Transactions involving the termination and/or
modification of aircraft operating leases have been accounted for pursuant to
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting
for Leases (SFAS 13), while the restructuring of indebtedness owed by the
Company to Raytheon has been accounted for in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, Accounting for Debtors and
Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings (SFAS 15). Accordingly, the major
elements of the Restructuring Agreement and the Company's accounting treatment
of those transactions are as follows:

(a)      Return of Aircraft

The Company has agreed to return seven Beechcraft 1900D aircraft to Raytheon
during 2003 in exchange for the cancellation and extinguishment of one operating
lease and six promissory notes. Because the Company will incur repair and
refurbishment expenses during 2003 in order to return the aircraft to Raytheon
in good working order, the Company has recognized a liability of $4 million for
such expenditures. In addition, and in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 15
regarding the satisfaction of debt by a transfer of assets, the Company has
adjusted the net book value of the six owned aircraft down to the aircrafts'
fair market value of $15 million, and has recognized an impairment loss of $5.5
million. Upon return of the aircraft to Raytheon in 2003, the Company expects to
reduce its outstanding aircraft debt and lease liabilities for these seven
aircraft by $20.9 million and record a gain from exinguishment of debt of $5.4
million.

(b)      Termination of Aircraft Operating Leases/Financed Purchase of Aircraft

Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, operating leases for nine
Beechcraft 1900D aircraft (the "Purchased Aircraft") have been converted to
aircraft ownership with purchase money financing. The Company has recorded the
purchase of the nine aircraft at a total fair market value of $22.5 million with
a corresponding increase in long-term aircraft debt. Interest will accrue on the
unpaid principal balance of the new debt at the rate of LIBOR plus 375 basis
points per annum. Payments of principal and accrued interest are to be made in
120 monthly installments, with the amount of the monthly payment to be adjusted
quarterly to reflect any change in the LIBOR rate.

(c)      Restructured Financing Terms for Aircraft Promissory Notes

The Company obtained amended debt financing for 21 Beechcraft 1900D aircraft
promissory notes (the "Restructured Aircraft Notes") in the amount of $52.5
million. Each of the Restructured Aircraft Notes reflects an initial principal
balance in the amount of $2.5 million with interest to accrue on the unpaid
principal balance at the rate of LIBOR plus 375 basis points per annum. Payments
of principal and accrued interest are to be made in 120 monthly installments,
with the amount of monthly payment to be adjusted quarterly to reflect any
change in the LIBOR rate. Total cash payments for all of the Restructured
Aircraft Notes is estimated to be $68.1 million over the term of the notes.

(d)      Accounting for Refinancing of Aircraft Debt and Lease Obligations under
         SFAS 15

Consistent with SFAS 15, the restructured financing terms for all 30 of the
Beechcraft 1900D aircraft debt and lease obligations discussed in (b) and (c)
above (the "Old Aircraft Debt") has been accounted for as a troubled debt
restructuring. SFAS 15 states that in a troubled debt restructuring, the debtor
shall account for the effects of the restructuring prospectively from the time
of restructuring and shall not reduce the carrying amount of the existing debt
unless the carrying amount of the existing debt exceeds the total future cash
payments of the new debt under the restructured terms. Included in the carrying
value of restructured debt and lease obligations were $3.7 million of deferred
gains and other deferred credits. The effects of any changes in the face amount
or interest rate are to be amortized in future periods by reducing interest
expense to an effective interest rate which equates the net present value of the
future cash payments under the modified terms to the carrying value on the
debtor's books.



                                       21

<PAGE>

After increasing the Company's liabilities by $22.5 million for financing of the
Purchased Aircraft, the carrying value on the Company's books for the Old
Aircraft Debt was $101.3 million, while total future cash flows for the thirty
(30) new and amended aircraft promissory notes (the "New Aircraft Debt") was
estimated to be $95.7 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 15, the
amount of the Company's long-term liabilities has been reduced by $5.6 million
in order to reflect the carrying value of the Old Aircraft Debt to an amount not
more than the estimated future cash flows of the New Aircraft Debt. The $20.7
million difference between the $95.7 million restructured value of the Old
Aircraft Debt and the $75 million principal amount of the New Aircraft Debt will
be amortized as a reduction to the Company's interest expense over the next ten
years.

(e)      Modification of Terms for Aircraft Operating Leases

Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, $384,000 of pre-12/31/02
unpaid lease payments on two Beechcraft 1900C aircraft operating leases has been
contractually extinguished and the Company negotiated a reduction in the monthly
lease payments for the two leases, which is anticipated to yield net cash flow
savings of $1.2 million over the next ten years. The $384,000 liability will
remain on the Company's books and be amortized over a period of 120 months.

(f)      Other Debt Restructuring Involving Partial Settlement Through Issuance
         of Equity

$14.9 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest on various
non-aircraft debt was restructured into three new promissory notes (the
"Non-Aircraft Debt") with a total principal amount of $11.2 million and
estimated future cash payments of $15.2 million. In addition, the Company issued
5,371,980 shares of the Company's common stock to Raytheon, representing a 38.2%
interest in the Company's outstanding post-restructuring shares of common stock.

The restructuring of the Non-Aircraft Debt through the issuance of equity and
new debt obligation(s) was accounted for in compliance with SFAS 15. The new
debt obligations were recorded at the carrying amount of the prior debt
obligation(s), less the fair value of the equity granted to Raytheon. The
Company has determined that, on the effective date of the Restructuring
Agreement, the fair market value of the equity interest granted to Raytheon was
$2.1 million. Accordingly, the Company has reduced $14.9 million of Non-Aircraft
Debt by $2.1 million to a net carrying amount of $12.8 million, and has recorded
an increase of $2.1 million in shareholders' equity.

(g)      Board of Director Observer Rights

As further consideration for the concessions granted by Raytheon in the
Restructuring Agreement, the Company has granted Raytheon observer rights for
the Company's Board of Directors, but without any right to vote or enter into
any discussions at any Board of Directors meetings.

As a result of continued declines in traffic and fare levels as well as slower
receipt of essential air service payments, the Company did not make its February
and March payments under the Restructuring Agreement to Raytheon and will not
make the payments due Raytheon in April 2003. In addition the Company is not in
compliance with certain financial covenants contained in that Agreement. On
April 14, 2003, Raytheon waived the foregoing requirements until June 15, 2003.

Other Financing

The Company has also renegotiated agreements with three other creditors who
provide the financing for six of the Company's seven Brasilia aircraft. In
August 2002, the Company entered into a settlement with Finova Capital
Corporation ("Finova") with respect to an aircraft returned to Finova. As a part
of that agreement, the Company agreed to pay Finova a total of $727,589 with
interest at 10% over a period of 48 months. The Company retained


                                       23

<PAGE>

the second aircraft leased from Finova and agreed to pay Finova $10,000 per
month from October 2002 through March 2003 and $15,000 per month from April 2003
until the end of the lease term on September 30, 2003. For the period prior to
September 30, 2003 the parties have agreed to negotiate a settlement of amounts
due under the lease agreement and for unpaid rentals and return condition of the
remaining aircraft.

At December 31, 2002, the Company was in arrears on rental payments to Boeing
Capital Corporation ("Boeing") for lease of two Brasilia aircraft in the amount
of $3.4 million. Subsequent to year-end, the Company entered into a letter
agreement with Boeing, effective as of December 31, 2002, to cancel the unpaid
lease installments, to reduce the monthly rental payments through the end of the
lease terms in 2013, requiring the Company to fund major overhauls in advance
and giving Boeing the right to terminate the leases at its option with six
months notice. Boeing will receive shares of redeemable preferred stock valued
at $4.5 million. The Company intends to file a Certificate of Designation
setting forth the terms of the redeemable preferred stock by April 30, 2003. The
parties will further document the terms and conditions of the lease
restructuring by that date.

At December 31, 2002, Great Lakes had three notes payable to The CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. ("CIT") Corporation with interest at 8.7% to
9.08%, totaling $5.0 million for financing of three of its Brasilia aircraft, of
which $214,000 was in arrears. In April 2003, the notes were combined and
modified to provide for reduced monthly payments through March 2008 at an
interest rate of LIBOR plus 275 basis points.

Debt Service

The restructured financing agreements with creditors are based in part on a
financial model that contains forecasts of expected revenues, expenses and cash
flows. Payments to creditors are closely aligned with expected cash flows, and
any shortfall in these cash flows would have an immediate effect on the
Company's ability to meet its payment obligations under its debt restructuring
agreements. There are significant uncertainties regarding the Company's ability
to achieve the required cash flows because of the unknown outcome of United's
attempt to reorganize under its bankruptcy filing, volatility of fuel prices,
unknown effects of the Iraq conflict and general economic conditions. The
foregoing uncertainties are outside the control of the Company, and the Company
has no alternative source of funding or financing to provide sufficient cash to
continue operations if the Company does not achieve its forecasted cash flows.
If the Company is unable to make the payments required under the restructuring
agreements, it will be required to attempt to renegotiate its payment schedule
with its current creditors. There can be no assurance that creditors will be
willing or able to renegotiate such payments.

At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with its debt agreements or
had obtained amendments or short-term waivers from its lenders with respect to
any nonpayment of scheduled debt installments or noncompliance with financial
covenants. However, the Company cannot determine with a high degree of
confidence that it will be able to make the required payments or remain in
compliance with the agreements during the year 2003. Therefore the amount of
debt that by its terms would otherwise be due after one year is shown as
long-term obligations classified as current.

As a result of the significant uncertainties concerning the Company's ability to
achieve the results contained in its financial model and to pay its obligations
as they become due, there is substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis which assumes continuity of operations and
realization of assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if the
Company were forced to discontinue operations.

The Company's financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 1 to the financial
statements, the Company has suffered significant losses in the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and had liabilities in excess of assets at December
31, 2002. The auditor's report dated March 17, 2003 on the Company's financial
statements states that these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, brought about an immediate reduction of
passenger traffic as well as additional costs. The Company adjusted its level of
operations to better match the available traffic along with retiming its
schedules to align them with United's reduced capacity at Denver.

Since September 11, 2001, the Company has aggressively reduced its operations to
match as closely as possible its service to available traffic and the reduced
level of capacity by United and has instituted an aggressive cost control


                                       24

<PAGE>

program. It has also concentrated on maintaining and expanding its service in
markets eligible for government subsidy. At the end of 2002, approximately 54%
of its operations were in markets eligible for subsidy support.

Essential Air Service: The DOT also recognized the change in economics as a
result of September 11 for carriers providing service to Essential Air Service
cities and ordered the renegotiation of all subsidy contracts retroactive to
October 1, 2001. DOT Order 2002-2-13 provided for the adjustment of subsidy
payments to recognize lower levels of passenger revenues and compensate carriers
for higher levels of costs such as insurance and security.

Contracts with the DOT for providing Essential Air Service, while nominally
permitting a 5% margin on costs, have usually been negotiated against an overall
program funding limitation by Congress, which has resulted in carriers accepting
a subsidy rate that historically was not fully compensatory. With the enactment
of the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act and associated
increased funding, Congress appropriated a total of $113 million to compensate
EAS carriers for their total increased costs, including costs resulting from
September 11. This compares to an EAS subsidy level of $50 million for the
federal fiscal year ended September 30, 2001. The Company received approximately
$30.6 million of EAS subsidies in 2002 to compensate it for service it provides
to small cities as compared to $19.3 million in 2001. The total amount of
subsidy ultimately received over an extended period is determined by, among
other things, overall funding levels to the DOT by Congress, competitive bids by
other carriers, schedule modifications at the request of the DOT and the
Company's optimization of its schedules.

Relationship with United: Great Lakes may be impacted in the future by the
outcome of United's reorganization or liquidation in bankruptcy. Successful
reorganization by United may include changes in code sharing relationships under
a new business plan and changes in scope clauses contained in United's contract
with its pilots. As is the case with many of the major carriers, in the past,
United has agreed with its pilots to specific limits on the number of turboprop
and regional jet aircraft that may be operated by its affiliates, either as a
United Express or a code-sharing partner, in relation to the number of jet
aircraft that are flown by United pilots. The Company cannot predict what
limitations, if any, may be included in a United agreement with its pilots
negotiated as part of its reorganization. A liquidation would have a significant
impact on the Company's connecting traffic at Denver until Frontier increases
its service or a replacement carrier increases its operations and the Company is
able to enter into a marketing agreement with that carrier. There could also be
an increase in demand for the Company's services as service to smaller cities
currently receiving uneconomical jet service is discontinued.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the
reported


                                       25

<PAGE>

amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements,
revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company's most
critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the
portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and that require the
company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on
this definition, the Company has identified its critical accounting policies as
including those addressed below. The Company also has other key accounting
policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions. See
Note 3 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures" in the Notes
to the Financial Statements for additional discussion of these items. Management
believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, based on information
presently available; however, changes in these estimates, judgments and
assumptions will occur as a result of future events. Accordingly, actual results
could differ from amounts estimated.

Passenger revenues. The Company recognizes revenues from ticket sales when the
service is provided and records as a liability amounts received for service to
be provided in the future. To the extent that a passenger travels using a joint
fare that provides for a portion of the service to be provided by another
airline, the amount of the ticket is apportioned to the carrying airline based
upon contractual formulas which approximate usual industry standard formulas for
sharing of ticket revenues.

Essential Air Service Subsidy Rates. EAS revenues are recorded based on
completed contracts for providing service to individual cities and estimated
revenues based upon contract negotiations that are in process and could change
once the agreements are finalized.

Estimated lives used to record depreciation on aircraft and obsolescence
reserves for aircraft parts inventories. The estimated lives used to record
depreciation may be affected by passenger traffic and fare levels, technology,
policies regarding EAS subsidies promulgated by the DOT and changes in strategy
by the Company. The foregoing may impact depreciation rates, impairment, or
both.

Maintenance expense. The Company records maintenance expense as it is incurred
and does not provide for any maintenance expense in advance. As required under
the Restructuring Agreement and its agreement with Boeing, the Company will in
the future begin advance funding for certain maintenance overhauls, which will
be expensed as the overhaul is incurred.

Aircraft Valuation and Impairments. The Company has evaluated its long-lived
assets for possible impairments in compliance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company records impairment
losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances
indicate the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. Impairment
losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying
amounts. In determining the need to record impairment charges, the Company is
required to make certain estimates regarding such things as the current fair
market value of the asset and future net cash flows to be generated by the
asset. The current fair market value of the asset is determined by independent
appraisal, and the future net cash flow are based on assumptions such as asset
utilization, expected remaining useful lives, future market trends and projected
salvage values. In conjunction with the Restructuring Agreement, the Company
incurred an impairment charge of $5,469,539 to reduce the carrying value of the
six 1900D aircraft to fair market value as of December 31, 2002.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addressed financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. While Statement
No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, it retains


                                       26

<PAGE>

many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also
supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30,
Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of A
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business. The
Company adopted SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002. The adoption did not have a
material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as
of April 2002." This statement rescinds SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses
from Extinguishment of Debt," and an amendment of that Statement, SFAS No. 64,
"Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements" and excludes
extraordinary item treatment for gains and losses associated with the
extinguishment of debt that do not meet the APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the
Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions" ("APB 30") criteria. Any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt
that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that
does not meet the criteria in APB 30 for classification as an extraordinary item
shall be reclassified. SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for
Leases," as well as other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under
changed conditions. SFAS 145 is applied to all transactions occurring after May
15, 2002 and for all financial statements issued after that date. The adoption
did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results
of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities." This statement addresses financial accounting
and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and
nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94-3"). SFAS No.
146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94-3, a
liability for exit costs, as defined in EITF 94-3, was recognized at the date of
an entity's commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by the Company
after December 31, 2002. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company's financial condition or results of operations unless the Company
enters into an exit or disposal activity covered by this statement.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure." This statement amends FASB Statement
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement
amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. SFAS 148 is effective for financial statements for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of
operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others," which disclosures are effective for financial
statements issued after December 15, 2002. This Interpretation elaborates on the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The Company does not believe that the adoption will have
a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

Effects of Inflation

Except for the price of fuel, inflation has not had a material effect on the
Company's operations in the past five years. The Company is subject to
inflationary pressures from labor agreements, fuel price escalations and costs
at airports served which it attempts to recover through fare and schedule
adjustments.

Seasonality

Historically, the Company has experienced lower passenger volumes during the
months of January through April and in November and December. This seasonality
can be attributed primarily to relatively difficult winter weather operating
conditions in the Company's principal area of operations, resulting in fewer
vacations and other discretionary trips and reduced business travel during these
months. These seasonal factors have generally resulted in reduced revenues,
increased operating losses and reduced cash flow for the Company during these
months.

Item7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risks

The Company is susceptible to certain risks related to changes in the cost of
aircraft fuel and changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2002, the
Company did not have any derivative financial instruments.

Aircraft Fuel

Airline operators are dependent upon fuel to operate and therefore, are impacted
by changes in aircraft fuel prices. Great Lakes' earnings are affected by
changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Aircraft fuel
represented approximately 13.2% of Great Lakes' operating expenses in 2002. A
one-cent change in the average cost of aircraft fuel would impact the Company's
aircraft fuel expense by approximately $115,000 annually, based upon fuel
consumption in 2002.

Interest Rates

The Company's operations are very capital intensive because the vast majority of
its assets consists of flight equipment, which is long lived. The Company's
exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to its
debt obligations. The Company has exposure to changes in cash flows resulting
from changes in interest rates because a significant portion of its long-term
debt has variable interest rates. Additionally, the Company is exposed to
changes in fair values of its debt obligations that carry fixed rates of
interest. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A one percent
increase in interest rates would increase annual interest cost by approximately
$800,000 annually based on December 31, 2002 balances.

Due to the accounting treatment of the restructuring of the Raytheon liabilities
under SFAS 15, the Company's interest expense under SFAS 15 will be
significantly less than the contractual interest expense throughout the terms of
the Raytheon notes. At December 31, 2002, the interest expense, for purposes of
accounting under SFAS 15, on long-term obligations due in the five subsequent
years and thereafter are as follows:

                          Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors
Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd.
(an Iowa Corporation) as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002. In
connection with our audits of the financial statements we have also audited the
financial statement schedule. These financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd. as
of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 1 to the
financial statements, the Company has suffered significant losses in the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and has liabilities in excess of assets at
December 31, 2002. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these
matters are also described in note 1. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


(1)  Business, Liquidity, and Going-Concern Matters

     (a)  Business

          Great Lakes is a regional airline that until May 1, 2001 operated
          under the United Airlines, Inc. (United) identity as a United Express
          carrier. Effective May 1, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement
          with United which terminated the United Express relationship and
          established a code sharing relationship. Under this agreement the
          Company regained its own identity but continued sale and operation of
          connecting flight using the United flight codes. The Company also
          negotiated a similar code sharing agreement with Frontier Airlines,
          Inc. (Frontier) that became effective July 9, 2001. In addition to the
          above code sharing agreements, the Company operates flights to
          destinations under the Great Lakes Airlines name. Additionally, the
          Company operates charter and cargo flights, including cargo service
          for the US mail.

          As of March 1, 2003, the Company served 32 destinations in 9 states to
          and from Denver as code sharing partners with both United and
          Frontier. It also served 4 destinations in 2 states to and from
          Minneapolis and 2 destinations in 2 states to and from Phoenix. On
          February 28, 2003, the Company discontinued its service to its Chicago
          hub.

          Under the new code sharing relationship, approximately 71 % and 72 %
          of Great Lakes' traffic connected with United in 2002 and 2001,
          respectively. For the year 2000 when Great Lakes' operations were
          totally conducted as a United Express carrier, 75 % of the Great
          Lakes' passengers connected with United.

     (b)  Liquidity and Going-Concern Matters

          The Company suffered substantial losses during the fourth quarter of
          2000 and the years 2001 and 2002. These losses produced a significant
          reduction in liquidity, and the Company made only minor payments on
          the majority of its debt and lease obligations during 2001 and 2002.
          As a result, during 2001 and 2002 the Company was not in compliance
          with payment terms and financial covenants covering certain debt
          obligations and was in arrears on lease payment obligations. On
          December 31, 2002, the Company entered into a restructuring
          transaction with its primary lender and aircraft financer as discussed
          in Note 2.

          In addition, in December 2002, United filed for bankruptcy protection
          under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. There can be no assurance
          that United will be able to emerge from bankruptcy protection or will
          continue to utilize the services of the Company as a regional airline
          connection at levels that will allow the Company to become profitable.
          The Company's dependence on United, combined with the liquidity
          matters discussed above, raise doubts about the Company's ability to
          continue as a going concern.

          The Company's ability to continue as a going concern, of which there
          is substantial doubt, depends upon its ability to increase
          profitability and cash flow and/or obtain new sources of financing to
          pay its obligations as they come due, upon maintaining adequate
          liquidity, and achieving sustained profitability. The accompanying
          financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which
          assumes continuity of operations and realization of assets and
          liabilities in the ordinary course

                                                                     (Continued)

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


          of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
          that might result if the Company was forced to discontinue its
          operations.

          The Company currently has no financing agreements in place under which
          it can secure additional funds. The Company has reached agreements
          with the creditors providing debt financing for its equipment and,
          with the exception of a lease of one Embraer Brasilia EMB 120, its
          equipment lessors to restructure the agreements to improve
          profitability and cash flow.

          In certain instances the Company has required subsequent amendments
          and short-term waivers of payments and other provisions of the
          agreements with certain creditors. As a result of these waivers and
          amendments, at December 31, 2002, the Company is in compliance with
          all of its long-term debt and lease obligations. However, the Company
          cannot determine with a high degree of probability that it will be
          able to make the required payments or remain in compliance with the
          agreements during the year 2003. Therefore the amount of debt that by
          its terms would otherwise be due after one year is shown as long-term
          obligations classified as current.

(2)  Restructuring Agreement with Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation

     On December 31, 2002, the Company finalized an agreement (the Restructuring
     Agreement) with Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation (Raytheon) regarding
     lease and debt financing provided by Raytheon for the Company's Beechcraft
     1900C and 1900D aircraft fleet. The complex nature of the Restructuring
     Agreement included separate provisions for i) the termination and/or
     modification of aircraft operating leases, ii) the return of aircraft in
     satisfaction of indebtedness obligations, iii) the modification of
     principal and interest rates for various aircraft financing promissory
     notes, and iv) a restructuring of other indebtedness by means of an
     issuance of new debt instruments and equity. For purposes of accounting for
     the Restructuring Agreement, the Company has identified the major types of
     transactions contained within the Restructuring Agreement in order to more
     accurately apply the appropriate accounting treatment to each type of
     transaction. Transactions involving the termination and/or modification of
     aircraft operating leases have been accounted for pursuant to the
     provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13,
     Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), while the restructuring of indebtedness
     owed by the Company to Raytheon has been accounted for in accordance with
     the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15,
     Accounting for Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings (SFAS
     15). Accordingly, the major elements of the Restructuring Agreement and the
     Company's accounting treatment of those transactions are as follows:

     (a)  Return of Aircraft

          The Company has agreed to return seven Beechcraft 1900D aircraft to
          Raytheon during 2003 in exchange for the cancellation and
          extinguishment of one operating lease and six promissory notes.
          Because the Company will incur repair and refurbishment expenses
          during 2003 in order to return the aircraft to Raytheon in good
          working order, the Company has recognized a liability of $4 million
          for such expenditures. In addition, and in accordance with the
          provisions of SFAS 15 regarding the satisfaction of debt by a transfer
          of assets, the Company has adjusted the net book value of the six
          owned aircraft down to the aircrafts' fair market value of $15
          million, and has recognized an impairment loss of $5.5 million. Upon
          return of the aircraft to Raytheon in 2003, the Company expects to
          reduce its outstanding aircraft debt and lease liabilities for these
          seven aircraft by $20.9 million and record a gain from extinguishment
          of debt of $5.4 million.

     (b)  Termination of Aircraft Operating Leases/Financed Purchase of Aircraft

          Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, operating leases
          for nine Beechcraft 1900D aircraft (the "Purchased Aircraft") have
          been converted to aircraft ownership with purchase money

                                                                     (Continued)

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


          financing. The Company has recorded the purchase of the nine aircraft
          at a total fair market value of $22.5 million with a corresponding
          increase in long-term aircraft debt. Interest will accrue on the
          unpaid principal balance of the new debt at the rate of LIBOR plus 375
          basis points per annum. Payments of principal and accrued interest are
          to be made in 120 monthly installments, with the amount of the monthly
          payment to be adjusted quarterly to reflect any change in the LIBOR
          rate.

     (c)  Restructured Financing Terms for Aircraft Promissory Notes

          The Company obtained amended debt financing for 21 Beechcraft 1900D
          aircraft promissory notes (the "Restructured Aircraft Notes") in the
          amount of $52.5 million. Each of the Restructured Aircraft Notes
          reflects an initial principal balance in the amount of $2.5 million
          with interest to accrue on the unpaid principal balance at the rate of
          LIBOR plus 375 basis points per annum. Payments of principal and
          accrued interest are to be made in 120 monthly installments, with the
          amount of monthly payment to be adjusted quarterly to reflect any
          change in the LIBOR rate. Total cash payments for all of the
          Restructured Aircraft Notes is estimated to be $68.1 million over the
          term of the notes.

     (d)  Accounting for Refinancing of Aircraft Debt and Lease Obligations
          under SFAS 15

          Consistent with SFAS 15, the restructured financing terms for all 30
          of the Beechcraft 1900D aircraft debt and lease obligations discussed
          in (b) and (c) above (the "Old Aircraft Debt") has been accounted for
          as a troubled debt restructuring. SFAS 15 states that in a troubled
          debt restructuring, the debtor shall account for the effects of the
          restructuring prospectively from the time of restructuring and shall
          not reduce the carrying amount of the existing debt unless the
          carrying amount of the existing debt exceeds the total future cash
          payments of the new debt under the restructured terms. Included in the
          carrying value of restructured debt and lease obligations were $3.7
          million of deferred gains and other deferred credits. The effects of
          any changes in the face amount or interest rate are to be amortized in
          future periods by reducing interest expense to an effective interest
          rate which equates the net present value of the future cash payments
          under the modified terms to the carrying value on the debtor's books.

          After increasing the Company's liabilities by $22.5 million for
          financing of the Purchased Aircraft, the carrying value on the
          Company's books for the Old Aircraft Debt was $101.3 million, while
          total future cash flows for the thirty (30) new and amended aircraft
          promissory notes (the "New Aircraft Debt") was estimated to be $95.7
          million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 15, the amount of
          the Company's long-term liabilities has been reduced by $5.6 million
          in order to reflect the carrying value of the Old Aircraft Debt to an
          amount not more than the estimated future cash flows of the New
          Aircraft Debt. The $20.7 million difference between the $95.7 million
          restructured value of the Old Aircraft Debt and the $75 million
          principal amount of the New Aircraft Debt will be amortized as a
          reduction to the Company's interest expense over the next ten years.

     (e)  Modification of Terms for Aircraft Operating Leases

          Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, $384,000 of
          pre-12/31/02 unpaid lease payments on two Beechcraft 1900C aircraft
          operating leases has been contractually extinguished and the Company
          negotiated a reduction in the monthly lease payments for the two
          leases, which is

                                                                     (Continued)

                           GREAT LAKES AVIATION, LTD.

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


          anticipated to yield net cash flow savings of $1.2 million over the
          next ten years. The $384,000 liability will remain on the Company's
          books and be amortized over a period of 120 months.

     (f)  Other Debt Restructuring Involving Partial Settlement Through Issuance
          of Equity

          $14.9 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest on various
          non-aircraft debt was restructured into three new promissory notes
          (the "Non-Aircraft Debt") with a total principal amount of $11.2
          million and estimated future cash payments of $15.2 million. In
          addition, the Company issued 5,371,980 shares of the Company's common
          stock to Raytheon, representing a 38.2% interest in the Company's
          outstanding post-restructuring shares of common stock.

          The restructuring of the Non-Aircraft Debt through the issuance of
          equity and new debt obligation(s) was accounted for in compliance with
          SFAS 15. The new debt obligations were recorded at the carrying amount
          of the prior debt obligation(s), less the fair value of the equity
          granted to Raytheon. The Company has determined that, on the effective
          date of the Restructuring Agreement, the fair market value of the
          equity interest granted to Raytheon was $2.1 million. Accordingly, the
          Company has reduced $14.9 million of Non-Aircraft Debt by $2.1 million
          to a net carrying amount of $12.8 million, and has recorded an
          increase of $2.1 million in shareholders' equity.

     (g)  Board of Director Observer Rights

          As further consideration for the concessions granted by Raytheon in
          the Restructuring Agreement, the Company has granted Raytheon
          unlimited observer rights for the Company's Board of Directors, but
          without any right to vote or enter into any discussions at any Board
          of Directors meetings.

     (h)  Subsequent Events

          The Company did not make its February and March 2003 payments under
          the Restructuring Agreement to Raytheon and will not make the payments
          due Raytheon in April 2003. In addition, the Company is not in
          compliance with certain financial covenants contained in that
          Agreement. On April 14, 2003 Raytheon waived the foregoing
          requirements until June 15, 2003.

          At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with its debt
          agreements or had obtained amendments or short-term waivers from its
          lenders with respect to any nonpayment of scheduled debt installments
          or noncompliance with financial covenants. However, the Company cannot
          determine with a high degree of confidence that it will be able to
          make the required payments or remain in compliance with the agreements
          during the year 2003. Therefore the amount of debt that by its terms
          would otherwise be due after one year is shown as long-term
          obligations classified as current. In addition to the contractual
          amounts due the lenders, the balance includes $22.3 million of
          additional carrying amounts under FAS 15.

     A summary of the obligations immediately preceding the restructuring, the
     contractual obligations after the restructuring and the recording of the
     restructuring in accordance with SFAS 13 and 15 is set forth below.

                                                                     (Continued)

(3)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures

     (a)  Use of Estimates

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
          principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
          to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported

                                                                     (Continued)

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


          amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
          and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
          reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
          Significant estimates include ticket revenue, government air service
          subsidies, depreciable lives, impairment and obsolescence and lease
          termination costs. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     (b)  Accounts Receivable

          Substantially all accounts receivable balances are due from various
          airlines and the U.S. government, with approximately 5% and 42% of the
          December 31, 2002 and 42% and 45% of the December 31, 2001, balances,
          respectively due from United and the U.S. government. All receivables
          are pledged as collateral securing the Company's debt agreements.

     (c)  Inventories

          Inventories consist of spare parts, fuel, materials, and supplies
          relating to flight equipment and are stated at the lower of average
          cost or market. Allowances for obsolescence are provided over the
          estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines for spare
          parts expected to be on hand at the date aircraft are retired from
          service. Expendable parts are charged to maintenance expense as used.
          Inventories consisting of spare parts and equipment are pledged as
          collateral securing the Raytheon notes.

     (d)  Property and Equipment

          Property and equipment includes aircraft and major parts relating to
          such aircraft and is stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line
          basis for financial reporting purposes over estimated useful lives of
          14-20 years for flight equipment and 3-10 years for other property and
          equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
          the life of the lease or the life of the asset. Accelerated methods of
          depreciation are used for tax reporting purposes. All owned aircraft
          are pledged to collateralize outstanding obligations.

          Maintenance and repairs, including periodic aircraft overhauls, are
          expensed as incurred or when the component is placed in service.

     (e)  Measurement of Impairment

          The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
          (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
          Long-Lived Assets which supercedes SFAS No. 121. The Company reviews
          long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
          circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
          recoverable. When factors indicate that the carrying amount of an
          asset may not be recoverable, the Company estimates the impairment
          from the use of such asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of
          any impairment is included in income from continuing operations and
          the method or methods of determining fair value are disclosed.

                                                                     (Continued)

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


     (f)  Other Assets

          Other assets are deposits with financial institutions, bonding
          companies, facilities lessors and others to secure the payment of
          fixed obligations. $1.1 million and $2.1 million at December 31, 2002
          and 2001, respectively, represents deposits related to long term
          operating leases. As a result of restructuring described in Note 2,
          certain deposits were cancelled.

     (g)  Long-term Obligations Classified As Current

          At December 31, 2001, the Company was not in compliance with its debt
          agreements as a result of nonpayment of scheduled installments of
          substantially all of its long-term debt at that time. In accordance
          with generally accepted accounting principles, long-term debt which
          may become due and payable at the option of the lender as a result of
          noncompliance under the debt agreement was classified as a current
          liability.

          At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with its debt
          agreements or had obtained amendments or short-term waivers from its
          lenders with respect to any nonpayment of scheduled debt installments
          or noncompliance with financial covenants. However, the Company cannot
          determine with a high degree of confidence that it will be able to
          make the required payments or remain in compliance with the agreements
          during the year 2003. Therefore the amount of debt that by its terms
          would otherwise be due after one year is shown as long-term
          obligations classified as current. In addition to the contractual
          amounts due the lenders, the balance includes $22.3 million of
          additional carrying amounts under FAS 15.

     (h)  Accrued Liabilities

          The balance in accrued liabilities consists of the following at
          December 31, 2002 and 2001:

                                                      2002         2001
                                                  -----------   ----------
                Accrued expenses                  $   689,796   $  286,500
                Unearned revenue                    1,942,634      368,142
                Accrued property taxes                356,246      682,734
                Accrued payroll                     1,497,860    1,510,595
                Accrued aircraft refurbishment      4,000,000           --
                Accrued interest                    1,488,106    4,260,672
                                                  -----------   ----------
                                                  $ 9,974,642   $7,108,643
                                                  ===========   ==========

     (i)  Deferred Payments

          During 1997, the Company failed to make scheduled payments on several
          leases and subsequently renegotiated substantially all of their lease
          agreements. The renegotiated leases contain higher monthly payments
          and longer payment terms than the original agreements. The unpaid
          rentals have been accrued and expensed in the period to which they
          related and are being amortized over the new lease terms of the
          aircraft as a reduction in future operating costs. During 2002, as a
          result of the

                                                                     (Continued)

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


          Company's restructuring transaction, the unamortized deferred payments
          are included in the amounts reflected in Note 2.

     (j)  Deferred Credits

          The Company has received various incentives in the form of interest
          rate subsidies and spares parts in connection with the acquisition of
          new aircraft. Incentives are being amortized as a reduction of rent
          expense or interest expense over the term of the related agreement.
          During 2002, as a result of the Company's restructuring transaction,
          certain of the unamortized deferred credits were included in the
          amounts reflected in Note 2.

     (k)  Revenue Recognition

          Passenger revenues are recorded as income when the respective services
          are rendered or when the time for use of the ticket has expired.
          Liability for unused tickets issued by the Company is recorded as
          unearned revenue. The Company also receives public service subsidy
          revenues for serving certain communities that do not generate
          sufficient traffic to fully support profitable air service, which are
          recorded as revenue based on rates applicable to such periods as
          approved by the Department of Transportation as the agreed upon air
          service is furnished by the Company.

     (l)  Frequent Flyer Awards

          The Company operates under a code-sharing agreement with United. It
          also participates in United's frequent flyer program for which an
          agreement is being negotiated. The Company has not deferred any
          revenue or accrued for incremental costs or revenue for mileage
          accumulation relating to these programs, and believes the impact has
          not been material.

     (m)  Income Taxes

          Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
          Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
          consequences attributable to differences between the financial
          statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
          their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry
          forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
          enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
          which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
          settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets
          and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes
          the enactment date.

     (n)  Loss Per Share

          Basic loss per share has been computed by dividing net loss by the
          weighted average number of shares of common stock during outstanding
          each of the years presented. Diluted loss per share have been
          calculated by also including in the computation the impact of the
          issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding
          warrants and the effect of those employee stock options granted to
          employees as potential common stock that would be dilutive. Since the
          Company had suffered a net loss in the years ended December 31, 2002,
          2001 and 2000, the effects of potential common stock issuances were
          not included in the calculation for those years, as their effects
          would be anti-dilutive.

                                                                     (Continued)

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


     (o)  Stock Option Plans

          The Company has elected the pro forma disclosure option of Statement
          of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for
          Stock-Based Compensation. The Company will continue applying the
          accounting treatment prescribed by the provisions of APB Opinion No.
          25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Related
          Interpretations. Pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share
          have been provided as if SFAS No. 123 were adopted for all stock-based
          compensation plans.

          The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in
          accounting for the Plans, both of which are fixed stock option plans.
          Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Plans as
          exercise prices are at least equal to the fair market value of the
          Company's common stock on the date of Great Lakes. Had compensation
          cost for the Company's fixed stock option plans been determined
          consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net loss and loss per
          share would have been impacted as follows:

          As required, the pro forma disclosures above include options granted
          since January 1, 1995. Consequently, the effects of applying SFAS 123
          for providing pro forma disclosures may not be representative of the
          effects on reported net income for future years until all options
          outstanding are included in the pro forma disclosures. For purposes of
          pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of stock-based
          compensation plans and other options is amortized to expense primarily
          over the vesting period. See Note 7 for further discussion of the
          assumptions relating to the Company's stock-based employee
          compensation.

     (p)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

          Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth below:

          Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities:

               The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the
               short-term nature of these instruments.

                                                                     (Continued)

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


          Long-term debt:

               Based upon the Company's concentration of long-term debt with the
               manufacturer of aircraft, the fair value of long-term debt was
               not reasonably determinable.

     (q)  Supplemental Disclosure of Noncash Investing and Financing Activities

          Amounts on the statement of cash flows exclude the one-time effect of
          recording the insured loss of one owned and one leased Beech 1900D and
          inventory in a hangar fire on May 14, 2002. The net book values of the
          Company's inventory and flight equipment lost were $794,000 and
          $3,821,000 respectively, and the Company had a debt obligation for the
          aircraft of $3,184,000. In addition, the Company incurred a liability
          to Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation for the stipulated loss value
          of the leased aircraft. Insurance proceeds on the assets totaled
          $9,988,000 of which $7,800,000 was paid to Raytheon on the foregoing
          obligations including past due interest and deferred lease payments on
          these aircraft. A gain on insurance recovery of $1,438,000 was
          recognized representing the excess of the total insurance over the net
          book value of the Company's assets that were destroyed and liability
          incurred on the leased aircraft.

(4)  Flight Equipment

          At December 31, 2002, the Company's passenger airline fleet consisted
          of 37 Beechcraft Model 1900D 19-passenger aircraft, seven Embraer
          Brasilia Model 120 30-passenger aircraft, and two Beechcraft Model
          1900C aircraft in a cargo configuration for carriage of U.S. mail. The
          Beechcraft 1900C aircraft are operated under leases with remaining
          terms of approximately 10 years and which include early termination
          provisions. One Beechcraft 1900D and three Embraer Brasilia Model 120
          aircraft are operated under long-term leases. The remaining aircraft
          are owned by the Company. After the restructuring transaction
          discussed above, a summary of the operating aircraft is as follows:

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


     At December 31, 2001, the Company's airline fleet consisted of 40
     Beechcraft Model 1900D 19-passenger aircraft, eight Embraer Brasilia Model
     120 30-passenger aircraft, and four Beechcraft Model 1900C aircraft in a
     cargo configuration for carriage of US mail. A summary as of December 31,
     2001 is as follows:

                                               2001

                             ==========    ==========        ========

     As of December 31, 2002, the Company had obtained executed waivers or
     deferrals from the following lessors with respect to the following unpaid
     lease rentals: Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation, $1,241,000 for the two
     Beechcraft 1900C and one Beechcraft 1900D aircraft leases; and Finova
     Capital Corporation, $897,000 for one Embraer 120 aircraft lease.

     At December 31, 2002, the Company was in arrears on rental payments to
     Boeing Capital Corporation ("Boeing") for lease of two Brasilia aircraft in
     the amount of $3.4 million. Subsequent to year-end, the Company entered
     into a letter agreement with Boeing, effective as of December 31, 2002, to
     cancel the unpaid lease installments, to reduce the monthly rental payments
     through the end of the lease terms in 2013, requiring the Company to fund
     major overhauls in advance and giving Boeing the right to terminate the
     leases at its option with six months notice. Boeing will receive shares of
     redeemable preferred stock valued at $4.5 million. The Company intends to
     file a Certificate of Designation setting forth the terms of the redeemable
     preferred stock by April 30, 2003. The parties will further document the
     terms and conditions of the lease restructuring by that date.

     Under the terms of four aircraft lease agreements, the Company is
     responsible for lease payments over the remaining term of the leases of
     approximately $7,474,000 to Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation and
     $404,000 to Finova Capital Corporation. However, such amounts would be
     mitigated by the proceeds from a subsequent lease or sale of the aircraft.
     The Company has agreed to return to Raytheon the one Beechcraft 1900D
     leased aircraft which is in excess of the Company's current requirements.
     Upon return of the aircraft in 2003, all of the Company's liability for
     unpaid lease rentals of $857,000 and future obligations of $4,040,000 under
     the lease agreement shall be extinguished. Provision has been made in the
     2002 financial statements for estimated repair and refurbishment costs of
     $571,400 that will be incurred in connection with the return of the
     Beechcraft 1900D aircraft.

     Under the current agreements, and following the restructuring discussed
     above, lease commitments for aircraft were as follows as of December 31,
     2002:

                                      Total
                                  ------------
        2003                      $  1,436,000

        2005                         1,128,000
        2006                         1,128,000
        2007                         1,200,000
        Thereafter                   6,862,000

                                  ============

     The lease commitments shown above exclude those commitments related to one
     aircraft to be returned to Raytheon as discussed in Note 2.

     Nonaircraft lease commitments are set forth in note 10.

     Raytheon Aircraft Corporation, including its financing affiliates, is the
     Company's primary aircraft supplier and largest creditor. The Company has
     financed all of its Beechcraft 1900 aircraft fleet pursuant to lease and
     debt agreements with Raytheon. In addition, pursuant to the Restructuring
     Agreement executed by Raytheon and the Company on December 31, 2002 (see
     Note 2), the Company has restructured other non-aircraft liabilities owed
     by the Company to Raytheon into three notes payable representing a total
     face amount of $11.2 million. Raytheon has also agreed to extend to the
     Company a $3 million line of credit for the purpose of financing a portion
     of the refurbishment costs to be incurred by the Company on the seven
     Beechcraft 1900D aircraft to be returned to Raytheon in 2003.

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


     (A)  On January 7, 2000, the Company entered into a $20 million line of
          credit agreement with Coast Business Credit. Under the terms of the
          agreement, interest accrued on the outstanding balance of the line of
          credit at a rate of prime plus 0.5% and at December 31, 2001 the
          interest rate was 8.5%. In April 2002, the Company paid in full all
          outstanding amounts due under the line of credit, and the line of
          credit was terminated.

     (B)  Unpaid principal payments which were due on Raytheon debt during 2001.

          On June 29, 2001, the Company issued a demand note to Raytheon in
          payment of substantially all of the principal, interest and lease
          installments on aircraft due Raytheon during the first 6 months of
          2001. According to the terms of the note, interest accrued on the
          principal balance at a rate of 8% (11% if the note was in default),
          with such interest to be paid monthly in arrears beginning August 1,
          2001. Amounts due under this note were restructured as discussed in
          Note 2, and the demand note was extinguished.

     (C)  At December 31, 2001, the Raytheon notes consisted of 31 term notes.
          The notes required monthly payments ranging from $30,000 to $145,000,
          including interest, with total payments on these notes approximating
          $1,150,000 per month. The interest rates on the notes ranged from 4.1%
          to 8.0% as of December 31, 2001.

          At December 31, 2002, the Raytheon notes consisted of 36 promissory
          notes and three long-term notes payable. Thirty of the promissory
          notes require monthly payments in the amount of $25,500, with interest
          accruing on unpaid balances at the rate of LIBOR plus 375 basis points
          per annum. A balloon payment of approximately $200,000 will be due and
          payable upon each promissory note's maturity at December 31, 2012.

          The other six promissory notes require monthly payments ranging from
          $30,000 to $35,000 with interest rates ranging from 4.75% to 7.15% per
          annum. The Company has agreed to return to Raytheon all six of the
          Beechcraft 1900D aircraft which serve as collateral for the six
          promissory notes, which aircraft are in excess of the Company's
          current requirements. As a result of this agreement, further payments
          of principal and interest under the six promissory notes will be
          deferred until the collateral aircraft are returned to Raytheon in
          2003, at which time all of the Company's liability under the six
          promissory notes will be extinguished. Provision has been made in the
          2002 financial statements for estimated repair and refurbishment costs
          of $3.4 million which will be incurred in connection with the return
          of the six Beechcraft 1900D aircraft.

          Of the three long-term notes payable, the first note payable requires
          quarterly payments of principal and interest during 2003 in amounts
          ranging from $16,500 per quarter to $150,000 per quarter, with
          interest accruing on the unpaid balances at the rate of LIBOR plus 375
          basis points per annum. The first note payable will mature on December
          31, 2005. The second note payable requires no payments until 2005, at
          which time payments of principal and interest in the amount of
          $362,000 will be due and payable quarterly. Interest will accrue on
          the unpaid balances at the rate of 8.25% per annum and the second note
          payable will mature on December 31, 2009. The third note payable
          requires no payments until 2005, at which time payments of interest
          ranging in amounts from $41,000 to $44,000 will be due and payable
          quarterly. Interest will accrue on the unpaid balances at

                                                                     (Continued)

                         Notes to Financial Statements

                       December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000


          the rate of 6% per annum. The third note payable will mature on
          September 30, 2007, at which time all outstanding amounts under the
          note will be due and payable.

          All of the Raytheon notes are collateralized by the Beechcraft 1900
          aircraft and other assets of the Company.

     (D)  Other long-term notes consist primarily of four term notes that
          require monthly or quarterly payments, including interest, and are
          collateralized by Embraer aircraft. At December 31, 2002, the interest
          rates on the notes ranged from 8.7% to 10%.

     (E)  At December 31, 2001, the Company was not in compliance with payment
          terms of the Raytheon debt. As a result, in accordance with generally
          accepted accounting principles, all of the long-term debt owed by the
          Company to Raytheon was classified as a current liability because of
          Raytheon's ability under the debt agreements to require payment of the
          total outstanding obligations.

          At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with its debt
          agreements or had obtained waivers or deferrals from its lenders with
          respect to any nonpayment of scheduled debt installments. As a result,
          and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, $12.4
          million of principal payments due and payable during 2003 have been
          classified by the Company as a current liability, of which $7.0
          million represents the contractual amount of principal payments due
          and payable during 2003 to Raytheon and $3.4 million represents the
          current portion of additional carrying amounts under SFAS 15 (see note
          2).

          Notwithstanding the Company's current compliance with its debt
          agreements or availability of waivers, however, the Company cannot
          determine with a high degree of confidence that it will be able to
          make future required payments or remain in compliance with the
          agreements during the year 2003. Therefore, the amount of debt that
          by its terms would otherwise be due after one year is shown as long-
          term obligations classified as current.

     As of December 31, 2002, the long-term debt obligations due in the five
     subsequent years and thereafter under their contractual terms were as
     follows:

          accounted for its Employee stock-based compensation plans and other
          stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair value
          of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the

     Stabilization Act), which provides, among other things, for $5 billion in
     grants to compensate U.S. air carriers for losses incurred by the air
     carriers as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

                                                                     (Continued)

(10) Commitments and Contingencies

     (a)  Transactions with Affiliates

          In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company leased one Beechcraft 1900D used
          in airline operations from a company owned by Great Lakes' chairman
          and majority stockholder. Total payments under these leases that the
          Company had with entities that are owned by the Company's chairman
          were $10,000 in 2002, $287,000 in 2001, and $587,000 in 2000. The
          Company returned the aircraft in April 2002. The Company also accrued
          lease payments for charter aircraft and automobiles owned by this
          company in 2002 in the amount of $51,075 for which no payments have
          been made.

                                                                     (Continued)

     (b)  Nonaircraft Lease Commitments

          The Company leases certain hanger and terminal facilities under
          operating leases, which provide for approximate future noncancelable
          minimum lease payments, as follows:

                      2003                        $  254,405

                                                  ==========

     (c)  Litigation

          On February 27, 2002, Finova Capital Corporation ("Finova") filed suit
          against the Company in the United States District Court for the
          District of Arizona. No. Civ. 02-0362 PHX SMM. Finova alleged that the
          Company breached two airplane lease agreements and sought damages,
          costs and attorney's fees. On August 1, 2002, Finova and the Company
          entered into a Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not to Execute on one
          of the aircraft. On November 1, 2002, Finova and the Company entered
          into a Deferral Agreement which provides for the withdrawal of the
          suit and payment of $10,000 per month from October 2002 through March
          2003 and $15,000 per month from April 2003 until the end of the lease
          term on September 30, 2003 for the second aircraft. Finova and the
          Company have agreed that prior to the end of the lease term they will
          negotiate the other outstanding issues regarding the second aircraft.
          The Company has recognized in its accounts the expected cost
          associated with these aircraft.

          The Company is a also a defendant in a lawsuit arising from the
          collision of a small aircraft with one of the Company's Beechcraft
          1900 aircraft in Quincy, Illinois on November 19, 1996. The collision
          occurred at the intersection of two runways as the Company's aircraft
          was landing, and resulted in the death of all 10 passengers and the
          two crewmembers. The Company's insurance carrier is providing for the
          Company's defense in the lawsuit and the Company believes that all
          claims arising from the accident will be adequately covered by
          insurance.

          The Company is a party to other ongoing legal claims and assertions
          arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that
          the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
          effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or
          cash flows.

     (d)  Union Agreements

          The Company's pilots are represented by the International Brotherhood
          of Teamsters. The Agreement with the pilots became amendable October
          30, 2000, and negotiations are continuing. In March 2002, the
          Company's pilots voted to authorize a strike in the event that
          negotiations did not result in an amended contract. The Company's
          flight attendants are also represented by the International
          Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the agreement with the flight attendants
          became amendable April 2002.

                                                                     (Continued)

in the event of a termination of the executive's employment by the Company,
other than for "cause," or by the executive for "good reason" the executive will
continue to be paid their salary for the remainder of the contract. As part of
these agreements, Messrs. Voss and Howell each received stock options to
purchase 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of
$0.40 per share. The options vest ratably on the first and second anniversary
date of the employment agreements.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

     Messrs. Mickelson and Simpson comprised the Compensation Committee for
purposes of setting compensation levels for 2002. No member of the Compensation
Committee was an officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiary during the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2002. Mr. Simpson was an officer and employee of
the Company from 1979 through 1987. No executive officer of the Company served
as a member of the compensation committee or the board of directors of another
entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation
Committee or Board during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002.

Compensation of Directors

     Directors of the Company who are not employees of the Company participate
in the Company's 1993 Director Stock Option Plan, receive $1,000 for each
meeting of the Board or a meeting of a committee of the Board attended (not to
exceed $1,000 per day) and are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred on

Item 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation owns 5,371,980 shares of common stock
of the Company, representing 38.2% of the shares of common stock outstanding as
of March 31, 2003. The Company issued the

<PAGE>

shares to Raytheon as partial consideration for a series of transactions that
included restructured finance terms for aircraft promissory notes, termination
of aircraft operating leases, aircraft purchases, aircraft returns, modified
aircraft operating leases and other debt restructuring. See "Business" for a
description of the Restructuring Agreement, including certain continuing rights
and obligations of the parties.

     Douglas G. Voss is the sole owner of Iowa Great Lakes Flyers, Inc.
("Flyers"), a corporation that owns and operates four-passenger and
six-passenger aircraft, a fleet of rental cars and until April 2002, one
Beechcraft 1900D aircraft that are leased to the Company. The Company believes
that its leases with Flyers are on terms no less favorable to the Company than
would be similar transactions with unaffiliated third parties. In conjunction
with these leases the Company made a payment of $10,000 during 2002 to Flyers.
Additionally, from time to time Flyers loans funds to the Company on a short
term basis. As of April 1, 2003, the Company had a net outstanding balance of
$251,487 due to Flyers.

                                    AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, Great Lakes and RACC agree as follows:

1.      Recitals Incorporated. The parties hereto hereby incorporate the
        Recitals as if fully set forth herein.

2.      Group A Aircraft. The following applies to all Group A Aircraft.

        (A)     Return Conditions. The Group A Aircraft, including engines,
                shall be returned by Great Lakes to RACC to destinations within
                the United States selected by RACC in accordance with the
                schedule attached hereto as Schedule 1. The Group A Aircraft are
                to be returned in accordance with the following terms and
                conditions (the "Return Conditions"): (i) all engines, engine
                life cycle fatigue components, propellers, airframe and other
                time/life components shall be at a minimum of half-life
                remaining, as defined in accordance with the aircraft
                manufacturer's maintenance manual or, in the case of engines, as
                set forth in Pratt & Whitney's engine overhaul recommendations.
                With regards to the half life requirement RACC may waive this
                requirement on a case by case basis in economic consideration of
                the component time remaining and for consideration that certain
                components may be returned with better than half life remaining.
                In all cases the decision of the RACC representative will be
                final. (ii) all originally installed equipment shall be in
                working order, (iii) such Group A Aircraft shall be airworthy,
                and immediately prior to return have a complete 1-6 detail
                inspection, and no structural inspections due within 5% of the
                structural inspection schedule. Any structural inspection that
                is due within 5% of the inspection schedule will be completed
                prior to the return of the aircraft. This 5% requirement may be
                waived on a case by case basis as agreed to by the GLA Director
                of Maintenance and the RACC representative. All required
                inspections shall be completed by an FAA Authorized Part 145
                Certified Repair Station. (CRS) The aircraft shall be in
                compliance with all Airworthiness Directives issued by the FAA
                pertaining to such Group

                Aircraft shall be delivered ready for Commuter use under part
                121 and/or Part 91. RACC shall promptly perform an inspection of
                each Group A Aircraft and attached engines, airframe and other
                time/life components that is returned to it so as to determine
                whether all of the Return Conditions have been satisfied. In the
                event that RACC determines that any Group A Aircraft is not in
                compliance with any of the Return Conditions, RACC shall
                promptly notify Great Lakes in writing of such determination and
                RACC shall have the option of either requesting that Great Lakes
                (1) remedy such noncompliance in a manner reasonably
                satisfactory to RACC within thirty (30) days or (2) return a
                substitute Group B Aircraft designated by RACC in compliance
                with the Return Conditions within thirty (30) days, in which
                case such substitute Group B Aircraft shall be deemed to be a
                Group A Aircraft for purposes of this Agreement and such
                noncompliant Group A Aircraft shall be deemed to be a Group B
                Aircraft for purposes of this Agreement. If RACC requests, Great
                Lakes shall store and maintain any Group A Aircraft accepted by
                RACC for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days.

                provided with respect to all of the Group A Aircraft shall not
                exceed $3,000,000. The Advances shall be evidenced by a
                promissory note executed by Great Lakes payable to RACC (the
                "Group A Return Conditions Note," the form of which is attached
                hereto as Exhibit A), which shall have a bullet maturity on the
                fourth anniversary of issue (December 31, 2006) and bear
                interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points. "LIBOR"
                shall mean the rate of interest determined by RACC at which

                the date of the issuance of the Group A Return Conditions Note
                or the first day of January, April, July and October, as
                applicable, provided, however, that if the rate described above
                does not appear in The Wall Street Journal on any applicable
                interest determination date, LIBOR shall be the rate determined
                by RACC in good faith based on the offered rates for deposits in
                Dollars for ninety (90) days that are then offered by major
                banks in the London interbank market. LIBOR shall be adjusted on
                the first business day of each calendar quarter to reflect any
                increase or decrease in LIBOR as of that date.

        shall be extinguished and cancelled by RACC as of the "Effective Date"
        (as hereinafter defined in Section 14). The outstanding principal amount
        of this indebtedness as of the Effective Date is approximately
        $13,750,000, and the amount of the past due interest obligation will be
        approximately $1,000,000, for a total approximate obligation of
        $14,750,000. Great Lakes acknowledges that $1,100,000 that it previously
        has paid to RACC as lease deposits for certain leased aircraft has been
        applied in connection with the restructuring pursuant to this Agreement
        and that Great Lakes no longer has any rights to such funds.

                outstanding post-restructuring shares of Common Stock on a
                fully-diluted, as if fully exercised, basis. Such shares of
                Common Stock shall be duly authorized, fully paid and

                equity incentive plan to be implemented in the near future
                provided that all recipients of options pursuant to such
                additional equity incentive plan sign lockup agreements as set
                forth in Section 14(B)(31), (iv) the issuance of up to 2,300,000
                shares of Common Stock in connection with the exercise of any of

                shares of Common Stock pursuant to Great Lakes' Employee Stock
                Purchase Plan, if, at any time or from time to time Great Lakes
                issues any shares of, or options or warrants to purchase or
                other securities convertible into, Common Stock (an "Additional
                Issuance"), Great Lakes shall provide not less than five (5)
                days' prior written notice of such Additional Issuance to RACC,
                and RACC shall be entitled to receive, on the date of each such
                issuance (an "Additional Issuance Date"), by giving Great Lakes
                notice within thirty (30) days of its receipt of Great Lakes'
                notice of such Additional Issuance, at a price per share equal
                to the price per share payable in connection with such
                Additional Issuance or, in the case of an option or warrant to
                purchase Common Stock, at a price per share equal to the price
                per option, if any, payable in connection with such Additional
                Issuance plus the per share exercise price thereunder, a number
                of additional shares of Common Stock (the "Anti-Dilution
                Shares") as is equal to the product of (i) fifty-six and 25/100
                (56.25) multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock
                issued or issuable in connection with such Additional Issuance,
                determined on a fully-diluted basis. The Anti-Dilution Shares,
                when issued, shall be duly authorized, fully paid and
                nonassessable shares of Common Stock. The certificates for the
                Anti-Dilution Shares shall be issued in

<PAGE>

                                      -9-

                the name of RACC (or RACC's transferee or designee), and
                delivered to such person within three (3) business days after
                the Additional Issuance Date. Issuance of certificates for
                Anti-Dilution Shares shall be made without charge to RACC (or
                RACC's transferee or designee) for any issue or transfer taxes
                or other incidental expenses in respect of the issuance of such
                certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by
                Great Lakes. This Section 8(B) shall expire upon the earlier of
                (1) the Debt Service Ratio (as defined in Section 15(A)) as at
                the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters being greater
                than or equal to 3.0:1.0 or (2) the Free Cash Flow (as defined
                on Schedule 5) as at the end of any fiscal year is greater than
                or equal to $15,000,000 (the date of such earlier occurrence is
                referred to as the "Limited Termination Date") provided that
                Great Lakes is in compliance with this Agreement, each of the
                other Transaction Documents (as defined below) and any other
                agreement between itself and RACC.

        (C)     Restrictions on Transfers to Competitors. Great Lakes shall have
                the right of first refusal with respect to any proposed sale by
                RACC of all or any portion of the RACC Shares or any
                Anti-Dilution Shares received by RACC (collectively, the
                "Shares") to any regional commuter airline that competes
                directly with Great Lakes and is listed on Schedule 3 hereto.
                Prior to accepting any bona fide offer for purchase of any
                Shares, RACC shall give to Great Lakes notice in writing (the
                "Offer Notice") disclosing the price and the terms at which RACC
                proposes to sell such Shares pursuant to such bona fide offer,
                and within twenty (20) days after such notice has been given
                Great Lakes shall give RACC notice (the "Reply Notice") of its
                intention to purchase or not to purchase at the price and on the
                terms specified in the Offer Notice accompanied by a bona fide
                third party lender's proposal for the financing of any such
                purchase (a "Financing Proposal"). Within thirty (30) days after
                providing the Reply Notice and Financing Proposal, Great Lakes
                shall provide RACC with evidence of such lender's firm
                commitment to provide the financing referenced in the Financing
                Proposal (the "Financing Commitment"). Upon receipt of a
                Financing Commitment, Great Lakes shall pay to RACC a good faith
                purchase deposit in an amount mutually acceptable to each of
                RACC and Great Lakes. If Great Lakes gives notice of its
                intention to purchase in the Reply Notice and provides RACC with
                the Financing Proposal and the Financing Commitment in
                accordance with the terms hereof, RACC will sell to Great Lakes
                or its nominee such Shares on the same terms and conditions set
                forth in the Offer Notice. If (i) Great Lakes notifies RACC in
                the Reply Notice of its intention not to purchase at such price
                and on such terms, (ii) or if no Reply Notice, Financing
                Proposal or Financing Commitment is given by Great Lakes in
                accordance with the

<PAGE>

                                      -10-

                terms hereof or (iii) if Great Lakes fails to close the purchase
                of such Shares within twenty (20) days after its delivery of a
                Financing Commitment, RACC shall be free to sell such Shares
                described in the Offer Notice, within 120 days after the Offer
                Notice has been given, to the competitor named in the Offer
                Notice free and clear of Great Lakes' right of first refusal as
                provided in this Agreement, but at a price not lower than, and
                on terms not substantially different from, the price and terms
                specified in the Offer Notice. However, no sale to the
                competitor named in the Offer Notice shall be made after 180
                days following the date of the Offer Notice without Great Lakes
                having again given RACC an Offer Notice and again complied in
                full with the terms of this Section 8(C).

9.      Additional Notes. In partial consideration of RACC's extinguishing and
        restructuring certain indebtedness owing to it from Great Lakes:

        (A)     Senior Note. RACC shall receive from Great Lakes a senior
                promissory note with a face amount of $5,000,000 (the "Senior
                Note"), the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit F. The
                interest rate on the Senior Note shall be eight and one quarter
                percent (8.25%) per annum. Interest shall accrue on the
                outstanding principal amount under the Senior Note and shall be
                capitalized and added to principal on the last day of each
                calendar quarter commencing on March 31, 2003. Commencing on
                March 31, 2005, interest on the Senior Note shall be payable
                quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter.
                The outstanding principal balance of the Senior Note outstanding
                on March 31, 2005 shall amortize in equal quarterly payments
                payable on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning on
                March 31, 2005 with a final maturity on December 31, 2009.

        (B)     Subordinated Note. RACC shall receive from Great Lakes a
                subordinated promissory note with a face amount of $5,000,000
                (the "Subordinated Note" and, collectively with the Group A
                Return Conditions Note, the Group B Notes, the Deferral Note,
                and the Senior Note, the "Notes"), the form of which is attached
                hereto as Exhibit G. The interest rate on the Subordinated Note
                shall be six percent (6%) per annum. For the first three years
                after the date of issuance of the Subordinated Note, interest
                shall accrue on the outstanding principal amount under the
                Subordinated Note and shall be capitalized and added to
                principal on the last day of each calendar quarter commencing on
                March 31, 2003. Interest shall be payable in cash quarterly in
                arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter commencing on
                March 31, 2006 with a bullet maturity of the outstanding
                principal on September 30, 2007. The Subordinated Note

<PAGE>

                                      -11-

                shall contain covenants (financial and otherwise) and other
                terms and conditions typical for debt of this type.

10.     Engine Fleet Maintenance Program.

        (A)     Subject to (i) the establishment of the engine management team
                as set forth in Section 10(B) below, and (ii) the EMP
                requirement set forth in Section 10(C) below, RACC hereby
                consents to Great Lakes continued operation of the engines on
                the Aircraft on an "On Condition" basis. In the event that the
                FAA withdraws its approval of Great Lakes' "On Condition"
                TBO/CBO, then RACC's consent given hereunder shall automatically
                terminate.

        (B)     On or before January 30, 2003, Great Lakes agrees to establish
                an engine management team comprised of qualified maintenance
                personnel approved by RAAS, in its reasonable discretion, to
                manage Great Lakes' "On Condition" TBO/CBO program currently
                approved by the FAA. The engine management team shall consist of
                no less than two (2) persons. The engine management team shall
                be exclusively responsible for making all maintenance decisions
                with respect to the engines, including the necessity or
                frequency of hot section inspections and overhauls. The engine
                management team shall be responsible for timely providing to
                RACC any and all information RACC may request with respect to
                the engines.

        (C)     On or before April 30, 2003, Great Lakes will enter into an
                engine maintenance plan with a third-party vendor approved by
                RACC ("EMP"), which EMP shall include at least the following
                requirements:

                (1)     Each individual engine shall be enrolled in the EMP
                        immediately following its next scheduled or unscheduled
                        overhaul. Great Lakes shall be responsible to cause a
                        complete engine (both a gas generator module and a power
                        section module) to be overhauled simultaneously, so as
                        to produce a complete zero (0) time/cycle engine to be
                        enrolled in the EMP.

                (2)     The EMP shall be a "mature rate" plan. As such, (i) the
                        EMP shall be tracked on an individual engine basis, (ii)
                        the EMP shall require that EMP payments are made for
                        each engine sufficient to pay to the vendor for parts
                        and labor to complete the next overhaul.

                (3)     The EMP, and any engine balances within the EMP, shall
                        be fully assignable and transferable with the engine. As
                        such, the

<PAGE>

                                      -12-

                        party succeeding in interest to the engine (including,
                        without limitation, RACC) shall be entitled to the full
                        benefit of any EMP engine balances, without claim by
                        Great Lakes.

                (4)     Any default by Great Lakes of the terms and conditions
                        of the EMP shall constitute a default under all
                        applicable promissory notes, security agreements,
                        finance leases and/or operating leases. Great Lakes
                        agrees to execute appropriate amendments or other
                        agreements evidencing the addition of this requirement
                        to the promissory notes, security agreements, finance
                        leases and operating leases.

11.     Prepayments.

        (A)     Mandatory Prepayments. Not later than the earlier of ninety (90)
                days after the end of each fiscal year end of Great Lakes or the
                filing of Great Lakes' Form 10-K with the Securities and
                Exchange Commission ("Form 10-K") for such fiscal year, Great
                Lakes shall prepay amounts outstanding under the Notes in an
                aggregate amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Excess Cash
                Flow for such fiscal year, accompanied by a certificate of the
                chief financial officer of Great Lakes setting forth in
                reasonable detail the calculation of Excess Cash Flow for such
                fiscal year. "Excess Cash Flow" shall mean cash flow from
                operations as determined in accordance with generally accepted
                accounting principles less capital expenditures less all
                payments in respect of funded indebtedness of Great Lakes for or
                made during such fiscal year less $250,000.

        (B)     Voluntary Prepayment. Great Lakes may prepay its obligations in
                whole or in part under this Agreement or any of the Transaction
                Documents (as defined below) at any time without penalty.

        (C)     Application of Prepayments. All prepayments made pursuant to
                Section 11(A) or 11(B) shall be applied in the following order:
                first, to the Group A Return Conditions Note until such time as
                it has been paid in full, with such prepayments being applied to
                principal, interest and other amounts owing under the Group A
                Return Conditions Note in such order or preference as RACC may
                determine; second, to the Deferral Note until such time as it
                has been paid in full, with such prepayments being applied to
                principal, interest and other amounts owing under the Deferral
                Note in such order or preference as RACC may determine; third,
                to the Senior Note until such time as it has been paid in full,

<PAGE>

                                      -13-

                preference as RACC may determine; fourth, to the Subordinated
                Note until such time as it has been paid in full, with such
                prepayments being applied to principal, interest and other
                amounts owing under the Subordinated Note in such order or
                preference as RACC may determine; and fifth, to the Group B
                Notes until such time as they have been paid in full, with such
                prepayments being applied to principal, interest and other
                amounts owing under the Group B Notes in such order or
                preference as RACC may determine; with all such prepayments to
                be applied to reduce the then-remaining installments due
                thereunder in the inverse order of scheduled maturity and, in
                the case of prepayments in respect of the Group B Notes, applied
                thereto on a pro rata basis.

                appropriate incentives with Mr. Howell and, within one hundred
                twenty (120) days following the Effective Date, with the new
                Chief Financial Officer described in clause (iv).

        (B)     Board Observer Rights. RACC shall have unlimited observer rights
                for the Great Lakes Board of Directors, subject only to being
                excused if either Great Lakes or RACC reasonably believes that
                participation would involve a conflict of interest for RACC.
                These observer rights shall not allow RACC to vote or enter into
                any discussions at any Board of Directors meeting. Without in
                any way limiting the foregoing, Great Lakes agrees to provide
                RACC with prior written notice (consistent with the notice given
                other directors) of the time, place and subject matter of any
                proposed meeting (or action by written consent) of the Board of
                Directors of Great Lakes, such notice to include true and
                complete copies of all documents furnished to any director in
                connection with such meeting or consent, provided there is

                no conflict of interest as provided above. Any two (2) of RACC's
                officers or authorized representatives will be entitled to
                attend as an observer at any such meeting or, if a meeting is
                held by telephone conference, to participate therein. Great
                Lakes also agrees to provide RACC with copies of the official
                minutes of every meeting of the Great Lakes Board of Directors
                or of resolutions taken by unanimous written consent within
                fifteen (15) days following such meeting or unanimous written
                consent, provided there is no conflict of interest as provided
                above. This Section 12(B) shall expire on the Limited
                Termination Date provided that Great Lakes is in compliance with
                this Agreement, each of the other Transaction Documents (as
                defined below) and any other agreement between itself and RACC.
                Great Lakes also agrees to hold actual shareholder meetings at
                least annually at such time and at such location as the Great
                Lakes Board of Directors may determine.

        (C)     Independent Directors. Great Lakes agrees to cause two new
                independent directors who are unaffiliated with RACC and Great
                Lakes and reasonably acceptable to RACC to be appointed to the
                Great Lakes Board of Directors by no later than March 15, 2003.
                RACC acknowledges that Mr. John Reardon is acceptable to it as
                one of the two directors.

13.     Collateral Security of Borrower. All indebtedness, obligations and
        liabilities of Great Lakes to RACC, existing on the Effective Date or
        arising thereafter, direct or indirect, joint or several, absolute or

                reduction of not less than $730,000. Evidence of the overall
                annual cost reduction under the Cost Reduction Program shall be
                set forth in reasonable detail as part of Great Lakes' annual
                officer's certificate to be delivered pursuant to Section
                15(D)(3). Great Lakes also agrees to provide evidence reasonably
                satisfactory to RACC of the closing of Great Lakes' Chicago hub
                by not later than January 30, 2003.

                        period from the beginning of the fiscal year to the
                        close of such quarter, in each case in conformity with
                        GAAP, duly certified by the principal financial officer
                        of Great Lakes.

                (2)     Annual Financial Statements. As soon as available and,
                        in any event, within ninety (90) days after the end of
                        each fiscal year, Great Lakes shall furnish to RACC

                        in conformity with GAAP setting forth in each case in
                        comparative form corresponding figures from the
                        preceding fiscal year, with all such financial
                        statements to be certified without qualification, except
                        for any qualifications so given in the past, by Great
                        Lakes' certified public accountants.

                        or Event of Default does exist, specifying the nature
                        and extent thereof and what action Great Lakes proposes
                        to take with respect thereto; (II) calculating the
                        Permitted Amount, the Debt Service Ratio, Quarterly Free
                        Cash Flow and its various components as set forth on
                        Schedule 6 as at the end of such fiscal period; (III)
                        setting forth a detailed variance analysis showing how
                        such financial statements differ from the business plan
                        delivered by Great Lakes to RACC on December 12, 2002
                        (the "Financial Plan"); and (IV) outline in reasonable
                        detail, and accompanied by supporting documentation, in
                        a manner reasonably satisfactory to RACC, demonstrating
                        Great Lakes' compliance with the Cost Reduction Program
                        requirements set forth in Section 15(C).

        (E)     Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure. This Agreement is
                confidential between the parties. Great Lakes agrees not to
                disclose the provisions of this Agreement to any person without
                the prior written consent of RACC, except (i) as may be required
                by Great Lakes in order to restructure its current debt with
                existing aircraft creditors, provided that Great Lakes may
                disclose solely the fact that its obligations to RACC are being
                restructured and the terms of the restructured debt, including,
                without limitation, RACC's receipt of the RACC Shares, but Great
                Lakes may not disclose any other details of this Agreement, (ii)
                to its legal and financial advisers and its

<PAGE>

                                      -21-

                independent public accountants (on the condition that they agree
                not to disclose such provisions) and (iii) as may be required by
                applicable law, including applicable securities law.

        (F)     No Material Transactions. Great Lakes shall not become a party
                to or agree to or effect any merger, amalgamation or
                consolidation, asset acquisition, stock acquisition, disposition
                of any of its assets or create or permit to exist any subsidiary
                unless, as a result of such disposition, all Obligations shall
                be contemporaneously paid in full in cash. This Section 15(F)
                shall expire on the Limited Termination Date provided that Great
                Lakes is in compliance with this Agreement, each of the other
                Transaction Documents and any other agreement between itself and
                RACC.

        (G)     Affiliate Transactions. Great Lakes shall not engage in any
                transaction with any affiliate, including any contract,
                agreement or other arrangement providing for the furnishing of
                services to or by, providing for rental of real or personal
                property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from
                any such affiliate or, to the knowledge of Great Lakes, any
                corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in which any
                such affiliate has a substantial interest or is an officer,
                director, trustee or partner, on terms more favorable to such
                person than would have been obtainable on an arm's-length basis
                in the ordinary course of business.

        (H)     Equity Issuances. Except for issuances pursuant to the equity
                incentive plans as described in Section 8(B) above and the
                issuance of Common Stock dividends pursuant to Section 15(B)
                above, Great Lakes shall not issue any capital stock or any
                warrants, options or other rights to acquire any of its capital
                stock or any other form of equity capital unless the terms of
                each such issuance are reasonably acceptable to RACC. Capital
                stock does not include preferred stock as described in Section
                1504(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and regulations
                thereunder, interpretations thereof and rulings applying or
                interpreting such Section.

        (I)     Further Assurances. Great Lakes will promptly furnish such
                information and execute and deliver such further documents, and
                do all other such acts as RACC may reasonably request to further
                implement the provisions contained in this Agreement, including,
                without limitation, its obligation to cooperate with RACC to
                facilitate any assignment of any of the Group B Notes pursuant
                to Section 3.

                                      -22-

        (J)     Shelf Registration. Great Lakes shall, simultaneously with the
                completion of its Form 10-K for its 2002 fiscal year, file with
                the Securities and Exchange Commission a Shelf Registration as
                to the RACC Shares and any Anti-Dilution Shares and shall use
                its best efforts thereafter to obtain and maintain the
                effectiveness of the Shelf Registration. "Shelf Registration"
                means the shelf registration pursuant to Rule 145 promulgated
                under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by Great Lakes of
                the sale by RACC (which sale, at the option of RACC in its sole
                and absolute discretion, may be through an underwriter) of the
                RACC Shares and any Anti-Dilution Shares held by RACC. In the
                event of the issuance of any Anti-Dilution Shares, Great Lakes
                will promptly either (i) amend the Shelf Registration to include
                such Anti-Dilution Shares or (ii) or file an additional Shelf
                Registration with respect to such Anti-Dilution Shares. Great
                Lakes shall not allow the effectiveness of the Shelf
                Registration to lapse at any time after its initial
                effectiveness as a result of events within Great Lakes' control.
                If, at any time after its initial effectiveness, the Shelf
                Registration shall cease to be effective as the result of events
                beyond Great Lakes' control, Great Lakes shall at all times
                thereafter use its best efforts to reinstate the effectiveness
                of the Shelf Registration.

        (K)     Incentive Compensation Plan. Great Lakes shall not adopt any
                incentive compensation plan for any of its officers that
                provides for the possibility of aggregate payments thereunder to
                any officers in any fiscal year in excess of such officer's
                current annual base salary without the prior written approval of
                RACC.

        (L)     Press Release. On or about the Effective Date, Great Lakes shall
                have issued a press release relating to the transactions
                contemplated hereby substantially in the form of Exhibit L
                attached hereto.

        (M)     Quarterly Free Cash Flow. Quarterly Free Cash Flow shall not be
                less than $(500,000).

        (N)     Debt Service Threshold. The Debt Service Threshold shall be
                calculated and maintained as set forth on Schedule 6 to this
                Agreement.

        (O)     Net Debt to EBITDA. The Net Debt to EBITDA Threshold shall be
                calculated and maintained as set forth on Schedule 6 to this
                Agreement. "Net Debt" means on balance sheet Indebtedness of
                Great Lakes, including current maturities, minus cash on hand.
                "EBITDA" means with respect to any rolling four quarter period,
                an amount equal

<PAGE>

                                      -23-

                to the sum of (a) net income of Great Lakes for such fiscal
                period, plus (b) in each case to the extent deducted in the
                calculation of Great Lakes' net income and without duplication,
                (i) depreciation and amortization for such period, plus (ii)
                income tax expense for such period, plus (iii) the aggregate
                amount of interest required to be paid or accrued by Great Lakes
                during such period on all Indebtedness of the Great Lakes and
                its subsidiaries outstanding during all or any part of such
                period, whether such interest was or is required to be reflected
                as an item of expense or capitalized, including payments
                consisting of interest in respect of any capitalized lease or
                any synthetic lease, and including commitment fees, agency fees,
                facility fees, balance deficiency fees and similar fees or
                expenses in connection with the borrowing of money, plus (iv)
                other noncash charges for such period, all as determined in
                accordance with GAAP.

        (P)     Capital Expenditures. Great Lakes shall not make Capital
                Expenditures that exceed, in the aggregate, $1,000,000 for its
                2003 fiscal year and $800,000 for each fiscal year thereafter,
                provided, however, that for each fiscal year commencing after
                the occurrence of the Limited Termination Date, Great Lakes
                shall be allowed up to $1,100,000 in Capital Expenditures per
                year. "Capital Expenditures" means amounts paid or Indebtedness
                incurred by Great Lakes in connection with the purchase or lease
                by Great Lakes of fixed assets, both tangible (such as land,
                buildings, fixtures, machinery and equipment) and intangible
                (such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, franchises and good
                will), that would be required to be capitalized and shown on its
                balance sheet in accordance with GAAP, provided that this
                Section 15(P) shall not include any item customarily charged
                directly to expense or depreciated over a useful life of twelve
                (12) months or less in accordance with GAAP.

        (Q)     Restructuring of Other Aircraft Indebtedness. As a condition to
                the effectiveness of this Agreement, Great Lakes was to have
                delivered to RACC written evidence reasonably satisfactory to
                RACC that Great Lakes' Indebtedness owing to other similarly
                situated aircraft creditors (specifically, Finova Capital, CIT
                and Boeing Capital) shall have been restructured such that none
                of these creditors shall be paid more than RACC (on a relative
                basis). Great Lakes has entered into term sheets with regard to
                restructuring its Indebtedness and other obligations with each
                of its aircraft creditors, copies of which were provided to RACC
                on December 26, 2002, the terms of which are acceptable to RACC.
                Great Lakes agrees to implement such restructurings pursuant to
                the term sheets provided to RACC, and RACC agrees to allow Great
                Lakes to implement such restructurings so long as such

<PAGE>

                                      -24-

                restructurings follow, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
                RACC, the term sheets provided to RACC on December 26, 2002. The
                failure of Great Lakes to enter into restructurings that follow
                these term sheets in a manner reasonably satisfactory to RACC
                shall constitute an Event of Default, as set forth in Section
                17(A)(3).

16.     Representations and Warranties.

        (A)     By Great Lakes. Great Lakes represents and warrants to RACC as
                of the date hereof that:

                        issuance of Anti-Dilution Shares that may be required by

                        contemplated hereby or executed pursuant hereto to which

                        contemplated hereby or executed pursuant hereto to which
                        Great Lakes is a party and the performance and
                        observance of their terms, conditions and obligations
                        have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
                        part of Great Lakes. This Agreement, the Notes, the
                        Group B Security Agreements, the Security Agreement, the
                        Security Agreement Amendment and all other Transaction
                        Documents contemplated hereby or executed pursuant
                        hereto constitute, when executed and delivered by Great
                        Lakes to RACC, will be valid and binding obligations of
                        Great Lakes enforceable in accordance with their terms
                        (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
                        moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting
                        creditors' rights generally and general principles of
                        equity).

                (2)     No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance of
                        this Agreement, the Notes, the Group B Security
                        Agreements, the Security Agreement, the Security
                        Agreement Amendment and all other Transaction Documents
                        to which Great Lakes is a party and the consummation of
                        the transactions herein contemplated on the part of
                        Great Lakes, including, without limitation, the issuance
                        to RACC of the RACC Shares and any Anti-Dilution Shares,
                        will not result in a breach or violation of any of the
                        terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under,

<PAGE>

                                      -25-

                        any statute, rule or regulation applicable to, or order
                        of any governmental body or agency or any court having
                        jurisdiction over Great Lakes or any of its properties,
                        or any agreement or instrument to which Great Lakes is a
                        party or by which Great Lakes is bound or to which any
                        of the properties of Great Lakes is subject, or the
                        charter or by-laws of Great Lakes.

                (3)     Capitalization. As of the Effective Date, the authorized
                        capital stock of Great Lakes consists solely of
                        50,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 25,000,000 shares
                        of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the
                        "Preferred Stock"), of Great Lakes. On the Effective
                        Date, Great Lakes will have no outstanding capital stock
                        other than 8,680,186 shares of Common Stock, all of
                        which shall be owned as set forth in Schedule 7 hereto
                        and shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
                        and non-assessable. Upon the issuance of any RACC Shares
                        in accordance with the terms of Section 8, such shares
                        of Common Stock shall be duly authorized, validly

                (4)     Options, Etc. Other than as disclosed on Schedule 8
                        hereto, there are no outstanding rights (either
                        preemptive or other) or options to subscribe for or
                        purchase from Great Lakes and no warrants or other
                        agreements providing for or requiring the issuance by
                        Great Lakes of any capital stock of Great Lakes. The
                        issuance of the RACC Shares or any Anti-Dilution Shares
                        shall not be subject to pre-emptive rights in favor of
                        any present or future stockholders of Great Lakes.

                (5)     Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 9 hereto,
                        there are no actions, suits, proceedings or
                        investigations of any kind pending or threatened against
                        Great Lakes before any governmental authority, that, (a)
                        if adversely determined, might, either in any case or in
                        the aggregate, (i) have a material adverse effect on the
                        business, properties, prospects, condition (financial or
                        otherwise), assets, operations or income of Great Lakes,
                        or (ii) materially impair the right of Great Lakes to
                        carry on business substantially as now conducted by
                        them, or result in any substantial liability not
                        adequately covered by insurance, or for which adequate
                        reserves are not maintained on the consolidated balance
                        sheet of Great Lakes, or (b) which question the validity
                        of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
                        Documents, or any action taken or to be taken pursuant
                        hereto or thereto.

                (6)     Net Operating Loss. The net operating loss carryover
                        ("Net Operating Loss Carryover" or "Net Operating
                        Loss"), as that term is defined by section 172 of the
                        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as currently in effect
                        (the "Code"), of Great Lakes available for use by Great
                        Lakes (subject to adjustment upon audit) in computing
                        its federal income tax liability for the year ending
                        December 31, 2002, calculated as of the beginning of
                        such year based on the tax provision for the year ended
                        December 31, 2001, is $80,308,934. Based on the
                        reasonable judgment of Great Lakes' management, the
                        amount of the Net Operating Loss for the year ended
                        December 31, 2002, after taking into account the
                        transactions contemplated under this Agreement, is
                        projected to be at least $70,000,000 (subject to
                        adjustment upon audit), but this amount cannot be
                        determined with certainty as of the date hereof because
                        of certain unknown variables, including (1) the fact
                        that the accounting and tax operating results for the
                        year ending December 31, 2002 are not finalized and (2)
                        the impact of Great Lakes restructuring its indebtedness
                        with other creditors is not known.

        (B)     By RACC. RACC represents and warrants to Great Lakes that it has
                the full power to enter into and perform its obligations under
                this Agreement and all other documents contemplated hereby or
                executed pursuant hereto. The execution and delivery of this
                Agreement and all other Transaction Documents contemplated
                hereby or executed pursuant hereto and the performance and
                observance of their terms, conditions and obligations have been
                duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of RACC.
                This Agreement and all other Transaction Documents contemplated
                hereby or executed pursuant hereto constitute, when executed and
                delivered by RACC to Great Lakes, valid and binding obligations
                of RACC, respectively, enforceable in accordance with their
                terms (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
                moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors'
                rights generally and general principles of equity).

17.     Events of Default and Remedies.

        (A)     The following events shall constitute "Events of Default" under
                this Agreement:

                (1)     The failure by any party to perform any promise,
                        agreement, obligation, warranty or covenant made by it
                        herein or in any other Transaction Document, if such
                        default is not cured by Great Lakes, on the one hand, or
                        RACC, on the other, within

<PAGE>

                                      -27-

                        thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of notice from any
                        party specifying such default; provided, however, that
                        (i) there shall be no cure period, except as otherwise
                        specifically set forth in the applicable Transaction
                        Document, with respect to any payment default by Great
                        Lakes in respect of any of the Obligations and (ii)
                        there shall be no notice or cure period with respect to
                        failure to comply with Section 12(A)(iv) and (v) of this
                        Agreement;

                (2)     Any "Event of Default" as defined in any of the
                        Transaction Documents shall have occurred; or

                (3)     If Great Lakes fails to implement restructurings with
                        each of its aircraft creditors (Finova Capital, Boeing
                        Capital and CIT) on final terms that, in a manner
                        reasonably satisfactory to RACC, implement the financial
                        and other terms set forth in the term sheets provided to
                        RACC on December 26, 2002.

        (B)     Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, a
                non-defaulting party may proceed with every remedy available at
                law or equity or provided for herein, or, in the case of RACC
                upon the occurrence of any Event of Default by Great Lakes, in
                any Transaction Document or document executed in connection
                herewith. No delay or failure of any party in the exercise of
                any right or remedy provided for hereunder shall be deemed a
                waiver of the right by such party, and no exercise or partial
                exercise or waiver of any right or remedy shall be deemed a
                waiver of any further exercise of such right or remedy or of any
                other right or remedy that RACC may have. The rights and
                remedies herein expressed are cumulative and not exclusive of
                any right or remedy that any party shall otherwise have.
                Further, nothing contained herein shall obligate any party to
                undertake any action unless required by law.

        (C)     Default Interest Rate. Upon the occurrence and during the
                continuance of any Event of Default, the outstanding principal
                under each of the Notes shall bear interest at the Default
                Interest Rate. The "Default Interest Rate" is defined as LIBOR
                plus 600 basis points.

18.     Notices. Any notice pertaining to or required by this Agreement shall be
        deemed sufficiently given if personally delivered or sent by registered
        or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the party to whom said

                any such defective provision be in any way affected or impaired
                in any other jurisdiction.

        (F)     Governing Law and Informed Choice. THIS AGREEMENT WAS MADE AND
                ENTERED INTO IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS
                TRANSACTION SHALL BE THAT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM
                TIME TO TIME EXIST. THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF KANSAS SHALL APPLY
                TO ANY AND ALL MATTERS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS
                AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED

                EXPRESSLY PROVIDED THEREIN, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT,
                SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN EITHER THE UNITED STATES
                DISTRICT COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS AT WICHITA, KANSAS OR

                be limited to the actual and direct monetary damages caused by

                indirect, special, consequential, multiple or punitive damages,
                or any damage deemed to be of an indirect or consequential

                whether grounded in tort, contract, civil law or other theories
                of liability, including strict liability. To the extent that
                this limitation of liability conflicts with any other
                provision(s) in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
                Documents, said provision(s) shall be regarded as amended to
                whatever extent required to make such provision(s) consistent
                with this Section 19(G).

                between RACC and Great Lakes concerning the subject matter

RACC
GROUP A RETURN CONDITIONS NOTE

                      RAYTHEON AIRCRAFT CREDIT CORPORATION

                                   ----------

     1.   Restructuring Agreement. Reference is hereby made to that certain
Restructuring Agreement (as amended and in effect from time to time, the
"Restructuring Agreement"), dated as of December 31, 2002, by and between Great
Lakes Aviation, Ltd., an Iowa corporation (the "Debtor"), and Raytheon Aircraft
Credit Corporation, a Kansas corporation ("RACC"). Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Restructuring Agreement.

     2.   Promise to Pay. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned hereby absolutely
and unconditionally promises to pay to the order of RACC, at 10511 East Central,
Wichita, Kansas 67206 (together with its successor and assigns hereinafter
referred to as "RACC"), in lawful money of the United States of America and in
immediately available funds, the principal sum of THREE MILLION DOLLARS
($3,000,000.00) or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the
Advances made by RACC to the Debtor pursuant to Section 2(D) of the
Restructuring Agreement (the "Principal Sum"). All payments made pursuant to
this promissory note (this "Promissory Note") will be made free and clear of,
and without deduction for, withholding, setoff, recoupment or counterclaim of
any kind.

     3.   Interest Rate. In addition to Debtor's payment of the Principal Sum,
Debtor shall pay interest to RACC on the outstanding Principal Sum at the rate
per annum equal to LIBOR plus five hundred basis points. The annual rate of
interest applicable hereunder from time to time, as specified above, is referred
to herein as the "Interest Rate." All interest shall be calculated on the basis
of a 360-day year and actual days outstanding. Notwithstanding anything set
forth in this Promissory Note to the contrary, in no event shall the rate of
interest payable pursuant to this Section 3 be higher than the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law. "LIBOR" shall mean the rate of interest
determined by RACC at which Dollar deposits for ninety (90) days are offered
based on information provided in The Wall Street Journal on the second business
day prior to the date of the issuance of this Promissory Note or the first day
of January, April, July and October, as applicable, provided, however, that if
the rate described above does not appear in The Wall Street Journal on any
applicable interest determination date,

<PAGE>

LIBOR shall be the rate determined by RACC in good faith based on the offered
rates for deposits in Dollars for ninety (90) days that are then offered by
major banks in the London interbank market. LIBOR shall be adjusted on the first
business day of each calendar quarter to reflect any increase or decrease in
LIBOR as of that date.

     4.   Late Payment Charge. While an Event of Default (as defined below) is
continuing, Debtor agrees to pay to RACC interest on the unpaid principal
balance hereunder or other amounts payable hereunder (compounded monthly and
payable on demand in respect of overdue amounts) at a rate per annum which is
equal to LIBOR plus six hundred basis points (the "Default Interest Rate") until
such Event of Default has been cured or waived in writing by RACC (after as well
as before judgment).

     5.   Repayment. The Principal Sum plus all accrued interest shall be repaid
in full by the Debtor to RACC on or before December 31, 2006 (the "Due Date").
All amounts of principal and interest not repaid by Debtor prior to December 31,
2006 shall be paid in full on the Due Date.

     6.   Taxes. All payments (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) made
by Debtor to RACC pursuant to this Promissory Note will be free and clear of and
without deduction for any taxes, levies, duties, charges, fees or withholdings
of any nature, provided, however, that taxes based on the net income of RACC are
specifically excluded from the provisions of this Section 6. If Debtor is
required by law to make any such deduction or withholding, the sum due from
Debtor will be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that RACC receives a
sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or withholding
been required. Within thirty (30) days after Debtor has made any payment from
which it is required by law to make any deduction or withholding, Debtor will
deliver to RACC a receipt issued by the applicable tax or other authority
evidencing the deduction or withholding.

     7.   Prepayment. This Promissory Note shall be subject to mandatory
prepayment from Excess Cash Flow as provided in Section 11(A) of the
Restructuring Agreement. In addition, Debtor may prepay this obligation in part
or in full at any time without any premium or penalty. Any partial prepayment
shall be applied to the installments of principal in inverse order of maturity
and in accordance with Section 11(C) of the Restructuring Agreement.

     8.   Covenants. Debtor covenants and agrees that, until the payment and
satisfaction in full of all the obligations of and amounts owed by Debtor under
this Promissory Note, Debtor will:

<PAGE>

          (a) furnish RACC with such financial information with respect to
     Debtor or the collateral described in the Security Agreements and in
     Section 13 of the Restructuring Agreement (the "Collateral") as RACC may
     reasonably request;

          (b) keep true and accurate books of account with respect to the
     Collateral and to permit RACC or its designated representatives to inspect
     the Collateral and the Aircraft and to examine and be advised as to such
     records upon the request of RACC;

          (c) comply with any law, treaty, rule, regulation or determination of
     an arbitrator, court, or other governmental authority, in each case
     applicable to or binding upon Debtor or affecting any of its property;

          (d) notify RACC promptly in writing of (i) the occurrence of any
     Default or Event of Default, (ii) any change of name or address of Debtor,
     (iii) any threatened or pending litigation or similar proceeding affecting
     Debtor or any material change in any such litigation or proceeding
     previously reported and (iv) any claims of any nature against the
     Collateral or the Aircraft; and

          (e) cooperate with RACC, take such action, execute such documents, and
     provide such information as RACC may from time to time request in order
     further to effect the transactions contemplated by and the purposes of this
     Promissory Note and the other Transaction Documents.

     9.   Security Agreement. The payment and performance of all of the
Obligations due RACC by Debtor under this Promissory Note, and any renewals,
extensions or changes hereof, including all such Obligations that would become
due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to section 362(a) of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code and the operation of sections 502(b) and 506(b) of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code and including, without limitation, post-petition
interest (collectively, the "Obligations"), shall be secured by the Corporate
Security Documents, the Group B Security Documents and any other collateral
security now or hereafter granted to RACC by the Debtor.

     10.  Purpose of Loan; Usury. Debtor warrants and represents to RACC that
this loan is for business and commercial purposes and not for personal, family,
household or agricultural purposes. It is agreed, notwithstanding any provision
to the contrary in any of the Transaction Documents, in no event will this
Promissory Note require the payment of interest or charges in excess of the
maximum amount permitted by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate") and the payment
of obligations of Debtor under this Promissory Note are hereby limited
accordingly. If under any circumstances, whether by reason of advancement or
acceleration of the maturity of

<PAGE>

the unpaid principal balance hereof or otherwise, the aggregate amounts paid on
this Promissory Note shall include amounts which by law are deemed interest and
would exceed the Maximum Rate, Debtor stipulates that payment and collection of
such excess amounts shall have been and will be deemed to have been the result
of a mistake on the part of both Debtor and RACC, and RACC shall promptly credit
such excess (to the extent only of such payments in excess of the Maximum Rate)
against the unpaid principal balance hereof and any portion of such excess
payments not capable of being so credited shall be refunded to Debtor.

     11.  Waiver. The Debtor hereby waives presentment, demand for payment,
notice of non-payment, notice of dishonor, and all other notices or demands in
connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default or endorsement of
this Promissory Note, protest and impairment of collateral, as well as diligence
in collecting this Promissory Note or enforcing any of the security therefor,
and consents to all extensions, deferrals, partial payments and refinancings
hereof before or after maturity.

     12.  Events of Default; Acceleration. If any of the following events (each
an "Event of Default") shall occur:

          (a) Debtor shall fail to pay any principal of interest on this
     Promissory Note or any other sum due under this Promissory Note, any
     Transaction Document, or any other note or other agreement between Debtor
     and RACC when the same becomes due and such failure shall continue for ten
     (10) days beyond the due date of such payment;

          (b) Debtor shall fail to perform any term, covenant or agreement
     contained in any of the Transaction Documents and such failure shall
     continue for thirty (30) days after written notice;

          (c) any representation or warranty of Debtor in any of the Transaction
     Documents or in any certificate or notice given in connection therewith
     shall have been false or misleading in any material respect at the time
     made or deemed to have been made;

          (d) Debtor shall be in default under any agreement or agreements
     evidencing (i) any other debt and similar monetary obligations (including,
     without limitation, capitalized leases, synthetic leases or securitization
     transactions) (collectively, "Indebtedness") owing to RACC or any of its
     affiliates, or (ii) any other Indebtedness in excess of $100,000.00 in
     aggregate principal amount, or shall fail to pay any such Indebtedness when
     due or within any applicable period of grace;

<PAGE>

          (e) any of the Transaction Documents shall cease to be in full force
     and effect;

          (f) Debtor (i) shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors;
     (ii) shall be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent; (iii) shall seek the
     appointment of, or be the subject of an order appointing, a trustee,
     liquidator or receiver as to all or part of its assets, (iv) shall
     commence, approve or consent to, any case or proceeding under any
     bankruptcy, reorganization or similar law and, in the case of an
     involuntary case or proceeding, such case or proceeding is not dismissed
     within forty-five (45) days following the commencement thereof, or (v)
     shall be the subject of an order for relief in an involuntary case under
     federal bankruptcy law;

          (g) Debtor shall be unable to pay its debts as they mature;

          (h) there shall remain undischarged for more than thirty (30) days any
     final judgment or execution action against Debtor that, together with other
     outstanding claims and execution actions against Debtor, respectively,
     exceeds $100,000.00 in the aggregate;

          (i) the prospect of payment or performance by Debtor or realization on
     the Collateral, in the reasonable opinion of RACC, is or becomes
     significantly impaired;

          (j) any of the Aircraft shall have been lost, stolen or confiscated or
     shall have incurred substantial damage or have been destroyed to such an
     extent that the repair thereof is impracticable (as determined solely by
     RACC); or

          (k) Debtor (i) sells, transfers or disposes of all or substantially
     all of its respective stock, assets or property, (ii) becomes the subject
     of, or engages in, a leveraged buy-out, or (iii) terminates its existence
     by merger, reorganization or consolidation.

          THEN, or at any time thereafter:

          (1) In the case of any Event of Default under clauses (f) or (g), the
     entire unpaid principal amount of this Promissory Note and all other
     amounts payable hereunder, shall automatically become forthwith due and
     payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of
     which are hereby expressly waived by Debtor; and

          (2) In the case of any Event of Default other than under clauses (f)
     or (g), RACC may, by written notice to Debtor, declare the unpaid principal

<PAGE>

     amount of this Promissory Note and all other amounts payable hereunder, to
     be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
     further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
     Debtor.

     In addition to and without in any way limiting the foregoing, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter, RACC may employ all
remedies allowed by law, including, without limitation, those available to a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code. No remedy herein conferred upon
RACC is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy
shall be cumulative and in addition to every other remedy hereunder, now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.

     13.  Obligations Absolute. Debtor's payment and performance obligations
under this Promissory Note and the other Transaction Documents are absolute and
unconditional. Any claim that Debtor may now or hereafter have against RACC or
any affiliate thereof arising out of or in connection with the Aircraft, any of
the other Collateral or any other matter shall not affect or excuse the
unconditional obligation of Debtor to make any payment required to be made to
RACC under the Transaction Documents, and shall not be used or asserted as a
defense to payment of such obligation or as set-off, counterclaim or deduction
against such payment. RACC shall have no obligation or responsibility with
respect to any dispute that may arise between Debtor and any such foregoing
person, and no such dispute shall prevent RACC from taking such action as it may
deem appropriate in order to preserve, protect or enforce its rights hereunder.

     14.  Debtor's Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, Etc. Debtor further
agrees to pay to RACC, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs
and legal expenses) incurred or expended by RACC in connection with the
Obligations, this Promissory Note and the enforcement hereof, together with
interest on amounts recoverable under this Section 14 from the time when such
amounts become due until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the
Default Interest Rate, provided that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount
permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced
to such maximum permitted amount.

     15.  Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective
unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of the same
default in the future.

     16.  Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any change of
address from that shown herein within ten (10) days of such change.

<PAGE>

RACC
[AMENDED AND RESTATED] PROMISSORY NOTE

                      RAYTHEON AIRCRAFT CREDIT CORPORATION

                                   ----------

1. Promise to Pay. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned (hereinafter referred to
as "Debtor") hereby absolutely and unconditionally promises to pay to the order
of Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation, at 10511 East Central, Wichita, Kansas
67206 (together with its successor and assigns hereinafter referred to as
"RACC"), in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately
available funds, the principal sum of TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
($2,500,000), together with interest on the principal amount outstanding
hereunder from the date hereof as specified below, until paid in full. All
payments made pursuant to this Promissory Note will be made free and clear of,
and without deduction for, withholding, setoff, recoupment or counterclaim of
any kind.

2. Rate of Interest; Late Payment Charge. Debtor agrees to pay to RACC interest
on the unpaid principal balance hereunder, as follows:

          A.   The rate of interest of this Promissory Note shall be LIBOR plus
               three hundred seventy five (375) basis points per annum. "LIBOR"
               shall mean the rate of interest determined by RACC at which
               Dollar deposits for ninety (90) days are offered based on
               information provided in The Wall Street Journal on the second
               business day prior to the date of the issuance of this Promissory
               Note or the first day of January, April, July and October, as
               applicable, provided, however, that if the rate described above
               does not appear in The Wall Street Journal on any applicable
               interest determination date, LIBOR shall be the rate determined
               by RACC in good faith based on the offered rates for deposits in
               Dollars for ninety (90) days that are then offered by major banks
               in the London interbank market. LIBOR shall be adjusted on the
               first business day of each calendar quarter to reflect any
               increase or decrease in LIBOR as of that date.

          B.   On each Calculation Date (as defined in Schedule 1 attached
               hereto), the rate of interest of this Promissory Note shall be
               adjusted, if necessary, to LIBOR plus the Applicable Percentage
               as defined in Schedule 1.

          C.   Notwithstanding the foregoing Clauses A and B, while an Event of
               Default (as defined in Section 13) is continuing, the principal
               outstanding hereunder and, to the extent permitted by applicable
               law, any overdue interest or other amounts payable hereunder
               shall bear interest (compounded monthly and payable on demand in
               respect of overdue amounts) at a rate per annum which is LIBOR
               plus six hundred (600) basis points (the "Default Interest Rate")
               until such Event of Default has been cured or waived in writing
               by RACC (after as well as before judgment).

All interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days
outstanding. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Promissory Note to the
contrary, in no event shall the rate of interest payable pursuant to this
Section 2 be higher than the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

<PAGE>

3. Payment Schedule. Payment of the principal balance together with accrued
interest shall be made in 120 consecutive monthly installments payable in
arrears. The first installment payment shall be due and payable to RACC on
January 15, 2002. Each subsequent installment payment shall be due and payable
to RACC on the fifteenth day of each month thereafter, until December 15, 2012,
when the entire remaining balance of principal and interest shall be paid in
full. The amount of each installment payment will be $25,500, with the amount to
be adjusted quarterly based on changes in the underlying interest rate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of loss, theft, confiscation or
substantial damage to the Aircraft, Debtor shall pay all amounts owing under
this Promissory Note within thirty (30) days following demand by RACC.

4. Taxes. All payments (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) made by
Debtor to RACC pursuant to this Promissory Note will be free and clear of and
without deduction for any taxes, levies, duties, charges, fees or withholdings
of any nature, provided, however, that taxes based on the net income of RACC are
specifically excluded from the provisions of this Section 4. If Debtor is
required by law to make any such deduction or withholding, the sum due from
Debtor will be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that RACC receives a
sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or withholding
been required. Within thirty (30) days after Debtor has made any payment from
which it is required by law to make any deduction or withholding, Debtor will
deliver to RACC a receipt issued by the applicable tax or other authority
evidencing the deduction or withholding.

5. Prepayment. Debtor may prepay this obligation in part or in full at any time
without any premium or penalty. Any partial prepayment shall be first applied to
accrued interest and then to the installments of principal in inverse order of
maturity.

6. Disclaimer. If the Aircraft (as hereinafter defined) does not operate as
warranted, becomes obsolete, or the Aircraft is unsatisfactory for any reason
whatsoever, Debtor shall make all claims on account thereof solely against RAC
and not against RACC and Debtor shall nevertheless pay all sums payable
hereunder. Debtor acknowledges that neither RAC nor any sales representative or
agent thereof, is an agent of RACC and no agreement or representation as to the
Aircraft or any other matter by any such sales representative or agent of RAC
shall in any way affect Debtor's obligations hereunder.

DEBTOR HAS SELECTED THE AIRCRAFT AND NEGOTIATED ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE
PURCHASE THEREOF ALL INDEPENDENTLY FROM RACC AND WITHOUT ANY PROMPTING, REFERRAL
OR SUGGESTION FROM RACC. RACC HAS SOLELY PROVIDED A FINANCIAL ACCOMMODATION TO
DEBTOR UNDER THIS NOTE AND HAS NOT ACTED AS AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO HAVE
ACTED AS ADVISOR, ARRANGER, PROMOTER OR GUARANTOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASE
OF THE AIRCRAFT FROM RAC OR ANY ASPECT THEREOF.

          contract rights, general intangibles, accounts, cash, and goods, all

10. Purpose of Loan; Usury. [The purpose of this Promissory Note is to finance
the Debtor's acquisition of the Aircraft.] [USE THIS LANGUAGE IF AIRCRAFT WAS
PREVIOUSLY SUBJECT TO A LEASE] [The purpose of the Promissory Note dated
_________ issued by the Debtor to RACC (the "Original Note") was to finance the
Debtor's acquisition of the Aircraft. This Promissory Note amends and restates
and has been issued in substitution as a replacement for the Original Note.
Nothing contained herein or in any other document shall be construed to
constitute the payment or discharge of the Original Note or to release or
terminate any lien, mortgage, pledge or other security interest in favor of RACC
relating to the Original Note.] [USE THIS LANGUAGE IF AIRCRAFT IS ALREADY
SUBJECT TO A NOTE] Debtor warrants and represents to RACC that this loan is for
business and commercial purposes and not for personal, family, household or
agricultural purposes. It is agreed, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in this Promissory Note or the Security Agreement, in no event will
this Promissory Note or the Security Agreement require the payment of interest
or charges in excess of the maximum amount permitted by applicable law (the
"Maximum Rate") and the payment of obligations of Debtor under this Promissory
Note and the Security Agreement are hereby limited accordingly. If under any
circumstances, whether by reason of advancement or acceleration of the maturity
of the unpaid principal balance hereof or otherwise, the aggregate amounts paid
on this Promissory Note or pursuant to the Security Agreement shall include
amounts which by law are deemed interest and would exceed the Maximum Rate,
Debtor stipulates that payment and collection of such excess amounts shall have
been and will be deemed to have been the result of a mistake on the part of both
Debtor and RACC, and RACC shall promptly credit such excess (to the extent only
of such payments in excess of the Maximum Rate) against the unpaid principal
balance hereof and any portion of such excess payments not capable of being so
credited shall be refunded to Debtor.

11. Principals and Waivers. All signers, makers, guarantors, endorsers and
sureties hereof are to be regarded as principals, jointly and severally. Every
maker, endorser, guarantor and surety hereof hereby waives presentment, demand
for payment, notice of non-payment, notice of dishonor, and all other notices or
demands in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default or
endorsement of this Promissory Note, protest and impairment of collateral, as
well as diligence in collecting this Promissory Note or enforcing any of the
security therefor, and consents to all extensions, deferrals, partial payments
and refinancings hereof before or after maturity.

12. Events of Default; Acceleration. If any of the following events (each an
"Event of Default") shall occur:

          (a)  Debtor shall fail to pay any principal of or interest on this
               Promissory Note or any other sum due under this Promissory Note
               or any other note or other agreement between Debtor and RACC when
               the same becomes due and such failure shall continue for ten (10)
               days beyond the due date of such payment;

          (b)  Debtor shall fail to perform any term, covenant or agreement
               contained in any of the Transaction Documents and such failure
               shall continue for thirty (30) days after written notice;

          (c)  Debtor shall fail to maintain insurance pursuant to terms of the
               Security Agreement;

<PAGE>

          (d)  any representation or warranty of Debtor in any of the
               Transaction Documents or in any certificate or notice given in
               connection therewith shall have been false or misleading in any
               material respect at the time made or deemed to have been made;

          (e)  Debtor shall be in default under any agreement or agreements
               evidencing (i) any other debt and similar monetary obligations
               (including, without limitation, capitalized leases, synthetic
               leases or securitization transactions) (collectively,
               "Indebtedness") owing to RACC or any affiliates of RACC,
               including, without limitation, Raytheon Travel Air Company, or
               (ii) any other Indebtedness in excess of $100,000.00 in aggregate
               principal amount, or shall fail to pay any such Indebtedness when
               due or within any applicable period of grace;

          (f)  any of the Transaction Documents shall cease to be in full force
               and effect;

          (g)  Debtor (i) shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors;

               proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar law
               and, in the case of an involuntary case or proceeding, such case
               or proceeding is not dismissed within forty-five (45) days
               following the commencement thereof, or (v) shall be the subject
               of an order for relief in an involuntary case under federal
               bankruptcy law;

          (h)  Debtor shall be unable to pay its debts as they mature;

          (i)  there shall remain undischarged for more than thirty (30) days
               any final judgment or execution action against Debtor that,
               together with other outstanding claims and execution actions
               against Debtor exceeds $100,000.00 in the aggregate;

          (j)  the prospect of payment or performance by Debtor of realization
               on the Collateral, in the reasonable opinion of RACC, is or
               becomes significantly impaired; or

          (k)  Debtor (i) sells, transfers or disposes of all or substantially
               all of its respective stock, assets or property, (ii) becomes the
               subject of, or engages in, a leveraged buy-out, or (iii)
               terminates its existence by merger, reorganization or
               consolidation; or if Debtor is a privately held company, control
               of Debtor's voting capital stock issued and outstanding from time
               to time is not retained by the holders thereof on the date
               hereof.

THEN, or at any time thereafter:

          (1)  In the case of any Event of Default under clauses (g) or (h), the
               entire unpaid principal amount of this Promissory Note, all
               interest accrued and unpaid thereof, and all other amounts
               payable hereunder and under the Security Agreement, as well as
               any other indebtedness or liability of Debtor owed to RACC, shall
               automatically become forthwith due and payable, without
               presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which
               are hereby expressly waived by Debtor; and

          (2)  In the case of any Event of Default other than under clauses (g)
               or (h), RACC may, by written notice to Debtor, declare the unpaid
               principal amount of this Promissory Note, all interest accrued
               and unpaid thereof, and all other amounts payable hereunder and
               under the Security Agreement, as well as any other indebtedness
               or liability of Debtor owed to RACC, to be forthwith due and
               payable, without

<PAGE>

               presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all
               of which are hereby expressly waived by Debtor.

In addition to and without in any way limiting the foregoing, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter, RACC may employ all
remedies allowed by law, including, without limitation, those available to a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code. No remedy herein conferred upon
RACC is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy
shall be cumulative and in addition to every other remedy hereunder, now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.

13. Obligations Absolute. Debtor's payment and performance obligations under
this Promissory Note are absolute and unconditional. Any claim that Debtor may
now or hereafter have against RACC or any affiliate thereof arising out of or in
connection with the Aircraft, any of the other Collateral or any other matter
shall not affect or excuse the unconditional obligation of Debtor to make any
payment required to be made to RACC under this Promissory Note or the Security
Agreement, and shall not be used or asserted as a defense to payment of such
obligation or as set-off, counterclaim or deduction against such payment. RACC
shall have no obligation or responsibility with respect to any dispute that may
arise between Debtor and any such foregoing person, and no such dispute shall
prevent RACC from taking such action as it may deem appropriate in order to
preserve, protect or enforce its rights hereunder.

14. Debtor's Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, etc. Debtor further agrees to
pay to RACC, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs and legal
expenses) incurred or expended by RACC in connection with the Obligations, this
Promissory Note and the enforcement hereof, together with interest on amounts
recoverable under this Section 14 from the time when such amounts become due
until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the Default Interest Rate,
provided that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount permitted to be paid
under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced to such maximum
permitted amount.

15. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective
unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of the same
default in the future.

16. Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any change of
address from that shown herein within 10 days of such change.

17. GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS AGREEMENT WAS MADE AND ENTERED INTO
IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS TRANSACTION SHALL BE THAT OF
THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXIST. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE

OF KANSAS AT WICHITA, KANSAS, OR IN THE EIGHTEENTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF
SEDGWICK COUNTY, KANSAS, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER COURTS AND TRIBUNALS.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IN THE EVENT AN EVENT OF DEFAULT SHOULD OCCUR, RACC
(AT ITS SOLE OPTION) MAY INSTITUTE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN ANY JURISDICTION AS MAY
BE APPROPRIATE IN ORDER FOR RACC TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL. THE
PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT AND AGREE TO BE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE
AFORESAID COURTS IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS.

18. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL. ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
VOLUNTARILY, KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR

19. Damages. To the extent that any party hereto is subject to liability for any
breach under this Agreement, the liability of such party shall be limited to the
actual and direct monetary damages caused by such breach. In no event shall any
party hereto be liable for indirect, special, consequential, multiple or
punitive damages, or any damage deemed to be of an indirect or consequential
nature arising out of or related to its performance hereunder, whether based
upon breach of contract, warranty, negligence and whether grounded in tort,
contract, civil law or other theories of liability, including strict liability.
To the extent that this limitation of liability conflicts with any other
provision(s) in this Agreement, said provision(s) shall be regarded as amended
to whatever extent required to make such provision(s) consistent with this
Section 19.

20. Enforceability. The unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not
affect the validity of any other provision hereof.

21. Binding Agreement. All obligations of Debtor hereunder shall bind the heirs,
agents and attorneys-in-fact, successors and assigns of Debtor. If there be more
than one Debtor, their liabilities shall be joint and several. All rights of
RACC hereunder shall inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns.

22. Assignment. RACC may transfer or assign all or any part of its interest in
this Promissory Note, including any guaranties, without the consent of Debtor or
any other party. Debtor shall not sell, assign, transfer, encumber or convey any
of its interests in the Collateral or in this Promissory Note without the prior
written consent of RACC.

Service Ratio (as defined in the Restructuring Agreement); provided, that such
new Tier Level shall be effective only from the fifth Business Day following the
date of delivery of such officer's certificate and no interest paid at the
higher Tier Level shall be rebated to Debtor. Except as set forth above, each
Applicable Percentage shall be effective from one Calculation Date until the

interest in the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly titled
and registered and the security interest perfected to RACC's reasonable
satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in
all public offices where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable.

4. Operation, Maintenance and Repair. Debtor shall operate, maintain and repair

certificated and qualified pilots and shall maintain U.S. registry and shall be
based within the geographical boundaries of the United States.

    4c. Debtor shall be responsible for and pay for all expenses of owning and
operating the Collateral, including but not limited to storage, fuel,
lubricants, service, inspections, overhauls, replacements, maintenance and
repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturer's operating and maintenance
manuals, and in compliance with operating and maintenance manuals approved by
the FAA, and with FAA rules and regulations. Debtor shall properly maintain all
records pertaining to the maintenance and operation of the Collateral.

    4d. Debtor will use reasonable care to prevent the Aircraft from being
damaged or injured and will promptly (but in no event later than 60 days after
discovery) replace any part or component of the Aircraft that may be damaged,
worn out, lost, destroyed, confiscated or otherwise rendered unsatisfactory or
unavailable for use.

5. Insurance. Debtor shall, at all times and at its sole expense, obtain and
carry the types and amounts of insurance coverage specified below:

         (a)      "All Risk" type hull insurance on the Aircraft in the kind and
                  form satisfactory to RACC, including Comprehensive Ground and
                  Flight Coverage and Fire and Extended Risk Coverage, both
                  In-Flight and Not In-Flight, in amounts not less than the
                  unpaid principal balance owed under the Promissory Note plus
                  interest. All policies of insurance carried in accordance with
                  this paragraph (a) shall name RACC as a Loss Payee and provide
                  that the insurance proceeds from any loss involving the
                  Aircraft shall be paid as follows (1) any loss not exceeding
                  U.S. $100,000.00 shall be payable to Debtors with notice to
                  RACC; (2) any loss exceeding $100,000.00 shall be jointly
                  payable to RACC and Debtor, and (3) any total loss of the
                  Aircraft shall be payable solely to RACC up to the amount of
                  the unpaid principal sum and accrued interest and other
                  charges owed by Debtor under the Promissory Note. The policies
                  shall include coverage against the perils of strikes, riots,
                  civil commotions or labor disturbances, and any act of
                  vandalism outside of the United States. The policies shall
                  also specify that (i) any losses shall be adjusted by the
                  insurer with the Debtor, with notice thereof being provided to
                  RACC and the Aircraft manufacturer, and (ii) RACC and the
                  Aircraft manufacturer shall have the right to fully inspect
                  the Aircraft prior to, during and after repair of any loss
                  involving the Aircraft.

         (b)      Legal liability insurance, in the kind and form satisfactory
                  to RACC, with limits no less than $50,000,000.00 of combined
                  single limit per occurrence, for bodily injury and property
                  damage (including passengers). All policies of insurance
                  carried in accordance with this paragraph (b) shall name
                  Debtor as the primary insured and RACC as an additional
                  insured thereunder.

All policies maintained by Debtor in accordance with subsections (a) and (b)
above shall also comply with the following requirements:

         (1)      be issued by insurers of recognized responsibility which are
                  satisfactory to RACC;

         (2)      provide that if such insurance is canceled for any reason
                  whatsoever, or any substantial change is made in policy terms,
                  conditions or coverage, or the policy is allowed to lapse for
                  nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change or lapse
                  shall not be effective as to RACC until thirty (30) days after
                  RACC's receipt of written

<PAGE>

                  notice from Debtor's insurers of the cancellation, change or
                  lapse in policy terms, conditions or coverage;

         (3)      provide that in respect of the interest of RACC in such
                  policies, the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action
                  or inaction of Debtor and shall insure RACC regardless of any
                  breach or violation by Debtor of any warranty, declaration or
                  condition contained in such policies;

         (4)      be primary without right of contribution from any other
                  insurance which is carried by RACC with respect to its
                  interest in the Aircraft;

         (5)      waive any right of subrogation of the insurer against RACC;
                  provided, however, that the right of subrogation shall not be
                  waived with respect to any acts or omissions on the part of
                  RACC or the manufacturer of the Aircraft (or any of its
                  subsidiaries) related to products sold, handled, distributed,
                  repaired, serviced or maintained by said parties;

         (6)      provide that the geographic limits, if any, contained in such
                  policy shall include at a minimum all territories over which
                  Debtor will operate the Aircraft; and

         (7)      provide that RACC shall have no obligation or liability for
                  premiums, commissions, assessments or calls in connection with
                  such insurance policies.

Debtors shall furnish to RACC evidence of the aforesaid insurance coverage in
certificate form. Evidence of renewal of each policy shall thereafter be
furnished to RACC in certificate form. Debtor covenants that it will not do any
act or voluntarily suffer or permit any act to be done whereby any insurance
required hereunder shall or may be suspended, impaired or defeated. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may,
at its option, apply insurance proceeds, in whole or in part, to (i) repair or
replace the Aircraft or any part thereof or (ii) satisfy any or all of the
Obligations. Any surplus proceeds are to be paid to Debtor.

6. Power of Attorney. Debtor hereby appoints RACC and its assigns or their
designated agent as Debtor's attorney-in-fact, irrevocably, with full power of
substitution, to collect all payments with respect to the Collateral, to receive
all moneys (including, but not limited to, refunds or proceeds of insurance)
that may become due under any policy insuring the Collateral and all awards
payable in connection with the condemnation, requisition or seizure of the
Collateral, or any part thereof, to execute proofs of claim, to endorse drafts,
checks and other instruments for the payment of money payable to Debtor in
payment of such insurance moneys and to do all other acts, things, take any
actions (including the filing of financing statements or other documents,
including, without limitation, those documents referred to in Section 3 hereof)
or institute any proceedings that RACC may deem to be necessary or appropriate
at any time to protect and preserve the interest of RACC in the Collateral, or
in this Security Agreement or the Promissory Note.

7. Debtor's Possession. Until default, Debtor may have possession of the
Collateral and use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Security
Agreement. RACC may examine and inspect the Collateral, wherever located, at all
reasonable times. At its option, but without assuming any obligation to do so,
RACC may discharge taxes, liens or security interests, or other encumbrances
levied or asserted against the Collateral, may place and pay for insurance
thereon, may order and pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof,
and may pay any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under
the preceding sentence shall be added to Debtor's unpaid balance under the
Promissory Note, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall be payable upon
demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2
of the Promissory Note until paid in full. Debtor shall at all times keep the
Collateral, and any proceeds therefrom, separate and

<PAGE>

distinct from other property of the Debtor and shall keep accurate and complete
records of the Collateral and any such proceeds.

8. Indemnity. Debtor assumes liability for, and hereby agrees to indemnify,
protect, save, defend and keep harmless RACC, its agents, employees, officers,
directors, shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns (for
purposes of this Section 8, collectively "RACC"), on a net after-tax basis, from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims (including, without limitation, claims involving or alleging product
liability or strict or absolute liability in tort), actions, suits, demands,
costs, expenses and disbursements (including, without limitation, legal fees and
expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever ("Claims") which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against RACC, whether or not RACC shall also be
indemnified as to any such Claim by any other Person, in any way relating to or
arising hereunder, any other Transaction Document or any other documents
contemplated hereby or thereby, or the performance or enforcement of any of the
terms hereof or thereof, or in any way relating to or arising out of any
Transaction Document or the performance or enforcement of any of the terms
hereof or thereof, or in any way relating to or arising out of the assertion or
enforcement of any manufacturer's, vendor's or dealer's warranties on the
Aircraft or any part thereof (including, without limitation, any warranty of
RAC), or in any way relating to or arising out of the manufacture, inspection,
construction, purchase, pooling, interchange, acceptance, rejection, ownership,
titling or re-titling, delivery, lease, sublease, possession, use, operation,
maintenance, management, condition, registration or re-registration, sale,
return, removal, repossession, storage or other disposition of the Aircraft or
part thereof or any accident in connection therewith (including, without
limitation, latent and other defects, whether or not discoverable, and any Claim
for patent, trademark or copyright infringement).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Debtor shall not be required to indemnify RACC
for (a) any Claim caused solely and directly by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the RACC or (b) any Claim in respect of the Aircraft arising from
acts or events which occur after any and all other obligations of any kind
whatsoever of Debtor hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents have
been fully paid and/or performed, as the case may be, unless any such Claims
were caused by Debtor (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
successor, assignee, agent or servant of Debtor) or resulted or arose, directly
or indirectly, from any acts, events or omissions of any kind whatsoever during
the term hereof.

The liability of Debtor to make indemnification payments shall, notwithstanding
any expiration or other termination (whether voluntary, as the result of an
Event of Default, or otherwise) hereof or any of the other Transaction
Documents, continue to exist until such indemnity payments are irrevocably made
in full by Debtor and received by RACC. If any Claim is made against Debtor or
RACC, the party receiving notice of such Claim shall promptly notify the other,
but the failure of the party receiving notice to so notify the other shall not
relieve Debtor of any obligation hereunder.

9. Event of Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in
the Promissory Note, (a) RACC shall have the right to exercise all remedies
allowed by law, including, without limitation, those available to a secured
party under the Uniform Commercial Code and (b) RACC may require Debtor to
assemble the Collateral and make it available to RACC at a place to be
designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both parties. The
requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification
to Debtor of the time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or
of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be
made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's
address, as shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale
or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable expenses of retaking, holding,
preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with
reasonable costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and
after the payment of the principal and interest due under the Promissory Note,
the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be

<PAGE>

applied to the payment of any or all other Obligations, and to the satisfaction
of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the Collateral
of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor
shall be liable for any deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the
extent permitted by law. After the occurrence of an Event of Default, Debtor
agrees that, RACC may fly or otherwise move the Aircraft for demonstration and
other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other
disposition of the Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RACC may at its
option and in its sole discretion keep idle, lease, or use or operate the
Aircraft without any liability whatsoever. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, Debtor hereby waives any rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or
otherwise which may require RACC to sell, lease or otherwise use the Aircraft in
mitigation of RACC's damages as set forth in this Section or otherwise provided
herein or which may otherwise limit or modify any of RACC's rights or remedies
under this Section or otherwise provided herein.

10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective
unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of the same
default in the future.

11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written
consent of RACC, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any
interest therein, or offer to do so or permanently remove or attempt to
permanently remove the Collateral from the United States. Debtor will keep the
Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will
not permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied.

12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes
and assessments upon the Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this
Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the Promissory Note.

13. Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any change of
address from that shown in this Security Agreement within ten (10) days of such
change.

14. GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT WAS MADE AND
ENTERED INTO IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS TRANSACTION SHALL
BE THAT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXIST. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECURITY
AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN EITHER THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT
COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS AT WICHITA, KANSAS, OR IN THE EIGHTEENTH
JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF SEDGWICK COUNTY, KANSAS, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL
OTHER COURTS AND TRIBUNALS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IN THE EVENT AN "EVENT OF
DEFAULT" SHOULD OCCUR, RACC (AT ITS SOLE OPTION) MAY INSTITUTE A LEGAL
PROCEEDING IN ANY JURISDICTION AS MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN ORDER FOR RACC TO OBTAIN
POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT AND AGREE TO BE SUBJECT
TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS.

15. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL. ALL PARTIES TO THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT HEREBY
VOLUNTARILY, KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR OTHER RIGHT
EACH MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION CONCERNING THIS
SECURITY AGREEMENT.

16. Damages. To the extent that any party hereto is subject to liability for any
breach under this Security Agreement, the liability of such party shall be
limited to the actual and direct monetary damages caused by such breach. In no
event shall any party hereto be liable for indirect, special,

<PAGE>

consequential, multiple or punitive damages, or any damage deemed to be of an
indirect or consequential nature arising out of or related to its performance
hereunder, whether based upon breach of contract, warranty, negligence and
whether grounded in tort, contract, civil law or other theories of liability,
including strict liability. To the extent that this limitation of liability
conflicts with any other provision(s) in this Security Agreement, said
provision(s) shall be regarded as amended to whatever extent required to make
such provision(s) consistent with this Section 16.

17. Enforceability. The unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not
affect the validity of any other provision hereof.

18. Binding Agreement. All obligations of Debtor hereunder shall bind the heirs,
agents and attorneys-in-fact, successors and assigns of Debtor. If there be more
than one Debtor, their liabilities shall be joint and several. All rights of
RACC hereunder shall inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns.

19. Assignment. RACC may transfer or assign all or any part of its interest in
this Security Agreement without the consent of Debtor or any other party. Debtor
shall not sell, assign, transfer, encumber or convey any of its interests in the
Collateral or in this Security Agreement without the prior written consent of
RACC.

20. Entire Agreement. This Security Agreement and the Promissory Note constitute
the entire agreement between and among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof. There are no verbal understandings, agreements, representations
or warranties not expressly set forth herein. Neither this Security Agreement
nor the Promissory Note shall be changed orally, but only by writing signed by
the parties hereto.

21. Miscellaneous. Time is of the essence hereof. RACC's failure to insist on
performance of any of the terms and conditions contained in this Security
Agreement or the Promissory Note or to exercise any right or benefit will not
constitute a waiver unless the waiver is in writing, executed by an authorized
representative of RACC. RACC's waiver of any default hereunder or thereunder

RACC
DEFERRAL NOTE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      RAYTHEON AIRCRAFT CREDIT CORPORATION

                                   ----------

         1.   Restructuring Agreement. Reference is hereby made to that certain
Restructuring Agreement (as amended and in effect from time to time, the
"Restructuring Agreement"), dated as of December 31, 2002, by and between Great
Lakes Aviation, Ltd., an Iowa corporation (the "Debtor") and Raytheon Aircraft
Credit Corporation, a Kansas corporation ("RACC"). Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Restructuring Agreement.

         2.   Promise to Pay. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned hereby
absolutely and unconditionally promises to pay to the order of RACC, at 10511
East Central, Wichita, Kansas 67206 (together with its successor and assigns
hereinafter referred to as "RACC"), in lawful money of the United States of
America and in immediately available funds, the principal sum of ONE MILLION TWO
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,200,000.00) (the "Principal Sum"). All payments
made pursuant to this promissory note (this "Promissory Note") will be made free
and clear of, and without deduction for, withholding, setoff, recoupment or
counterclaim of any kind.

         3.   Interest Rate. In addition to Debtor's payment of the Principal
Sum, Debtor shall pay interest to RACC on the outstanding Principal Sum at the
rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus three hundred seventy five basis points.
Interest on this Promissory Note shall be payable in cash quarterly in arrears
on the last day of each calendar quarter commencing on March 31, 2003. The
annual rate of interest applicable hereunder from time to time, as specified
above, is referred to herein as the "Interest Rate." All interest shall be
calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days outstanding.
Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Promissory Note to the contrary, in
no event shall the rate of interest payable pursuant to this Section 3 be higher
than the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. "LIBOR" shall mean the
rate of interest determined by RACC at which Dollar deposits for ninety (90)
days are offered based on information provided in The Wall Street Journal on the
second business day prior to the date of the issuance of this Promissory Note or
the first day of January, April, July and October, as applicable, provided,
however, that if the rate described above does not

<PAGE>

appear in The Wall Street Journal on any applicable interest determination date,
LIBOR shall be the rate determined by RACC in good faith based on the offered
rates for deposits in Dollars for ninety (90) days that are then offered by
major banks in the London interbank market. LIBOR shall be adjusted on the first
business day of each calendar quarter to reflect any increase or decrease in
LIBOR as of that date.

         4.   Late Payment Charge. While an Event of Default (as defined below)
is continuing, Debtor agrees to pay to RACC interest on the unpaid principal
balance hereunder or other amounts payable hereunder (compounded monthly and
payable on demand in respect of overdue amounts) at a rate per annum which is
equal to LIBOR plus six hundred basis points (the "Default Interest Rate") until
such Event of Default has been cured or waived in writing by RACC (after as well
as before judgment).

         5.   Repayment. The Principal Sum shall be paid by the Debtor to RACC
in quarterly payments at the end of each calendar quarter commencing on June 30,
2003. In 2003, Debtor shall make three principal payments on June 30, September
30 and December 31 of $133,333.33 each, in 2004, there shall be four quarterly
principal payments of $125,000 each and in 2005, there shall be four quarterly
principal payments of $75,000 each, with the last such payment due on December
31, 2005 (the "Due Date"). All amounts of principal and interest not repaid by
Debtor prior to December 31, 2005 shall be paid in full on the Due Date.

         6.   Taxes. All payments (whether of principal, interest or otherwise)
made by Debtor to RACC pursuant to this Promissory Note will be free and clear
of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, duties, charges, fees or
withholdings of any nature, provided, however, that taxes based on the net
income of RACC are specifically excluded from the provisions of this Section 6.
If Debtor is required by law to make any such deduction or withholding, the sum
due from Debtor will be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that RACC
receives a sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or
withholding been required. Within thirty (30) days after Debtor has made any
payment from which it is required by law to make any deduction or withholding,
Debtor will deliver to RACC a receipt issued by the applicable tax or other
authority evidencing the deduction or withholding.

         7.   Prepayment. This Promissory Note shall be subject to mandatory
prepayment from Excess Cash Flow as provided in Section 11(A) of the
Restructuring Agreement. In addition, Debtor may prepay this obligation in part
or in full at any time without any premium or penalty. Any partial prepayment
shall be applied to the installments of principal in inverse order of maturity
and in accordance with Section 11(C) of the Restructuring Agreement.

<PAGE>

         8.   Covenants. Debtor covenants and agrees that, until the payment and
satisfaction in full of all the obligations of and amounts owed by Debtor under
this Promissory Note, Debtor will:

              (a)   furnish RACC with such financial information with respect to
         Debtor or the collateral described in the Security Agreements and in
         Section 13 of the Restructuring Agreement (the "Collateral") as RACC
         may reasonably request;

              (b)   keep true and accurate books of account with respect to the
         Collateral and to permit RACC or its designated representatives to
         inspect the Collateral and the Aircraft and to examine and be advised
         as to such records upon the request of RACC;

              (c)   comply with any law, treaty, rule, regulation or
         determination of an arbitrator, court, or other governmental authority,
         in each case applicable to or binding upon Debtor or affecting any of
         its property;

              (d)   notify RACC promptly in writing of (i) the occurrence of any
         Default or Event of Default, (ii) any change of name or address of
         Debtor, (iii) any threatened or pending litigation or similar
         proceeding affecting Debtor or any material change in any such
         litigation or proceeding previously reported and (iv) any claims of any
         nature against the Collateral or the Aircraft; and

              (e)   cooperate with RACC, take such action, execute such
         documents, and provide such information as RACC may from time to time
         request in order further to effect the transactions contemplated by and
         the purposes of this Promissory Note and the other Transaction
         Documents.

         9.   Security Agreement. The payment and performance of all of the
Obligations due RACC by Debtor under this Promissory Note, and any renewals,
extensions or changes hereof, including all such Obligations that would become
due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to section 362(a) of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code and the operation of sections 502(b) and 506(b) of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code and including, without limitation, post-petition
interest (collectively, the "Obligations"), shall be secured by the Corporate
Security Documents, the Group B Security Documents and any other collateral
security now or hereafter granted to RACC by the Debtor.

         10.  Purpose of Loan; Usury. Debtor warrants and represents to RACC
that this loan is for business and commercial purposes and not for personal,
family, household or agricultural purposes. It is agreed, notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in any of the Transaction Documents, in no event will
this Promissory

<PAGE>

Note require the payment of interest or charges in excess of the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate") and the payment of obligations
of Debtor under this Promissory Note are hereby limited accordingly. If under
any circumstances, whether by reason of advancement or acceleration of the
maturity of the unpaid principal balance hereof or otherwise, the aggregate
amounts paid on this Promissory Note shall include amounts which by law are
deemed interest and would exceed the Maximum Rate, Debtor stipulates that
payment and collection of such excess amounts shall have been and will be deemed
to have been the result of a mistake on the part of both Debtor and RACC, and
RACC shall promptly credit such excess (to the extent only of such payments in
excess of the Maximum Rate) against the unpaid principal balance hereof and any
portion of such excess payments not capable of being so credited shall be
refunded to Debtor.

         11.  Waiver. The Debtor hereby waives presentment, demand for payment,
notice of non-payment, notice of dishonor, and all other notices or demands in
connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default or endorsement of
this Promissory Note, protest and impairment of collateral, as well as diligence
in collecting this Promissory Note or enforcing any of the security therefor,
and consents to all extensions, deferrals, partial payments and refinancings
hereof before or after maturity.

         12.  Events of Default; Acceleration. If any of the following events
(each an "Event of Default") shall occur:

              (a)   Debtor shall fail to pay any principal of interest on this
         Promissory Note or any other sum due under this Promissory Note, any
         Transaction Document, or any other note or other agreement between
         Debtor and RACC when the same becomes due and such failure shall
         continue for ten (10) days beyond the due date of such payment;

              (b)   Debtor shall fail to perform any term, covenant or agreement
         contained in any of the Transaction Documents and such failure shall
         continue for thirty (30) days after written notice;

              (c)   any representation or warranty of Debtor in any of the
         Transaction Documents or in any certificate or notice given in
         connection therewith shall have been false or misleading in any
         material respect at the time made or deemed to have been made;

              (d)   Debtor shall be in default under any agreement or agreements
         evidencing (i) any other debt and similar monetary obligations
         (including, without limitation, capitalized leases, synthetic leases or
         securitization transactions) (collectively, "Indebtedness") owing to
         RACC or any of its affiliates, or (ii) any other Indebtedness in excess
         of $100,000.00 in aggregate

<PAGE>

         principal amount, or shall fail to pay any such Indebtedness when due
         or within any applicable period of grace;

              (e)   any of the Transaction Documents shall cease to be in full
         force and effect;

              (f)   Debtor (i) shall make an assignment for the benefit of
         creditors; (ii) shall be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent; (iii) shall
         seek the appointment of, or be the subject of an order appointing, a
         trustee, liquidator or receiver as to all or part of its assets, (iv)
         shall commence, approve or consent to, any case or proceeding under any
         bankruptcy, reorganization or similar law and, in the case of an
         involuntary case or proceeding, such case or proceeding is not
         dismissed within forty-five (45) days following the commencement
         thereof, or (v) shall be the subject of an order for relief in an
         involuntary case under federal bankruptcy law;

              (g)   Debtor shall be unable to pay its debts as they mature;

              (h)   there shall remain undischarged for more than thirty (30)
         days any final judgment or execution action against Debtor that,
         together with other outstanding claims and execution actions against
         Debtor, respectively, exceeds $100,000.00 in the aggregate;

              (i)   the prospect of payment or performance by Debtor or
         realization on the Collateral, in the reasonable opinion of RACC, is or
         becomes significantly impaired;

              (j)   any of the Aircraft shall have been lost, stolen or
         confiscated or shall have incurred substantial damage or have been
         destroyed to such an extent that the repair thereof is impracticable
         (as determined solely by RACC); or

              (k)   Debtor (i) sells, transfers or disposes of all or
         substantially all of its respective stock, assets or property, (ii)
         becomes the subject of, or engages in, a leveraged buy-out, or (iii)
         terminates its existence by merger, reorganization or consolidation.

              THEN, or at any time thereafter:

              (1)   In the case of any Event of Default under clauses (f) or
         (g), the entire unpaid principal amount of this Promissory Note and all
         other amounts payable hereunder, shall automatically become forthwith
         due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any
         kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Debtor; and

<PAGE>

              (2)   In the case of any Event of Default other than under clauses
         (f) or (g), RACC may, by written notice to Debtor, declare the unpaid
         principal amount of this Promissory Note and all other amounts payable
         hereunder, to be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,
         demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
         expressly waived by Debtor.

         In addition to and without in any way limiting the foregoing, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter, RACC may employ all
remedies allowed by law, including, without limitation, those available to a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code. No remedy herein conferred upon
RACC is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy
shall be cumulative and in addition to every other remedy hereunder, now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.

         13.  Obligations Absolute. Debtor's payment and performance obligations
under this Promissory Note and the other Transaction Documents are absolute and
unconditional. Any claim that Debtor may now or hereafter have against RACC or
any affiliate thereof arising out of or in connection with the Aircraft, any of
the other Collateral or any other matter shall not affect or excuse the
unconditional obligation of Debtor to make any payment required to be made to
RACC under the Transaction Documents, and shall not be used or asserted as a
defense to payment of such obligation or as set-off, counterclaim or deduction
against such payment. RACC shall have no obligation or responsibility with
respect to any dispute that may arise between Debtor and any such foregoing
person, and no such dispute shall prevent RACC from taking such action as it may
deem appropriate in order to preserve, protect or enforce its rights hereunder.

         14.  Debtor's Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, Etc. Debtor further
agrees to pay to RACC, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs
and legal expenses) incurred or expended by RACC in connection with the
Obligations, this Promissory Note and the enforcement hereof, together with
interest on amounts recoverable under this Section 14 from the time when such
amounts become due until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the
Default Interest Rate, provided that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount
permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced
to such maximum permitted amount.

         15.  Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be
effective unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of
the same default in the future.

<PAGE>

         16.  Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any
change of address from that shown herein within ten (10) days of such change.

         17.  GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS PROMISSORY NOTE WAS MADE
AND ENTERED INTO IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS TRANSACTION
SHALL BE THAT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXIST. THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
PROMISSORY NOTE SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN EITHER THE UNITED STATES
DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS AT WICHITA, KANSAS, OR IN THE

OF ALL OTHER COURTS AND TRIBUNALS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IN THE EVENT AN
EVENT OF DEFAULT SHOULD OCCUR, RACC (AT ITS SOLE OPTION) MAY INSTITUTE LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS IN ANY JURISDICTION AS MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN ORDER FOR RACC TO
OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL OR OTHERWISE REALIZE UPON ITS SECURITY. THE
PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT AND AGREE TO BE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE
AFORESAID COURTS IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS.

         18.  WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL. ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY VOLUNTARILY, KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR OTHER
RIGHT EACH MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION CONCERNING

RACC
SENIOR NOTE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      RAYTHEON AIRCRAFT CREDIT CORPORATION

                                   ----------

         1.   Restructuring Agreement. Reference is hereby made to that certain
Restructuring Agreement (as amended and in effect from time to time, the
"Restructuring Agreement"), dated as of December 31, 2002, by and between Great
Lakes Aviation, Ltd., an Iowa corporation (the "Debtor") and Raytheon Aircraft
Credit Corporation, a Kansas corporation ("RACC"). Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Restructuring Agreement.

         2.   Promise to Pay. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned hereby
absolutely and unconditionally promises to pay to the order of RACC, at 10511
East Central, Wichita, Kansas 67206 (together with its successor and assigns
hereinafter referred to as "RACC"), in lawful money of the United States of
America and in immediately available funds, the principal sum of FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS ($5,000,000.00) (as such amount may be increased pursuant to Section 3
below, the "Principal Sum"). All payments made pursuant to this promissory note
(this "Promissory Note") will be made free and clear of, and without deduction
for, withholding, setoff, recoupment or counterclaim of any kind.

         3.   Interest Rate. In addition to Debtor's payment of the Principal
Sum, Debtor shall pay interest to RACC on the outstanding Principal Sum at the
rate of eight and one quarter percent (8.25%) per annum. The annual rate of
interest applicable hereunder from time to time, as specified above, is referred
to herein as the "Interest Rate." All interest shall be calculated on the basis
of a 360-day year and actual days outstanding. Interest shall accrue on the
outstanding Principal Sum under this Promissory Note and shall be capitalized
and added to the Principal Sum on the last day of each calendar quarter
commencing on March 31, 2003. Commencing on March 31, 2005, interest on this
Promissory Note shall be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on the final day
of each calendar quarter. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Promissory
Note to the contrary, in no event shall the rate of interest payable pursuant to
this Section 3 be higher than the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

<PAGE>

         4.   Late Payment Charge. While an Event of Default (as defined below)
is continuing, Debtor agrees to pay to RACC interest on the unpaid principal
balance hereunder or other amounts payable hereunder (compounded monthly and
payable on demand in respect of overdue amounts) at a rate per annum which is
equal to LIBOR plus six hundred basis points (the "Default Interest Rate") until
such Event of Default has been cured or waived in writing by RACC (after as well
as before judgment). "LIBOR" shall mean the rate of interest determined by RACC
at which Dollar deposits for ninety (90) days are offered based on information
provided in The Wall Street Journal on the second business day prior to the date
of the issuance of this Promissory Note or the first day of January, April, July
and October, as applicable, provided, however, that if the rate described above
does not appear in The Wall Street Journal on any applicable interest
determination date, LIBOR shall be the rate determined by RACC in good faith
based on the offered rates for deposits in Dollars for ninety (90) days that are
then offered by major banks in the London interbank market. LIBOR shall be
adjusted on the first business day of each calendar quarter to reflect any
increase or decrease in LIBOR as of that date.

         5.   Repayment. The outstanding Principal Sum of this Promissory Note
on March 31, 2005 shall be paid by the Debtor to RACC in equal quarterly
payments on the last day of each calendar quarter commencing on March 31, 2005.
All amounts of principal and interest not repaid by Debtor prior to December 31,
2009 (the "Due Date") shall be paid in full on the Due Date.

         6.   Taxes. All payments (whether of principal, interest or otherwise)
made by Debtor to RACC pursuant to this Promissory Note will be free and clear
of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, duties, charges, fees or
withholdings of any nature, provided, however, that taxes based on the net
income of RACC are specifically excluded from the provisions of this Section 6.
If Debtor is required by law to make any such deduction or withholding, the sum
due from Debtor will be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that RACC
receives a sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or
withholding been required. Within thirty (30) days after Debtor has made any
payment from which it is required by law to make any deduction or withholding,
Debtor will deliver to RACC a receipt issued by the applicable tax or other
authority evidencing the deduction or withholding.

         7.   Prepayment. This Promissory Note shall be subject to mandatory
prepayment from Excess Cash Flow as provided in Section 11(A) of the
Restructuring Agreement. In addition, Debtor may prepay this obligation in part
or in full at any time without any premium or penalty. Any partial prepayment
shall be applied to the installments of principal in inverse order of maturity
and in accordance with Section 11(C) of the Restructuring Agreement.

<PAGE>

         8.   Covenants. Debtor covenants and agrees that, until the payment and
satisfaction in full of all the obligations of and amounts owed by Debtor under
this Promissory Note, Debtor will:

              (a)   furnish RACC with such financial information with respect to
         Debtor or the collateral described in the Security Agreements and in
         Section 13 of the Restructuring Agreement (the "Collateral") as RACC
         may reasonably request;

              (b)   keep true and accurate books of account with respect to the
         Collateral and to permit RACC or its designated representatives to
         inspect the Collateral and the Aircraft and to examine and be advised
         as to such records upon the request of RACC;

              (c)   comply with any law, treaty, rule, regulation or
         determination of an arbitrator, court, or other governmental authority,
         in each case applicable to or binding upon Debtor or affecting any of
         its property;

              (d)   notify RACC promptly in writing of (i) the occurrence of any
         Default or Event of Default, (ii) any change of name or address of
         Debtor, (iii) any threatened or pending litigation or similar
         proceeding affecting Debtor or any material change in any such
         litigation or proceeding previously reported and (iv) any claims of any
         nature against the Collateral or the Aircraft; and

              (e)   cooperate with RACC, take such action, execute such
         documents, and provide such information as RACC may from time to time
         request in order further to effect the transactions contemplated by and
         the purposes of this Promissory Note and the other Transaction
         Documents.

         9.   Security Agreement. The payment and performance of all of the
Obligations due RACC by Debtor under this Promissory Note, and any renewals,
extensions or changes hereof, including all such Obligations that would become
due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to section 362(a) of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code and the operation of sections 502(b) and 506(b) of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code and including, without limitation, post-petition
interest (collectively, the "Obligations"), shall be secured by the Corporate
Security Documents, the Group B Security Documents and any other collateral
security now or hereafter granted to RACC by the Debtor.

         10.  Purpose of Loan; Usury. Debtor warrants and represents to RACC
that this loan is for business and commercial purposes and not for personal,
family, household or agricultural purposes. It is agreed, notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in any of the Transaction Documents, in no event will
this Promissory

<PAGE>

Note require the payment of interest or charges in excess of the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate") and the payment of obligations
of Debtor under this Promissory Note are hereby limited accordingly. If under
any circumstances, whether by reason of advancement or acceleration of the
maturity of the unpaid principal balance hereof or otherwise, the aggregate
amounts paid on this Promissory Note shall include amounts which by law are
deemed interest and would exceed the Maximum Rate, Debtor stipulates that
payment and collection of such excess amounts shall have been and will be deemed
to have been the result of a mistake on the part of both Debtor and RACC, and
RACC shall promptly credit such excess (to the extent only of such payments in
excess of the Maximum Rate) against the unpaid principal balance hereof and any
portion of such excess payments not capable of being so credited shall be
refunded to Debtor.

         11.  Waiver. The Debtor hereby waives presentment, demand for payment,
notice of non-payment, notice of dishonor, and all other notices or demands in
connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default or endorsement of
this Promissory Note, protest and impairment of collateral, as well as diligence
in collecting this Promissory Note or enforcing any of the security therefor,
and consents to all extensions, deferrals, partial payments and refinancings
hereof before or after maturity.

         12.  Events of Default; Acceleration. If any of the following events
(each an "Event of Default") shall occur:

              (a)   Debtor shall fail to pay any principal of interest on this
         Promissory Note or any other sum due under this Promissory Note, any
         Transaction Document, or any other note or other agreement between
         Debtor and RACC when the same becomes due and such failure shall
         continue for ten (10) days beyond the due date of such payment;

              (b)   Debtor shall fail to perform any term, covenant or agreement
         contained in any of the Transaction Documents and such failure shall
         continue for thirty (30) days after written notice;

              (c)   any representation or warranty of Debtor in any of the
         Transaction Documents or in any certificate or notice given in
         connection therewith shall have been false or misleading in any
         material respect at the time made or deemed to have been made;

              (d)   Debtor shall be in default under any agreement or agreements
         evidencing (i) any other debt and similar monetary obligations
         (including, without limitation, capitalized leases, synthetic leases or
         securitization transactions) (collectively, "Indebtedness") owing to
         RACC or any of its affiliates, or (ii) any other Indebtedness in excess
         of $100,000.00 in aggregate

<PAGE>

         principal amount, or shall fail to pay any such Indebtedness when due
         or within any applicable period of grace;

              (e)   any of the Transaction Documents shall cease to be in full
         force and effect;

              (f)   Debtor (i) shall make an assignment for the benefit of
         creditors; (ii) shall be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent; (iii) shall
         seek the appointment of, or be the subject of an order appointing, a
         trustee, liquidator or receiver as to all or part of its assets, (iv)
         shall commence, approve or consent to, any case or proceeding under any
         bankruptcy, reorganization or similar law and, in the case of an
         involuntary case or proceeding, such case or proceeding is not
         dismissed within forty-five (45) days following the commencement
         thereof, or (v) shall be the subject of an order for relief in an
         involuntary case under federal bankruptcy law;

              (g)   Debtor shall be unable to pay its debts as they mature;

              (h)   there shall remain undischarged for more than thirty (30)
         days any final judgment or execution action against Debtor that,
         together with other outstanding claims and execution actions against
         Debtor, respectively, exceeds $100,000.00 in the aggregate;

              (i)   the prospect of payment or performance by Debtor or
         realization on the Collateral, in the reasonable opinion of RACC, is or
         becomes significantly impaired;

              (j)   any of the Aircraft shall have been lost, stolen or
         confiscated or shall have incurred substantial damage or have been
         destroyed to such an extent that the repair thereof is impracticable
         (as determined solely by RACC); or

              (k)   Debtor (i) sells, transfers or disposes of all or
         substantially all of its respective stock, assets or property, (ii)
         becomes the subject of, or engages in, a leveraged buy-out, or (iii)
         terminates its existence by merger, reorganization or consolidation.

              THEN, or at any time thereafter:

              (1)   In the case of any Event of Default under clauses (f) or
         (g), the entire unpaid principal amount of this Promissory Note and all
         other amounts payable hereunder, shall automatically become forthwith
         due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any
         kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Debtor; and

<PAGE>

              (2)   In the case of any Event of Default other than under clauses
         (f) or (g), RACC may, by written notice to Debtor, declare the unpaid
         principal amount of this Promissory Note and all other amounts payable
         hereunder, to be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,
         demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
         expressly waived by Debtor.

         In addition to and without in any way limiting the foregoing, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter, RACC may employ all
remedies allowed by law, including, without limitation, those available to a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code. No remedy herein conferred upon
RACC is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy
shall be cumulative and in addition to every other remedy hereunder, now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.

         13.  Obligations Absolute. Debtor's payment and performance obligations
under this Promissory Note and the other Transaction Documents are absolute and
unconditional. Any claim that Debtor may now or hereafter have against RACC or
any affiliate thereof arising out of or in connection with the Aircraft, any of
the other Collateral or any other matter shall not affect or excuse the
unconditional obligation of Debtor to make any payment required to be made to
RACC under the Transaction Documents, and shall not be used or asserted as a
defense to payment of such obligation or as set-off, counterclaim or deduction
against such payment. RACC shall have no obligation or responsibility with
respect to any dispute that may arise between Debtor and any such foregoing
person, and no such dispute shall prevent RACC from taking such action as it may
deem appropriate in order to preserve, protect or enforce its rights hereunder.

         14.  Debtor's Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, Etc. Debtor further
agrees to pay to RACC, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs
and legal expenses) incurred or expended by RACC in connection with the
Obligations, this Promissory Note and the enforcement hereof, together with
interest on amounts recoverable under this Section 14 from the time when such
amounts become due until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the
Default Interest Rate, provided that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount
permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced
to such maximum permitted amount.

         15.  Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be
effective unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of
the same default in the future.

<PAGE>

         16.  Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any
change of address from that shown herein within ten (10) days of such change.

         17.  GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS PROMISSORY NOTE WAS MADE
AND ENTERED INTO IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS TRANSACTION
SHALL BE THAT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXIST. THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
PROMISSORY NOTE SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN EITHER THE UNITED STATES
DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS AT WICHITA, KANSAS, OR IN THE

EVENT OF DEFAULT SHOULD OCCUR, RACC (AT ITS SOLE OPTION) MAY INSTITUTE LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS IN ANY JURISDICTION AS MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN ORDER FOR RACC TO
OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL OR OTHERWISE REALIZE UPON ITS SECURITY. THE
PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT AND AGREE TO BE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE
AFORESAID COURTS IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS.

         18.  WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL. ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY VOLUNTARILY, KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR OTHER
RIGHT EACH MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION CONCERNING
THIS PROMISSORY NOTE.

         19.  Damages. To the extent that any party hereto is subject to
liability for any breach under this Promissory Note, the liability of such party
shall be limited to the actual and direct monetary damages caused by such
breach. In no event shall any party hereto be liable for indirect, special,
consequential, multiple or punitive damages, or any damage deemed to be of an
indirect or consequential nature arising out of or related to its performance
hereunder, whether based upon breach of contract, warranty, negligence and
whether grounded in tort, contract, civil law or other theories of liability,
including strict liability. To the extent that this limitation of liability
conflicts with any other provision(s) in this Promissory Note, said provision(s)
shall be regarded as amended to whatever extent required to make such
provision(s) consistent with this Section 19.

         20.  Enforceability. The unenforceability of any provision hereof shall
not affect the validity of any other provision hereof.

<PAGE>

         21.  Binding Agreement. All obligations of Debtor hereunder shall bind

                      RAYTHEON AIRCRAFT CREDIT CORPORATION
                             AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002

                                   ----------

        1.      Restructuring Agreement. Reference is hereby made to that
certain Restructuring Agreement (as amended and in effect from time to time, the
"Restructuring Agreement"), dated as of December 31, 2002, by and between Great
Lakes Aviation, Ltd., an Iowa corporation (the "Debtor"), and Raytheon Aircraft
Credit Corporation, a Kansas corporation ("RACC"). Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Restructuring Agreement.

        2.      Promise to Pay. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned hereby
absolutely and unconditionally promises to pay to the order of RACC, at 10511
East Central, Wichita, Kansas 67206 (together with its successor and assigns
hereinafter referred to as "RACC"), in lawful money of the United States of
America and in immediately available funds, the principal sum of FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS ($5,000,000.00) (as such amount may be increased pursuant to Section 3
below, the "Principal Sum"). All payments made pursuant to this discount
subordinated note (this "Subordinated Note") will be made free and clear of, and
without deduction for, withholding, setoff, recoupment or counterclaim of any
kind.

        3.      Interest Rate. In addition to Debtor's payment of the Principal
Sum, Debtor shall pay interest to RACC on the Principal Sum at the rate of six
percent (6%) per annum. For the first three years after the date of issuance of
the Subordinated Note, interest shall accrue on the outstanding Principal Sum
under the Subordinated Note and shall be capitalized and added to the Principal
Sum on the last day of each calendar quarter commencing on March 31, 2003.
Beginning on the third anniversary of the date of issue of this Subordinated
Note, interest shall be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on the last day of
each calendar quarter commencing on March 31, 2006. The annual rate of interest
applicable hereunder from time to time, as specified above, is referred to
herein as the "Interest Rate." All interest shall be calculated on the basis of
a 360-day year and actual days outstanding. Notwithstanding anything set forth
in this Subordinated Note to the contrary, in no event shall the rate of
interest payable pursuant to this Section 3 be higher than the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

<PAGE>

        4.      Late Payment Charge. While an Event of Default (as defined
below) is continuing, Debtor agrees to pay to RACC interest on the unpaid
principal balance hereunder or other amounts payable hereunder (compounded
monthly and payable on demand in respect of overdue amounts) at a rate per annum
which is equal to LIBOR plus six hundred basis points (the "Default Interest
Rate") until such Event of Default has been cured or waived in writing by RACC
(after as well as before judgment).

        5.      Repayment. In addition to payments of interest as provided in
Section 3, the Principal Sum plus all unpaid accrued interest shall be repaid in
full by the Debtor to RACC on or before September 30, 2007 (the "Due Date"). All
amounts of principal and interest not repaid by Debtor prior to September 30,
2007 shall be paid in full on the Due Date.

        6.      Prepayment. This Subordinate Note shall be subject to mandatory
prepayments from Excess Cash Flow as provided in Section 11(A) of the
Restructuring Agreement. Any partial prepayment shall be applied first to
payments of interest as provided in Section 3 and then to payment of the
Principal Sum.

        7.      Subordination. Except as otherwise provided in Section 11 of the
Restructuring Agreement, the indebtedness evidenced by this Subordinated Note is
subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Debtor's obligations
under the Group A Return Conditions Note and the Group B Notes (collectively,
the "Senior Obligations"). Until the date on which the Senior Obligations have
been repaid in full, RACC shall not demand, accelerate, sue for, take, receive
or accept from the Debtor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or
by set-off or any other manner (including, without limitation, from or by way of
collateral) any payment that is not expressly provided for in Section 11 of the
Restructuring Agreement or security of all or any of the indebtedness under this
Subordinated Note or exercise any remedies or take any action or proceeding to
enforce the same; provided, however, that, so long as no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing under the Restructuring Agreement,
nothing in this paragraph shall restrict the Debtor from paying, or RACC from
requesting, any payments under this Subordinated Note that are consistent with
the terms of Section 11 of the Restructuring Agreement. Should any payment,
distribution or security or proceeds thereof be received by RACC in violation of
the immediately preceding sentence, RACC agrees that such payment shall be
segregated, received and held in trust for the benefit of, and deemed to be the
property of, and shall be immediately be paid over and delivered to the holders
of the Senior Obligations. This paragraph shall constitute a continuing offer to
all persons who, in reliance upon such provisions, become holders of, or
continue to hold, the Senior Obligations and such holders are made obligees
hereunder and any one or more of them may enforce such provisions.

<PAGE>

        8.      Taxes. All payments (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise) made by Debtor to RACC pursuant to this Subordinated Note will be
free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, duties, charges,
fees or withholdings of any nature, provided, however, that taxes based on the
net income of RACC are specifically excluded from the provisions of this Section
8. If Debtor is required by law to make any such deduction or withholding, the
sum due from Debtor will be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that
RACC receives a sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction
or withholding been required. Within thirty (30) days after Debtor has made any
payment from which it is required by law to make any deduction or withholding,
Debtor will deliver to RACC a receipt issued by the applicable tax or other
authority evidencing the deduction or withholding.

        9.      Covenants. Debtor covenants and agrees that, until the payment
and satisfaction in full of all the obligations of and amounts owed by Debtor
under this Subordinated Note, Debtor will:

                (a)     furnish RACC with such financial information with
        respect to Debtor or the collateral described in the Security Agreements
        and in Section 13 of the Restructuring Agreement (the "Collateral") as
        RACC may reasonably request;

                (b)     keep true and accurate books of account with respect to
        the Collateral and to permit RACC or its designated representatives to
        inspect the Collateral and the Aircraft and to examine and be advised as
        to such records upon the request of RACC;

                (c)     comply with any law, treaty, rule, regulation or
        determination of an arbitrator, court, or other governmental authority,
        in each case applicable to or binding upon Debtor or affecting any of
        its property;

                (d)     notify RACC promptly in writing of (i) the occurrence of
        any Default or Event of Default, (ii) any change of name or address of
        Debtor, (iii) any threatened or pending litigation or similar proceeding
        affecting Debtor or any material change in any such litigation or
        proceeding previously reported and (iv) any claims of any nature against
        the Collateral or the Aircraft; and

                (e)     cooperate with RACC, take such action, execute such
        documents, and provide such information as RACC may from time to time
        request in order further to effect the transactions contemplated by and
        the purposes of this Subordinated Note and the other Transaction
        Documents.

<PAGE>

        10.     Security Agreement. The payment and performance of all of the
Obligations due RACC by Debtor under this Subordinated Note and any renewals,
extensions or changes hereof, including all such Obligations that would become
due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to section 362(a) of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code and the operation of sections 502(b) and 506(b) of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code and including, without limitation, post-petition
interest (collectively, the "Obligations"), shall be secured by the Corporate
Security Documents, the Group B Security Documents and any other collateral
security now or hereafter granted to RACC by the Debtor.

        11.     Purpose of Loan; Usury. Debtor warrants and represents to RACC
that this loan is for business and commercial purposes and not for personal,
family, household or agricultural purposes. It is agreed, notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in any of the Transaction Documents, in no event will
this Subordinated Note require the payment of interest or charges in excess of
the maximum amount permitted by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate") and the
payment of obligations of Debtor under this Subordinated Note are hereby limited
accordingly. If under any circumstances, whether by reason of advancement or
acceleration of the maturity of the unpaid principal balance hereof or
otherwise, the aggregate amounts paid on this Subordinated Note shall include
amounts which by law are deemed interest and would exceed the Maximum Rate,
Debtor stipulates that payment and collection of such excess amounts shall have
been and will be deemed to have been the result of a mistake on the part of both
Debtor and RACC, and RACC shall promptly credit such excess (to the extent only
of such payments in excess of the Maximum Rate) against the unpaid principal
balance hereof and any portion of such excess payments not capable of being so
credited shall be refunded to Debtor.

        12.     Waiver. The Debtor hereby waives presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-payment, notice of dishonor, and all other notices or
demands in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default or
endorsement of this Subordinated Note, protest and impairment of collateral, as
well as diligence in collecting this Subordinated Note or enforcing any of the
security therefor, and consents to all extensions, deferrals, partial payments
and refinancings hereof before or after maturity.

        13.     Events of Default; Acceleration. If any of the following events
(each an "Event of Default") shall occur:

                (a)     Debtor shall fail to pay any principal of interest on
        this Subordinated Note or any other sum due under this Subordinated
        Note, any Transaction Document, or any other note or other agreement
        between Debtor and RACC when the same becomes due and such failure shall
        continue for ten (10) days beyond the due date of such payment;

<PAGE>

                (b)     Debtor shall fail to perform any term, covenant or
        agreement contained in any of the Transaction Documents and such failure
        shall continue for thirty (30) days after written notice;

                (c)     any representation or warranty of Debtor in any of the
        Transaction Documents or in any certificate or notice given in
        connection therewith shall have been false or misleading in any material
        respect at the time made or deemed to have been made;

                (d)     Debtor shall be in default under any agreement or
        agreements evidencing (i) any other debt and similar monetary
        obligations (including, without limitation, capitalized leases,
        synthetic leases or securitization transactions) (collectively,
        "Indebtedness") owing to RACC or any of its affiliates or (ii) any other
        Indebtedness in excess of $100,000.00 in aggregate principal amount, or
        shall fail to pay any such Indebtedness when due or within any
        applicable period of grace;

                (e)     any of the Transaction Documents shall cease to be in
        full force and effect;

                (f)     Debtor (i) shall make an assignment for the benefit of
        creditors; (ii) shall be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent; (iii) shall
        seek the appointment of, or be the subject of an order appointing, a
        trustee, liquidator or receiver as to all or part of its assets, (iv)
        shall commence, approve or consent to, any case or proceeding under any
        bankruptcy, reorganization or similar law and, in the case of an
        involuntary case or proceeding, such case or proceeding is not dismissed
        within forty-five (45) days following the commencement thereof, or (v)
        shall be the subject of an order for relief in an involuntary case under
        federal bankruptcy law;

                (g)     Debtor shall be unable to pay its debts as they mature;

                (h)     there shall remain undischarged for more than thirty
        (30) days any final judgment or execution action against Debtor that,
        together with other outstanding claims and execution actions against
        Debtor, respectively, exceeds $100,000.00 in the aggregate;

                (i)     the prospect of payment or performance by Debtor or
        realization on the Collateral, in the reasonable opinion of RACC, is or
        becomes significantly impaired;

                (j)     any of the Aircraft shall have been lost, stolen or
        confiscated or shall have incurred substantial damage or have been
        destroyed to such an

<PAGE>

        extent that the repair thereof is impracticable (as determined solely by
        RACC); or

                (k)     Debtor (i) sells, transfers or disposes of all or
        substantially all of its respective stock, assets or property, (ii)
        becomes the subject of, or engages in, a leveraged buy-out, or (iii)
        terminates its existence by merger, reorganization or consolidation.

                THEN, or at any time thereafter:

                (1)     In the case of any Event of Default under clauses (f) or
        (g), the entire unpaid principal amount of this Subordinated Note and
        all other amounts payable hereunder, shall automatically become
        forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
        notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Debtor;
        and

                (2)     In the case of any Event of Default other than under
        clauses (f) or (g), RACC may, by written notice to Debtor, declare the
        unpaid principal amount of this Subordinated Note and all other amounts
        payable hereunder, to be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,
        demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
        expressly waived by Debtor.

        In addition to and without in any way limiting the foregoing, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter, RACC may employ all
remedies allowed by law, including, without limitation, those available to a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code. No remedy herein conferred upon
RACC is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy
shall be cumulative and in addition to every other remedy hereunder, now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.

        14.     Obligations Absolute. Debtor's payment and performance
obligations under this Subordinated Note and the other Transaction Documents are
absolute and unconditional. Any claim that Debtor may now or hereafter have
against RACC or any affiliate thereof arising out of or in connection with the
Aircraft, any of the other Collateral or any other matter shall not affect or
excuse the unconditional obligation of Debtor to make any payment required to be
made to RACC under the Transaction Documents, and shall not be used or asserted
as a defense to payment of such obligation or as set-off, counterclaim or
deduction against such payment. RACC shall have no obligation or responsibility
with respect to any dispute that may arise between Debtor and any such foregoing
person, and no such dispute shall prevent RACC from taking such action as it may
deem appropriate in order to preserve, protect or enforce its rights hereunder.

<PAGE>

        15.     Debtor's Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, Etc. Debtor further
agrees to pay to RACC, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs
and legal expenses) incurred or expended by RACC in connection with the
Obligations, this Subordinated Note and the enforcement hereof, together with
interest on amounts recoverable under this Section 15 from the time when such
amounts become due until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the
Default Interest Rate, provided that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount
permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced
to such maximum permitted amount.

        16.     Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be
effective unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of
the same default in the future.

        17.     Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any
change of address from that shown herein within ten (10) days of such change.

        18.     GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS SUBORDINATED NOTE WAS

TRANSACTION SHALL BE THAT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME
EXIST. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF

OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL OR OTHERWISE REALIZE UPON ITS SECURITY. THE
PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT AND AGREE TO BE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE

                               SECURITY AGREEMENT

        SECURITY AGREEMENT, dated as of December 31, 2002 (this "Agreement"),
between Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd., an Iowa corporation (the "Company"), and
Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation, a Kansas corporation (hereinafter,
"RACC").

        WHEREAS, the Company has entered into a Restructuring Agreement dated as
of the date hereof (as amended and in effect from time to time, the
"Restructuring Agreement") with RACC, pursuant to which RACC, subject to the
terms and conditions contained therein, has agreed to accept the return of
certain aircraft and provide certain related financing, to restructure its
financing of certain existing aircraft and reduce lease payments on certain
aircraft; and

        WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to RACC's restructuring any loan or
otherwise extending credit to the Company under the Restructuring Agreement that
the Company execute and deliver to RACC a security agreement in substantially
the form hereof; and

        WHEREAS, the Company wishes to grant a security interest in favor of
RACC as herein provided;

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises contained herein and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

        1.      Definitions. All capitalized terms used herein without
definitions shall have the respective meanings provided therefor in the
Restructuring Agreement. The term "State", as used herein, means the State of
Kansas. All terms defined in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State and used
herein shall have the same definitions herein as specified therein. However, if
a term is defined in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State
differently than in another Article of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State,
the term has the meaning specified in Article 9.

        2.      Grant of Security Interest. The Company hereby grants to RACC,
to secure the payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations, a
security interest in and pledges and assigns to RACC the following properties,
assets and rights of the Company, wherever located, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired or arising, and all proceeds and products thereof (all of the
same being hereinafter called the "Collateral"): all personal and fixture
property of every kind and nature including without limitation all goods
(including inventory, equipment and any accessions thereto), instruments
(including promissory notes), documents, accounts (including
health-care-insurance receivables), chattel paper (whether tangible or
electronic), deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights (whether or not the
letter of

<PAGE>

                                       -2-

credit is evidenced by a writing), commercial tort claims, securities and all
other investment property, supporting obligations, any other contract rights or
rights to the payment of money, insurance claims and proceeds, and all general
intangibles (including all payment intangibles). RACC acknowledges that the
attachment of its security interest in any commercial tort claim as original
collateral is subject to the Company's compliance with Section 4.7.

        3.      Authorization to File Financing Statements. The Company hereby
irrevocably authorizes RACC at any time and from time to time to file in any
filing office in any Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction any initial financing
statements and amendments thereto that (a) indicate the Collateral (i) as all
assets of the Company or words of similar effect, regardless of whether any
particular asset comprised in the Collateral falls within the scope of Article 9
of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State or such jurisdiction, or (ii) as
being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail, and (b) provide any
other information required by part 5 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code
of the State or such other jurisdiction for the sufficiency or filing office
acceptance of any financing statement or amendment, including (i) whether the
Company is an organization, the type of organization and any organizational
identification number issued to the Company and, (ii) in the case of a financing
statement filed as a fixture filing or indicating Collateral as as-extracted
collateral or timber to be cut, a sufficient description of real property to
which the Collateral relates. The Company agrees to furnish any such information
to RACC promptly upon RACC's request. The Company also ratifies its
authorization for RACC to have filed in any Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction
any like initial financing statements or amendments thereto if filed prior to
the date hereof.

        4.      Other Actions. Further to insure the attachment, perfection and
first priority of, and the ability of RACC to enforce, RACC's security interest
in the Collateral, the Company agrees, in each case at the Company's expense, to
take the following actions with respect to the following Collateral and without
limitation on the Company's other obligations contained in this Agreement:

                4.1.    Promissory Notes and Tangible Chattel Paper. If the
        Company shall, now or at any time hereafter, hold or acquire any
        promissory notes or tangible chattel paper, the Company shall forthwith
        endorse, assign and deliver the same to RACC, accompanied by such
        instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as RACC may
        from time to time specify.

                4.2.    Deposit Accounts. For each deposit account that the
        Company, now or at any time hereafter, opens or maintains, the Company
        shall, at RACC's request and option, pursuant to an agreement in form
        and substance satisfactory to RACC, either (a) cause the depositary bank
        to agree to comply, without further consent of the Company, at any time
        with instructions from RACC to such depositary bank directing the
        disposition of funds from time to

<PAGE>

                                       -3-

        time credited to such deposit account, or (b) arrange for RACC to become
        the customer of the depositary bank with respect to the deposit account,
        with the Company being permitted, only with the consent of RACC, to
        exercise rights to withdraw funds from such deposit account. RACC agrees
        with the Company that RACC shall not give any such instructions or
        withhold any withdrawal rights from the Company, unless an Event of
        Default has occurred and is continuing, or, if effect were given to any
        withdrawal not otherwise permitted by the Transaction Documents, would
        occur. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to (i) any
        deposit account for which the Company, the depositary bank and RACC have
        entered into a cash collateral agreement specially negotiated among the
        Company, the depositary bank and RACC for the specific purpose set forth
        therein and (ii) any deposit accounts specially and exclusively used for
        payroll, payroll taxes and other employee wage and benefit payments to
        or for the benefit of the Company's employees.

                4.3.    Investment Property. If the Company shall, now or at any
        time hereafter, hold or acquire any certificated securities, the Company
        shall forthwith endorse, assign and deliver the same to RACC,
        accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed
        in blank as RACC may from time to time specify. If any securities now or
        hereafter acquired by the Company are uncertificated and are issued to
        the Company or its nominee directly by the issuer thereof, the Company
        shall immediately notify RACC thereof and, at RACC's request and option,
        pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to RACC,
        either (a) cause the issuer to agree to comply, without further consent
        of the Company or such nominee, at any time with instructions from RACC
        as to such securities, or (b) arrange for RACC to become the registered
        owner of the securities. If any securities, whether certificated or
        uncertificated, or other investment property now or hereafter acquired
        by the Company are held by the Company or its nominee through a
        securities intermediary or commodity intermediary, the Company shall
        immediately notify RACC thereof and, at RACC's request and option,
        pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to RACC,
        either (i) cause such securities intermediary or (as the case may be)
        commodity intermediary to agree to comply, in each case without further
        consent of the Company or such nominee, at any time, with entitlement
        orders or other instructions from RACC to such securities intermediary
        as to such securities or other investment property, or (as the case may
        be) to apply any value distributed on account of any commodity contract
        as directed by RACC to such commodity intermediary, or (ii) in the case
        of financial assets or other investment property held through a
        securities intermediary, arrange for RACC to become the entitlement
        holder with respect to such investment property, with the Company being
        permitted, only with the consent of RACC, to exercise rights to withdraw
        or otherwise deal with such investment property. RACC agrees with the
        Company that RACC shall not give any

<PAGE>

                                       -4-

        such entitlement orders or instructions or directions to any such
        issuer, securities intermediary or commodity intermediary, and shall not
        withhold its consent to the exercise of any withdrawal or dealing rights
        by the Company, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
        continuing, or, after giving effect to any such investment and
        withdrawal rights not otherwise permitted by the Transaction Documents,
        would occur. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any
        financial assets credited to a securities account for which RACC is the
        securities intermediary.

                4.4.    Collateral in the Possession of a Bailee. If any
        Collateral is, now or at any time hereafter, in the possession of a
        bailee, the Company shall promptly notify RACC thereof and, at RACC's
        request and option, shall promptly obtain an acknowledgement from the
        bailee, in form and substance satisfactory to RACC, that the bailee
        holds such Collateral for the benefit of RACC and such bailee's
        agreement to comply without further consent of the Company, at any time
        with instructions of RACC as to such Collateral. RACC agrees with the
        Company that RACC shall not give any such instructions unless an Event
        of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur after taking
        into account any action by the Company with respect to the bailee.

                4.5.    Electronic Chattel Paper and Transferable Records. If
        the Company, now or at any time hereafter, holds or acquires an interest
        in any electronic chattel paper or any "transferable record," as that
        term is defined in Section 201 of the federal Electronic Signatures in
        Global and National Commerce Act, or in Section 16 of the Uniform
        Electronic Transactions Act as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction,
        the Company shall promptly notify RACC thereof and, at the request and
        option of RACC, shall take such action as RACC may reasonably request to
        vest in RACC control, under Section 9-105 of the Uniform Commercial
        Code, of such electronic chattel paper or control under Section 201 of
        the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act

        Transactions Act, as so in effect in such jurisdiction, of such
        transferable record. RACC agrees with the Company that RACC will
        arrange, pursuant to procedures satisfactory to RACC and so long as such
        procedures will not result in RACC's loss of control, for the Company to
        make alterations to the electronic chattel paper or transferable record
        permitted under UCC Section 9-105 or, as the case may be, Section 201 of
        the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or
        Section 16 of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act for a party in
        control to make without loss of control, unless an Event of Default has
        occurred and is continuing or would occur after taking into account any
        action by the Company with respect to such electronic chattel paper or
        transferable record.

        request and option of RACC, the Company shall, pursuant to an agreement
        in form and substance satisfactory to RACC, either (a) arrange for the

        any time hereafter, hold or acquire a commercial tort claim, the Company
        shall immediately notify RACC in a writing signed by the Company of the

        interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this
        Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance satisfactory to
        RACC.

                4.8.    Other Actions as to any and all Collateral. The Company
        further agrees, upon request of RACC and at RACC's option, to take any
        and all other actions as RACC may determine to be necessary or useful

        and, where appropriate, filing financing statements and amendments
        relating thereto under the Uniform Commercial Code, to the extent, if

        causing RACC's name to be noted as secured party on any certificate of
        title for a titled good if such notation is a condition to attachment,

        security interest in such Collateral, (c) complying with any provision
        of any statute, regulation or treaty of the United States as to any

        8.      Insurance.

                8.1.    Maintenance of Insurance. In addition to any other
        insurance required to be maintained in connection with the other
        Transaction Documents, the Company will maintain with financially sound
        and reputable insurers insurance with respect to its properties and
        business against such casualties and contingencies as shall be in
        accordance with general practices of businesses engaged in similar
        activities in similar geographic areas. Such insurance shall be in such
        minimum amounts that the Company will not be deemed a co-insurer under
        applicable insurance laws, regulations and policies and otherwise shall
        be in such amounts, contain such terms, be in

<PAGE>

                                      -10-

        such forms and be for such periods as may be reasonably satisfactory to
        RACC. In addition, all such insurance shall be payable to RACC as loss
        payee under a "standard" loss payee clause. Without limiting the
        foregoing, the Company will (a) keep all of its physical property
        insured with casualty or physical hazard insurance on an "all risks"
        basis, with a full replacement cost endorsement and an "agreed amount"
        clause in an amount equal to 100% of the full replacement cost of such
        property, (b) maintain all such workers' compensation or similar
        insurance as may be required by law and (c) maintain, in amounts and
        with deductibles equal to those generally maintained by businesses
        engaged in similar activities in similar geographic areas, general
        public liability insurance against claims of bodily injury, death or
        property damage occurring, on, in or about the properties of the
        Company; business interruption insurance; and product liability
        insurance.

                8.2.    Insurance Proceeds. Except as otherwise specifically
        provided in any of the other Transaction Documents, the proceeds of any
        casualty insurance in respect of any casualty loss of any of the
        Collateral shall, subject to the rights, if any, of other parties with
        an interest having priority in the property covered thereby, (a) so long
        as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and to
        the extent that the amount of such proceeds is less than $50,000, be
        disbursed to the Company for direct application by the Company solely to
        the repair or replacement of the Company's property so damaged or
        destroyed and (b) in all other circumstances, be held by RACC as cash
        collateral for the Obligations. RACC may, at its sole option, disburse
        from time to time all or any part of such proceeds so held as cash
        collateral, upon such terms and conditions as RACC may reasonably
        prescribe, for direct application by the Company solely to the repair or
        replacement of the Company's property so damaged or destroyed, or RACC
        may apply all or any part of such proceeds to the Obligations.

                8.3.    Continuation of Insurance. Except as otherwise
        specifically provided in any of the other Transaction Documents, all
        policies of insurance shall provide for at least thirty (30) days prior
        written cancellation notice to RACC. In the event of failure by the
        Company to provide and maintain insurance as herein provided, RACC may,
        at its option, provide such insurance and charge the amount thereof to
        the Company. The Company shall furnish RACC with certificates of
        insurance and policies evidencing compliance with the foregoing
        insurance provision.

        9.      Collateral Protection Expenses; Preservation of Collateral.

                9.1.    Expenses Incurred by Lender. In RACC's discretion, if
        the Company fails to do so, RACC may discharge taxes and other
        encumbrances at any time levied or placed on any of the Collateral, make
        repairs thereto and pay any necessary filing fees or insurance premiums.
        The Company

<PAGE>

                                      -11-

        agrees to reimburse RACC on demand for all expenditures so made. RACC
        shall have no obligation to the Company to make any such expenditures,
        nor shall the making thereof be construed as a waiver or cure of any
        Default or Event of Default.

                9.2.    Lender's Obligations and Duties. Anything herein to the
        contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall remain obligated and liable
        under each contract or agreement comprised in the Collateral to be
        observed or performed by the Company thereunder. RACC shall not have any
        obligation or liability under any such contract or agreement by reason
        of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by RACC of any
        payment relating to any of the Collateral, nor shall RACC be obligated
        in any manner to perform any of the obligations of the Company under or
        pursuant to any such contract or agreement, to make inquiry as to the
        nature or sufficiency of any payment received by RACC in respect of the
        Collateral or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party
        under any such contract or agreement, to present or file any claim, to
        take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of
        any amounts which may have been assigned to RACC or to which RACC may be
        entitled at any time or times. RACC's sole duty with respect to the
        custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its
        possession, under Section 9-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the
        State or otherwise, shall be to deal with such Collateral in the same
        manner as RACC deals with similar property for its own account.

        10.     Securities and Deposits. RACC may at any time following and
during the continuance of Event of Default, at its option, transfer to itself or
any nominee any securities constituting Collateral, receive any income thereon
and hold such income as additional Collateral or apply it to the Obligations.
Whether or not any Obligations are due, RACC may following and during the
continuance of an Event of Default demand, sue for, collect, or make any
settlement or compromise which it deems desirable with respect to the
Collateral. Regardless of the adequacy of Collateral or any other security for
the Obligations, any deposits or other sums at any time credited by or due from
RACC to the Company may at any time be applied to or set off against any of the
Obligations.

        11.     Notification to Account Debtors and Other Persons Obligated on
Collateral. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Company shall, at the request and option of RACC, notify account debtors and
other persons obligated on any of the Collateral of the security interest of
RACC in any account, chattel paper, general intangible, instrument or other
Collateral and that payment thereof is to be made directly to RACC or to any
financial institution designated by RACC as RACC's agent therefor, and RACC may
itself, if Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, without
notice to or demand upon the Company, so notify account debtors and other
persons obligated on Collateral. After the making of such a request or the
giving of any such notification, the

<PAGE>

                                      -12-

Company shall hold any proceeds of collection of accounts, chattel paper,
general intangibles, instruments and other Collateral received by the Company as
trustee for RACC without commingling the same with other funds of the Company
and shall turn the same over to RACC in the identical form received, together
with any necessary endorsements or assignments. RACC shall apply the proceeds of
collection of accounts, chattel paper, general intangibles, instruments and
other Collateral received by RACC to the Obligations, such proceeds to be
immediately credited after final payment in cash or other immediately available
funds of the items giving rise to them.

        12.     Power of Attorney.

                12.1.   Appointment and Powers of Lender. The Company hereby
        irrevocably constitutes and appoints RACC and any officer or agent
        thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful
        attorneys-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place
        and stead of the Company or in RACC's own name, for the purpose of
        carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all
        appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments
        that may be necessary or useful to accomplish the purposes of this
        Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, hereby
        gives said attorneys the power and right, on behalf of the Company,
        without notice to or assent by the Company, to do the following:

                        (a)     upon the occurrence and during the continuance
                of an Event of Default, generally to sell, transfer, pledge,
                make any agreement with respect to or otherwise dispose of or
                deal with any of the Collateral in such manner as is consistent
                with the Uniform Commercial Code of the State and as fully and
                completely as though RACC were the absolute owner thereof for
                all purposes, and to do, at the Company's expense, at any time,
                or from time to time, all acts and things which RACC deems
                necessary or useful to protect, preserve or realize upon the
                Collateral and RACC's security interest therein, in order to
                effect the intent of this Agreement, all no less fully and
                effectively as the Company might do, including, without
                limitation, (i) the filing and prosecuting of registration and
                transfer applications with the appropriate federal, state or
                local agencies or authorities with respect to trademarks,
                copyrights and patentable inventions and processes, (ii) upon
                written notice to the Company, the exercise of voting rights
                with respect to voting securities, which rights may be
                exercised, if RACC so elects, with a view to causing the
                liquidation of assets of the issuer of any such securities and
                (iii) the execution, delivery and recording, in connection with
                any sale or other disposition of any Collateral, of the
                endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or
                transfer with respect to such Collateral; and

                                      -13-

                        (b)     to the extent that the Company's authorization
                given in Section 3 is not sufficient, to file such financing
                statements with respect hereto, with or without the Company's
                signature, or a photocopy of this Agreement in substitution for
                a financing statement, as RACC may deem appropriate and to
                execute in the Company's name such financing statements and
                amendments thereto and continuation statements which may require
                the Company's signature.

                12.2.   Ratification by Company. To the extent permitted by law,
        the Company hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or
        cause to be done by virtue hereof. This power of attorney is a power
        coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

                12.3.   No Duty on RACC. The powers conferred on RACC hereunder
        are solely to protect its interests in the Collateral and shall not
        impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. RACC shall be
        accountable only for the amounts that it actually receives as a result
        of the exercise of such powers, and neither it nor any of its officers,
        directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to the Company for
        any act or failure to act, except for RACC's own gross negligence or
        willful misconduct.

        13.     Rights and Remedies. RACC, without any notice or demand upon the
Company, may from time to time exercise in respect of the Collateral, in
addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein, or otherwise
available to and to the extent not in violation of applicable law, including the
Federal Aviation Act, and if required, subject to the approval of the DOT and/or
the FAA or their respective successors or nominee, all the rights and remedies
of a secured party on default under the UCC in effect in all relevant
jurisdictions at the time of an Event of Default, including, without limitation,
the right to take possession of the Collateral, and for that purpose, RACC may,
so far as the Company can give authority therefor, enter upon any premises on
which the Collateral may be situated and remove the same therefrom. RACC may in
its discretion require the Company to assemble all or any part of the Collateral
at such location or locations within the jurisdiction(s) of the Company's
principal office(s) or at such other locations as RACC may reasonably designate.
RACC may also in its sole discretion, without notice except as specified below,
sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or
private sale, at any exchange, broker's board or at any of the RACC's offices or
elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and at such price or
prices and upon such other terms as RACC may deem commercially reasonable. To
the extent not inconsistent with the Federal Aviation Act, the DOT and the FAA
requirements, RACC may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral at any
such sale and shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making
settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the
Collateral sold at such sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a
credit on account of the purchase price of any Collateral payable by such person
at such sale.

<PAGE>

                                      -14-

Each purchaser at any such sale shall acquire the property sold absolutely free
from any claim or right on the purchase of the Company, and the Company hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all right of redemption, stay or
appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under rule of
law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. Unless the Collateral is
perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily
sold on a recognized market, RACC shall give the Company at least five (5)
business days prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale of
Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or any other intended
disposition is to be made. The Company hereby acknowledges that five (5)
business days prior written notice of such sale or sales shall be reasonable
notice. RACC shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of
notice of sale having been given. RACC may adjourn public or private sale from
time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefore and such sale
may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so
adjourned. The Company hereby waives, to the full extent permitted by law, any
claims against the RACC arising by reason of the fact that the price at which
any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price
which might have been obtained at a public sale. In addition, the Company waives
any and all rights that it may have to a judicial hearing in advance of the
enforcement of any of RACC's rights and remedies hereunder, including, without
limitation, its right following an Event of Default to take immediate possession
of the Collateral and to exercise its rights and remedies with respect thereto.

        14.     Standards for Exercising Rights and Remedies. To the extent that
applicable law imposes duties on RACC to exercise remedies in a commercially
reasonable manner, the Company acknowledges and agrees that it is not
commercially unreasonable for RACC (a) to fail to incur expenses reasonably
deemed significant by RACC to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to
fail to complete raw material or work in process into finished goods or other
finished products for disposition, (b) to fail to obtain third party consents
for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by
other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents for the
collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (c) to
fail to exercise collection remedies against account debtors or other persons
obligated on Collateral or to fail to remove liens or encumbrances on or any
adverse claims against Collateral, (d) to exercise collection remedies against
account debtors and other persons obligated on Collateral directly or through
the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (e) to
advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general
circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (f) to
contact other persons, whether or not in the same business as the Company, for
expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of the Collateral, (g)
to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of
Collateral, whether or not the collateral is of a specialized nature, (h) to
dispose of Collateral by utilizing Internet sites that provide for the auction
of assets of the types included in

<PAGE>

                                      -15-

the Collateral or that have the reasonable capability of doing so, or that match
buyers and sellers of assets, (i) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than
retail markets, (j) to disclaim disposition warranties, (k) to purchase
insurance or credit enhancements to insure RACC against risks of loss,
collection or disposition of Collateral or to provide to RACC a guaranteed
return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (l) to the extent
deemed appropriate by RACC, to obtain the services of brokers, investment
bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist RACC in the collection or
disposition of any of the Collateral. The Company acknowledges that the purpose
of this Section 14 is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or
omissions by RACC would fulfill RACC's duties under the Uniform Commercial Code
of the State or any other relevant jurisdiction in RACC's exercise of remedies
against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by RACC shall not be
deemed to fail to fulfill such duties solely on account of not being indicated
in this Section 14. Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Section 14 shall be construed to grant any rights to the Company or to
impose any duties on RACC that would not have been granted or imposed by this
Agreement or by applicable law in the absence of this Section 14.

        15.     No Waiver by Lender, etc. RACC shall not be deemed to have
waived any of its rights and remedies in respect of the Obligations or the
Collateral unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed by RACC. No delay
or omission on the part of RACC in exercising any right or remedy shall operate
as a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy. A waiver on
any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right or
remedy on any future occasion. All rights and remedies of RACC with respect to
the Obligations or the Collateral, whether evidenced hereby or by any other
instrument or papers, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly,
alternatively, successively or concurrently at such time or at such times as
RACC deems expedient.

        16.     Suretyship Waivers by Company. The Company waives demand,
notice, protest, notice of acceptance of this Agreement, notice of loans made,
credit extended, Collateral received or delivered or other action taken in
reliance hereon and all other demands and notices of any description. With
respect to both the Obligations and the Collateral, the Company assents to any
extension or postponement of the time of payment or any other indulgence, to any
substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect any security interest
in any Collateral, to the addition or release of any party or person primarily
or secondarily liable, to the acceptance of partial payment thereon and the
settlement, compromising or adjusting of any thereof, all in such manner and at
such time or times as RACC may deem advisable. RACC shall have no duty as to the
collection or protection of the Collateral or any income therefrom, the
preservation of rights against prior parties, or the preservation of any rights
pertaining thereto beyond the safe custody thereof as set forth in Section 9.2.
The Company further waives any and all other suretyship defenses.

<PAGE>

                                      -16-

        17.     Marshalling. RACC shall not be required to marshal any present
or future collateral security (including but not limited to the Collateral) for,
or other assurances of payment of, the Obligations or any of them or to resort
to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular
order, and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and in respect of such
collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in
addition to all other rights and remedies, however existing or arising. To the
extent that it lawfully may, the Company hereby agrees that it will not invoke
any law relating to the marshalling of collateral which might cause delay in or
impede the enforcement of RACC's rights and remedies under this Agreement or
under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Obligations or
under which any of the Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the
Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the
extent that it lawfully may, the Company hereby irrevocably waives the benefits
of all such laws.

        18.     Proceeds of Dispositions; Expenses. The Company shall pay to
RACC on demand any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, incurred or paid by RACC in protecting, preserving or enforcing
RACC's rights and remedies under or in respect of any of the Obligations or any
of the Collateral. After deducting all of said expenses, the residue of any
proceeds of collection or sale or other disposition of Collateral shall, to the
extent actually received in cash, be applied to the payment of the Obligations
in such order or preference as RACC may determine, proper allowance and
provision being made for any Obligations not then due. Upon the final payment
and satisfaction in full of all of the Obligations and after making any payments
required by Sections 9-608(a)(1)(C) or 9-615(a)(3) of the Uniform Commercial
Code of the State, any excess shall be returned to the Company. In the absence
of final payment and satisfaction in full of all of the Obligations, the Company
shall remain liable for any deficiency.

        19.     Overdue Amounts. Until paid, all amounts due and payable by the
Company hereunder shall be a debt secured by the Collateral and shall bear,
whether before or after judgment, interest at the Default Interest Rate set
forth in the Restructuring Agreement.

        20.     Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. THIS AGREEMENT IS
INTENDED TO TAKE EFFECT AS A SEALED INSTRUMENT AND SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE. The Company agrees that any
action or claim arising out of any dispute in connection with this Agreement,
any rights or obligations hereunder or the performance or enforcement of such
rights or obligations may be brought in the courts of the State or any federal
court sitting therein and consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such
court and to service of process in any such suit being made upon the Company by
mail at the address specified in of the Restructuring Agreement. The Company
hereby waives any objection that it may now or

<PAGE>

                                      -17-

hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit
is brought in an inconvenient court.

        21.     Waiver of Jury Trial. THE COMPANY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY
TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE
PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY SUCH RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS. Except as
prohibited by law, the Company waives any right which it may have to claim or
recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special,
exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in
addition to, actual damages. The Company (a) certifies that neither RACC nor any
representative, agent or attorney of RACC has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that RACC would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
foregoing waivers or other waivers contained in this Agreement and (b)
acknowledges that, in entering into the Restructuring Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which RACC is a party, RACC is relying upon, among
other things, the waivers and certifications contained in this Section 21.

        22.     Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns permitted by the Restructuring Agreement; provided that the Company
may not transfer or assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of RACC.

        23.     Miscellaneous. The headings of each section of this Agreement
are for convenience only and shall not define or limit the provisions thereof.
If any term of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity of all other terms hereof shall in no way be
affected thereby, and this Agreement shall be construed and be enforceable as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term had not been included herein. The
Company acknowledges receipt of a copy of this Agreement. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original,
but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

thereto in the Security Agreement);

        WHEREAS, the Security Agreement encumbers various aircraft parts and
other collateral collectively described herein as the "Collateral";

        WHEREAS, as of this date, Debtor has entered into a Restructuring

        WHEREAS, the parties intend by this instrument to amend the Security

including, without limitation, post-petition interest, and including, without

shall remain at all times the owner of the Collateral free from any prior
security interest, lien or encumbrance. WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING THE
FOREGOING, CUSTOMER SHALL NOT SELL, TRANSFER, ASSIGN, SUBLEASE, CONVEY, PLEDGE,

claiming interest therein. Debtor further warrants that it is and shall remain
at all times a citizen of the United States as defined by 49 U.S.C. Section
40102.

3.   Debtor Will Execute and Deliver Documents. Debtor will, at RACC's request,
furnish RACC such information and execute and deliver to RACC such documents and
do all such acts and things as RACC may reasonably request as are necessary or

interest in the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly titled
and registered and the security interest perfected to RACC's reasonable
satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in
all public offices where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable.

4.   Operation, Maintenance and Repair. Debtor shall operate, maintain and
repair the Collateral and retain actual control and possession thereof in
accordance with the following provisions:

     4a.  Debtor shall have complete use of the Collateral until default, and

thereof, properly, carefully and in compliance with all applicable statutes,
ordinances, regulations, policies of insurance and manufacturer's recommendation

certificated and qualified pilots and shall maintain U.S. registry and shall be
based within the geographical boundaries of the United States.

     4c.  Debtor shall be responsible for and pay for all expenses of owning and
operating the Collateral, including but not limited to storage, fuel,
lubricants, service, inspections, overhauls, replacements, maintenance and
repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturer's operating and maintenance
manuals, and in compliance with operating and maintenance manuals approved by
the FAA, and with FAA rules and regulations. Debtor shall properly maintain all
records pertaining to the maintenance and operation of the Collateral.

     4d.  Debtor will use reasonable care to prevent the Aircraft from being
damaged or injured and will promptly (but in no event later than 60 days after
discovery) replace any part or component of the Aircraft that may be damaged,
worn out, lost, destroyed, confiscated or otherwise rendered unsatisfactory or
unavailable for use.

<PAGE>

5.   Insurance. Debtor shall, at all times and at its sole expense, obtain and
carry the types and amounts of insurance coverage specified below:

        (a)     "All Risk" type hull insurance on the Aircraft in the kind and
                form satisfactory to RACC, including Comprehensive Ground and
                Flight Coverage and Fire and Extended Risk Coverage, both
                In-Flight and Not In-Flight, in amounts not less than the
                replacement value of the Collateral or as otherwise agreed in
                writing by RACC. All policies of insurance carried in accordance
                with this paragraph (a) shall name RACC as a Loss Payee and
                provide that the insurance proceeds from any loss involving the
                Aircraft shall be paid as follows (1) any loss not exceeding
                U.S. $100,000.00 shall be payable to Debtors with notice to
                RACC; (2) any loss exceeding $100,000.00 shall be jointly
                payable to RACC and Debtor, and (3) any total loss of the
                Aircraft shall be payable solely to RACC up to the amount of the
                unpaid principal sum and accrued interest and other charges owed
                by Debtor under the Restructuring Agreement and the other
                Transaction Documents. The policies shall include coverage
                against the perils of strikes, riots, civil commotions or labor
                disturbances, and any act of vandalism outside of the United
                States. The policies shall also specify that (i) any losses
                shall be adjusted by the insurer with the Debtor, with notice
                thereof being provided to RACC and the Aircraft manufacturer,
                and (ii) RACC and the Aircraft manufacturer shall have the right
                to fully inspect the Aircraft prior to, during and after repair
                of any loss involving the Aircraft.

        (b)     Legal liability insurance, in the kind and form satisfactory to
                RACC, with limits no less than $50,000,000.00 of combined single
                limit per occurrence, for bodily injury and property damage
                (including passengers). All policies of insurance carried in
                accordance with this paragraph (b) shall name Debtor as the
                primary insured and RACC as an additional insured thereunder.

All policies maintained by Debtor in accordance with subsections (a) and (b)
above shall also comply with the following requirements:

        (1)     be issued by insurers of recognized responsibility which are
                satisfactory to RACC;

        (2)     provide that if such insurance is canceled for any reason
                whatsoever, or any substantial change is made in policy terms,
                conditions or coverage, or the policy is allowed to lapse for
                nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall
                not be effective as to RACC until thirty (30) days after RACC's
                receipt of written notice from Debtor's insurers of the
                cancellation, change or lapse in policy terms, conditions or
                coverage;

        (3)     provide that in respect of the interest of RACC in such
                policies, the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action
                or inaction of Debtor and shall insure RACC regardless of any
                breach or violation by Debtor of any warranty, declaration or
                condition contained in such policies;

        (4)     be primary without right of contribution from any other
                insurance which is carried by RACC with respect to its interest
                in the Aircraft;

        (5)     waive any right of subrogation of the insurer against RACC;
                provided, however, that the right of subrogation shall not be
                waived with respect to any acts or omissions on the part of RACC
                or the manufacturer of the Aircraft (or any of its subsidiaries)

<PAGE>

                related to products sold, handled, distributed, repaired,
                serviced or maintained by said parties;

        (6)     provide that the geographic limits, if any, contained in such
                policy shall include at a minimum all territories over which
                Debtor will operate the Aircraft; and

        (7)     provide that RACC shall have no obligation or liability for
                premiums, commissions, assessments or calls in connection with
                such insurance policies.

Debtors shall furnish to RACC evidence of the aforesaid insurance coverage in
certificate form. Evidence of renewal of each policy shall thereafter be
furnished to RACC in certificate form. Debtor covenants that it will not do any
act or voluntarily suffer or permit any act to be done whereby any insurance
required hereunder shall or may be suspended, impaired or defeated. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the Restructuring Agreement,
RACC may, at its option, apply insurance proceeds, in whole or in part, to (i)
repair or replace the Aircraft or any part thereof or (ii) satisfy any or all of
the Obligations. Any surplus proceeds are to be paid to Debtor.

6.   Power of Attorney. Debtor hereby appoints RACC and its assigns or their
designated agent as Debtor's attorney-in-fact, irrevocably, with full power of
substitution, to collect all payments with respect to the Collateral, to receive
all moneys (including, but not limited to, refunds or proceeds of insurance)
that may become due under any policy insuring the Collateral and all awards
payable in connection with the condemnation, requisition or seizure of the
Collateral, or any part thereof, to execute proofs of claim, to endorse drafts,
checks and other instruments for the payment of money payable to Debtor in
payment of such insurance moneys and to do all other acts, things, take any
actions (including the filing of financing statements or other documents,
including, without limitation, those documents referred to in Section 3 hereof)
or institute any proceedings that RACC may deem to be necessary or appropriate
at any time to protect and preserve the interest of RACC in the Collateral, or
in this Security Agreement or the Restructuring Agreement.

7.   Debtor's Possession. Until default, Debtor may have possession of the
Collateral and use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Security
Agreement. RACC may examine and inspect the Collateral, wherever located, at all
reasonable times. At its option, but without assuming any obligation to do so,
RACC may discharge taxes, liens or security interests, or other encumbrances
levied or asserted against the Collateral, may place and pay for insurance
thereon, may order and pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof,
and may pay any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under
the preceding sentence shall constitute Obligations, shall be secured by the
Collateral and shall be payable upon demand, together with interest at the
Default Interest Rate as defined in the Restructuring Agreement until the
Obligations are paid in full. Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and
any proceeds therefrom, separate and distinct from other property of the Debtor
and shall keep accurate and complete records of the Collateral and any such
proceeds.

8.   Indemnity. Debtor assumes liability for, and hereby agrees to indemnify,
protect, save, defend and keep harmless RACC, its agents, employees, officers,
directors, shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns (for
purposes of this Section 8, collectively "RACC"), on a net after-tax basis, from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims (including, without limitation, claims involving or alleging product
liability or strict or absolute liability in tort), actions, suits, demands,
costs, expenses and disbursements (including, without limitation, legal fees and
expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever ("Claims") which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against RACC, whether or not RACC shall also be
indemnified as to any such Claim by any other Person, in any way relating to or
arising hereunder, any other Transaction Document or any other documents
contemplated hereby or thereby, or the performance or enforcement of any of the
terms hereof or thereof, or in any way relating to or arising out of any

<PAGE>

Transaction Document or the performance or enforcement of any of the terms
hereof or thereof, or in any way relating to or arising out of the assertion or
enforcement of any manufacturer's, vendor's or dealer's warranties on the
Aircraft or any part thereof (including, without limitation, any warranty of
RAC), or in any way relating to or arising out of the manufacture, inspection,
construction, purchase, pooling, interchange, acceptance, rejection, ownership,
titling or re-titling, delivery, lease, sublease, possession, use, operation,
maintenance, management, condition, registration or re-registration, sale,
return, removal, repossession, storage or other disposition of the Aircraft or
part thereof or any accident in connection therewith (including, without
limitation, latent and other defects, whether or not discoverable, and any Claim
for patent, trademark or copyright infringement).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Debtor shall not be required to indemnify RACC
for (a) any Claim caused solely and directly by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the RACC or (b) any Claim in respect of the Aircraft arising from
acts or events which occur after any and all other obligations of any kind
whatsoever of Debtor hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents have
been fully paid and/or performed, as the case may be, unless any such Claims
were caused by Debtor (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
successor, assignee, agent or servant of Debtor) or resulted or arose, directly
or indirectly, from any acts, events or omissions of any kind whatsoever during
the term hereof.

The liability of Debtor to make indemnification payments shall, notwithstanding
any expiration or other termination (whether voluntary, as the result of an
Event of Default, or otherwise) hereof or any of the other Transaction
Documents, continue to exist until such indemnity payments are irrevocably made
in full by Debtor and received by RACC. If any Claim is made against Debtor or
RACC, the party receiving notice of such Claim shall promptly notify the other,
but the failure of the party receiving notice to so notify the other shall not
relieve Debtor of any obligation hereunder.

9.   Event of Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in
the Restructuring Agreement, (a) RACC shall have the right to exercise all
remedies allowed by law, including, without limitation, those available to a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code and (b) RACC may require Debtor
to assemble the Collateral and make it available to RACC at a place to be
designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both parties. The
requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification
to Debtor of the time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or
of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be
made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's
address, as shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale
or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable expenses of retaking, holding,
preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with
reasonable costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, the
balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the payment of
any or all other Obligations, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by
any subordinate security interest in the Collateral of which RACC has received
notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for any
deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law.
After the occurrence of an Event of Default, Debtor agrees that RACC may fly or
otherwise move the Aircraft for demonstration and other purposes reasonably
related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of the
Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RACC may at its option and in its
sole discretion keep idle, lease, or use or operate the Aircraft without any
liability whatsoever. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Debtor hereby
waives any rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise which may
require RACC to sell, lease or otherwise use the Aircraft in mitigation of
RACC's damages as set forth in this Section or otherwise provided herein or
which may otherwise limit or modify any of RACC's rights or remedies under this
Section or otherwise provided herein.

<PAGE>

10.  Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective
unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of the same
default in the future.

11.  Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior
written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Collateral,
or any interest therein, or offer to do so or permanently remove or attempt to
permanently remove the Collateral from the United States. Debtor will keep the
Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will
not permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied.

12.  Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes
and assessments upon the Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this
Security Agreement and the Obligations.

13.  Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any change of
address from that shown in this Security Agreement within ten (10) days of such
change.

14.  GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT WAS MADE AND
ENTERED INTO IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS TRANSACTION SHALL
BE THAT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXIST. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECURITY
AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN EITHER THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT
COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS AT WICHITA, KANSAS, OR IN THE EIGHTEENTH
JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF SEDGWICK COUNTY, KANSAS, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL
OTHER COURTS AND TRIBUNALS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IN THE EVENT AN "EVENT OF
DEFAULT" SHOULD OCCUR, RACC (AT ITS SOLE OPTION) MAY INSTITUTE A LEGAL
PROCEEDING IN ANY JURISDICTION AS MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN ORDER FOR RACC TO OBTAIN
POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT AND AGREE TO BE SUBJECT
TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS.

15.  WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL. ALL PARTIES TO THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT
HEREBY VOLUNTARILY, KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR OTHER
RIGHT EACH MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION CONCERNING
THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT.

16.  Damages. To the extent that any party hereto is subject to liability for
any breach under this Security Agreement, the liability of such party shall be
limited to the actual and direct monetary damages caused by such breach. In no
event shall any party hereto be liable for indirect, special, consequential,
multiple or punitive damages, or any damage deemed to be of an indirect or
consequential nature arising out of or related to its performance hereunder,
whether based upon breach of contract, warranty, negligence and whether grounded
in tort, contract, civil law or other theories of liability, including strict
liability. To the extent that this limitation of liability conflicts with any
other provision(s) in this Security Agreement, said provision(s) shall be
regarded as amended to whatever extent required to make such provision(s)
consistent with this Section 16.

17.  Enforceability. The unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not
affect the validity of any other provision hereof.

18.  Binding Agreement. All obligations of Debtor hereunder shall bind the
heirs, agents and attorneys-in-fact, successors and assigns of Debtor. If there
be more than one Debtor, their liabilities shall be joint and several. All
rights of RACC hereunder shall inure to the benefit of its successors and
assigns.

<PAGE>

19.  Assignment. RACC may transfer or assign all or any part of its interest in
this Security Agreement without the consent of Debtor or any other party. Debtor
shall not sell, assign, transfer, encumber or convey any of its interests in the
Collateral or in this Security Agreement without the prior written consent of
RACC.

20.  Entire Agreement. This Security Agreement, the Restructuring Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement between and
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no verbal
understandings, agreements, representations or warranties not expressly set
forth herein. Neither this Security Agreement, the Restructuring Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents shall be changed orally, but only by
writing signed by the parties hereto.

21.  Miscellaneous. Time is of the essence hereof. RACC's failure to insist on
performance of any of the terms and conditions contained in this Security
Agreement, the Restructuring Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or to
exercise any right or benefit will not constitute a waiver unless the waiver is
in writing, executed by an authorized representative of RACC. RACC's waiver of
any default hereunder or thereunder will not thereafter waive those terms,
conditions, rights or privileges, whether of the same or a similar type.

DEBTOR HEREIN ACKNOWLEDGES THAT DEBTOR HAS READ AND FULLY UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT. BY EXECUTION HEREOF, THE
UNDERSIGNED HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT HE/SHE IS DULY AUTHORIZED TO EXECUTE THIS
SECURITY AGREEMENT IN THE CAPACITY STATED BELOW.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                      GREAT LAKES AVIATION, LTD. ANNOUNCES
          COMPLETION OF FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING AND PROMOTION OF CHUCK
                        HOWELL TO CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

CHEYENNE, Wyo., December 31 - Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd. (OTC Bulletin Board:
GLUX - news) announced today that it has successfully completed the
restructuring of the aircraft financing provided by Raytheon Aircraft Credit
Corporation ("RACC") to Great Lakes with respect to its fleet of Beech 1900D and
1900C Aircraft. This restructuring, which Great Lakes and RACC began discussing
earlier this year, results in significant improvements to Great Lakes' cost
structure and balance sheet, as well as a 36% equity holding by RACC. It also
returns Great Lakes to a current status with regard to all of its RACC debt and
lease obligations.

Effective with the completion of the financial restructuring, Great Lakes has
appointed Charles R. Howell IV as its Chief Executive Officer. Douglas G. Voss,
Great Lakes' former Chief Executive Officer, will continue to serve in his
capacity as Chairman of Great Lakes' Board of Directors.

Mr. Howell was brought to the company in August of this year as Chief Operating
Officer in order to strengthen the management team. Prior to joining Great Lakes
he served most recently as President and CEO of Corporate Airlines, a Nashville
based regional airline that he co-founded in 1996.

Mr. Howell, the company's new CEO, stated, "This restructuring is a tremendous
boost for Great Lakes and its long partnership with Raytheon. We look forward to
being better able to serve our customers and to build a stronger company for our
existing and new shareholders. Our employees, our code-share partners, and our
other stakeholders will also benefit from this accomplishment."

Great Lakes' Chairman of the Board Douglas G. Voss said, "I am pleased with the
results that Chuck's capable and experienced airline management skills have had
on our operation since joining Great Lakes. The new ideas and skills Chuck
brings, combined with the company's improved financial position, will greatly
enhance Great Lakes' future performance."

As of November 1, 2002, scheduled passenger service was being provided at 47
airports in fifteen states with a fleet of Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias and
Raytheon/Beech 1900D regional airliners. A total of 212 weekday flights are
scheduled at four hubs, with 172 flights at Denver, 20 flights at Chicago -
O'Hare International Airport, 14 flights at Minneapolis/St. Paul, and 6 flights
at Phoenix.

<PAGE>
                                      -41-

All scheduled flights are operated under the Great Lakes Airlines marketing
identity in conjunction with code-share agreements with United Airlines and
Frontier Airlines.

The foregoing release contains forward-looking terminology, which is made
pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risk and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected. Potential purchaser's of the company's securities are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements which are qualified
in their entirety by the cautions and risks filed by the company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

                SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND COVENANT NOT TO EXECUTE

     THIS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND COVENANT NOT TO EXECUTE (this "Agreement"),
dated as of August 1, 2002, is made by and between FINOVA CAPITAL CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation ("FINOVA"), and GREAT LAKES AVIATION, LTD., an Iowa
corporation ("Great Lakes").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, FINOVA is a commercial finance and leasing company headquartered
in Scottsdale, Arizona; and

     WHEREAS, FINOVA, among other things, leases commercial aircraft to airlines
and other aircraft operators; and

     WHEREAS, Great Lakes operates as a commercial passenger airline certified
by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration; and

     WHEREAS, FINOVA, as lessor, and Great Lakes, as lessee, are parties to a
Lease Agreement [N281UE] dated as of October 19, 1995, as thereafter
supplemented and amended (the "N92GL Lease"), concerning the lease of an Embraer
model EMB-120RT aircraft, bearing manufacturer's serial number 120.092 and
current U.S. Registration No. N92GL, together with two (2) Pratt & Whitney model
PW-118 aircraft engines associated therewith (the "N92GL Aircraft"); and

     WHEREAS, one or more "Events of Default" (as defined by the N92GL Lease)
have occurred and are continuing; and

     WHEREAS, as a result of (a) such Events of Default and (b) disputes arising
in connection with another aircraft lease agreement between FINOVA and Great
Lakes (the "Other Great Lakes Lease"), FINOVA filed a two-count complaint (the
"Complaint") against Great Lakes in the United States District Court for the
District of Arizona (the "Court"), Case No. CIV 02-0362-PHX-SMM; and

     WHEREAS, in Count Two of the Complaint, FINOVA alleges that Great Lakes
owes FINOVA, pursuant to the N92GL Lease, the amount of $1,239,288.56 plus
interest accruing on the unpaid balance thereof at the "Overdue Rate" (as
defined by the N92GL Lease) from and after February 20, 2002; and

     WHEREAS, FINOVA is negotiating an agreement with another entity for the
re-lease of the N92GL Aircraft (the "New Lease"), which (should such New Lease
become effective) will reduce the amounts owing by Great Lakes under the N92GL
Lease; and

     WHEREAS, FINOVA and Great Lakes wish to memorialize their agreement
concerning, among other things: (a) the return to FINOVA of the N92GL Aircraft,
including the

<PAGE>

identity of the aircraft engines which shall be attached thereto, (b) the
exchange of engine titles which will be required to allow for such a return of
the N92GL Aircraft by Great Lakes; (c) the determination of the total remaining
amount owing by Great Lakes pursuant to the N92GL Lease and Count Two of the
Complaint; (d) reducing such amount to a judgment on Count Two as entered by the
Court; and (e) FINOVA's covenant to refrain from executing upon such judgment so
long as Great Lakes makes payments owing to FINOVA pursuant to this Agreement;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein,
FINOVA and Great Lakes hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Definitions.

          (a) All of the definitions set forth in the above recitals are hereby
incorporated in this Section 1 as if fully set forth herein.

          (b) Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, all capitalized terms
appearing herein shall have the meaning as set forth in the N92GL Lease.

     2.   Return of the N92GL Aircraft to FINOVA. FINOVA and Great Lakes hereby
acknowledge that Great Lakes has returned to FINOVA the N92GL Aircraft,
including two (2) Pratt & Whitney model PW-l18 aircraft engines bearing

obligations pursuant to this Agreement, such delivery on the part of Great Lakes
was performed in full and complete compliance with the return condition
requirements of the N92GL Lease, including, without limitation, Section 6
thereof.

     3.   Termination of N92GL Lease, The N92GL Lease is hereby terminated
(subject to the satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent to the
effectiveness of this Agreement, as set forth in Section 9 hereof). To the
extent requested by FINOVA: (a) Great Lakes shall execute all documents
(prepared by FINOVA at its expense) which are reasonably required to terminate
the N92GL Lease as a matter of record at the Federal Aviation Administration;
and (b) shall make all payments and perform all other acts reasonably required
to release the N92GL Aircraft from any liens or encumbrances (including, without
limitation, mechanics liens) attached to the N92GL Aircraft which were created
by or through Great Lakes.

     4.   Engine Title Swap.

          (a) Engine 115434 (which is being delivered to FINOVA pursuant to

required to release Engine 115434 from the Other Great Lakes Lease.

          (b) Engine 115491 (which also is being delivered to FINOVA pursuant to
Section 2 hereof) is owned by Great Lakes. Contemporaneously with the execution
of this Agreement, Great Lakes shall convey to FINOVA, free and clear of all

<PAGE>

Engine 115491 "as is, where is," as more fully set forth in the Bill of Sale
115491.

          (c) FINOVA owns a separate Pratt & Whitney model PW-118 engine bearing
manufacturer's serial number 115484 ("Engine 115484"). FINOVA hereby agrees to
transfer to Great Lakes title to Engine 115484 (and Great Lakes agrees to accept
such title) in exchange for obtaining title to Engine 115491. Contemporaneously
with the execution of this Agreement, FINOVA shall convey to Great Lakes, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances, title to Engine 115484 by executing and
delivering to Great Lakes the Engine Bill of Sale in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit "B" (the "Bill of Sale 115484"). Great Lakes accepts Engine 115484 "as
is, where is," as more fully set forth in the Bill of Sale 115484.

     5.   Determination of Remaining Amount Owing Under N92GL Lease. After (a)
taking into account all amounts owing by Great Lakes pursuant to the N92GL Lease
(as alleged in Count Two of the Complaint) and (b) applying all proper offsets
and adjustments (including, without limitation (i) the amount of all shortfalls
and overages resulting from the condition of the N92GL Aircraft upon its return
to FINOVA pursuant to Section 2 hereof and (ii) the amount of rent to be
received by FINOVA pursuant to the New Lease), FINOVA and Great Lakes hereby
agree that the remaining amount owing by Great Lakes to FINOVA under the N92GL
Lease is (and shall be fixed at) $722,089.99 (the "Remaining N92GL Debt") plus
interest which shall accrue on the balance thereof at the rate often percent
(10%) per annum from the date hereof until paid in full.

     6.   Entry of Stipulated Judgment.

          (a) The parties hereto agree to stipulate to the entry of a judgment
on Count Two of the Complaint in the amount of the Remaining N92GL Debt plus
interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. Contemporaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, legal counsel for each of the parties hereto shall
(i) execute and file with the Court a Stipulation for the Entry of Judgment in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit "C" (the "Stipulation") and (ii) perform all
other acts reasonably required to effect the entry by the Court of the judgment
requested in the Stipulation (the "Judgment").

          (b) The parties hereto agree that all claims, defenses and offsets
alleged and which could have been alleged by either FINOVA or Great Lakes
arising out of or otherwise concerning (a) the N92GL Lease or (b) any actions
taken (or not taken) by FINOVA or Great Lakes in connection with the the N92GL
Lease shall be merged into the Judgment and are otherwise fully released.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall affect or constitute a waiver of FINOVA's right to prosecute
Count One of the Complaint or Great Lakes' right to assert defenses against
liability under Count One; provided, however, that FINOVA hereby agrees to work
with Great Lakes in good faith to try to re-lease the aircraft subject to the
Other Great Lakes Lease.

<PAGE>

     7.   Covenant not to Execute upon Judgment.

          (a) So long as a Payment Default (as defined in Section 8(c) hereof)
does not occur, FINOVA shall not (i) take any action to domesticate or enforce
the Judgment in any state or federal court, including, but not limited to,
causing any writs of execution, garnishment or attachment to be issued, served
or recorded, (ii) perform any act to create a judgment lien on any assets of
Great Lakes in enforcement of the Judgment or (iii) take any other acts to
collect upon or enforce the Judgment.

          (b) Immediately upon the occurrence of a Payment Default and without
further notice to any person or entity: (i) Section 7(a) hereof shall be of no
further force and effect; and (ii) FINOVA may take any and all steps allowed at
law to collect upon or otherwise enforce its rights under the Judgment. Any
payments made to FINOVA pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof shall be applied as an
offset against (and in satisfaction to the extent of the payment of) the amounts
owing pursuant to the Judgment.

     8.   Payment Obligations.

          (a) As a condition to FINOVA agreeing and continuing to forbear from
the enforcement of the Judgment pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof, Great Lakes
hereby agrees to satisfy the Remaining N92GL Debt by making forty-eight (48)
consecutive monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of
$18,314.07 each month (each, a "Required Payment," and collectively, the
"Required Payments") pursuant to the payment schedule attached hereto as Exhibit
"D." Each Required Payment shall be due on the first day of each month
(commencing on September 1, 2002) and shall continue until the Remaining N92GL
Debt (including interest) is fully satisfied.

          (b) All of the Required Payments owing to FINOVA pursuant to Section
8(a) hereof shall be made by the wire-transfer of immediately-available funds
(in United States Dollars) to the following account:

          Reference:         Great Lakes/N92GL

Any Required Payment owing on a day other than a Business Day (as defined in the
N92GL Lease) shall be owing on the next Business Day.

          (c) Great Lakes shall be in default of its payment obligations
pursuant to this Agreement (a "Payment Default") should Great Lakes fail to make
any Required Payment owing to FINOVA within three (3) Business Days after Great
Lakes' receipt of written notice (pursuant to the requirements of Section 15
hereof) informing Great Lakes of its failure to make such Required Payment.

          (d) Great Lakes, without penalty, shall have the right at any time to
prepay part or all of the principal balance of the Remaining N92GL Debt (plus
any accrued but unpaid

                                        4

<PAGE>

interest) existing as of such time. In the case of a partial prepayment, the
amount of the Required Payments owing pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof will

one or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which

contrary herein, all demands, notices and other communications allowed or

          (a) Until this Agreement terminates pursuant to Section 7 hereof,
Great Lakes hereby agrees to make the following payments to FINOVA in
immediately-available funds

                                        2

(without any right of set-oft) pursuant to wire transfer instructions as
provided by FINOVA to Great Lakes in writing from time to time:

              (i) On the date hereof and on the first Business Day of each
     consecutive month hereafter until and including April 1, 2003, Great Lakes
     shall make a payment to FINOVA in the amount of Ten Thousand Dollars
     ($10,000.00); and

              (ii) On May 1, 2003 and on the first Business Day of each
     consecutive month thereafter until and including October 1, 2003, Great
     Lakes shall make a payment to FINOVA in the amount of Fifteen Thousand
     Dollars ($15,000.00).

Such payments shall be applied by FINOVA pursuant to the requirements of the
N85GL Lease.

          (b) Great Lakes shall continue to store, maintain and insure the

4(a)(i) of this Agreement and (b) the filing with the Court of the
fully-executed "Stipulation" (as defined in the N92GL Settlement Agreement).

     6.   Compliance with Agreement. So long as (a) Great Lakes makes each
payment required by Section 4(a) hereof within three (3) Business Days after the
due date for such payment, (b) Great Lakes complies with its obligations under
Section 4(b) of this Agreement, (c) Great Lakes complies with all of its
obligations under the N92GL Settlement Agreement and (d) an Event of Default
does not arise pursuant to Section 17.3, 17.4, 17.10, 17.11, 17.12 or 17.13 of
the N85GL Lease, FINOVA hereby agrees that it shall not, during the term of this
Agreement, take any action to enforce its rights or remedies under the N85GL
Lease. Should any of the foregoing events occur (a "Deferral Agreement Breach"),
or should this Agreement otherwise terminate pursuant to Section 7 hereof,
FINOVA shall have the right to proceed with the enforcement of its rights and
remedies under the N85GL Lease.

     7.   Termination.

          (a) Subject to any earlier termination pursuant to this Section 7,
this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect on and
after November 1, 2003.

          (b) Notwithstanding the withdrawal by FINOVA of its notices of Default
and Events of Default, FINOVA shall have the right during the term of this
Agreement to attempt to remarket the Aircraft (by either a lease or sale
thereof) to any third party. Should FINOVA enter into a binding agreement during
the term of this Agreement to either lease or sell the Aircraft, this Agreement
shall terminate on the effective date of such a lease or on the transfer of
title pursuant to such a sale. Great Lakes' remaining payment obligations owing
to FINOVA pursuant to the N85GL Lease (if any) shall be determined under the
N85GL Lease as if an Event of Default were in effect as of the termination of
this Agreement under this Section 7(b). Nothing in this Section 7(b), however,
shall affect the obligations which FINOVA may have pursuant to the Lease and as
a matter of law to act reasonably to mitigate its damages.

                                        3

<PAGE>

          (c) FINOVA shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
immediately upon the occurrence of a Deferral Agreement Breach (pursuant to
Section 6 hereof).

Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default pursuant to Section 17.10 or 17.11 of the N85GL Lease.

          (e) Should an Event of Loss arise in respect of the Airframe, and upon
FINOVA receiving all amounts owing to it under Section 13.1 of the Lease as a
result of such Event of Loss, this Agreement shall terminate automatically
without any further notice.

     8.   Release of Liability. In consideration of the mutual covenants set
forth in this Agreement, Great Lakes hereby releases FINOVA (and its successors
and assigns and the officers, directors, employees, attorneys and other agents
of FINOVA and its successors and assigns) of any and all liability, claims and
damages (collectively, "Claims") existing as of the date hereof, known and
unknown, relating to or arising out of the N85GL Lease or the enforcement by
FINOVA of any of its rights thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Section 8 shall act (a) to release FINOVA from the obligation to perform
pursuant to this Agreement or (b) to release FINOVA from any Claims which may
arise after the date hereof.

     9.   Captions. All captions and section headings used in this Agreement are
for convenience only and shall not in any manner be deemed to limit or restrict

WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA.

        disability payments or (C) by any tribunal or court. Upon request of the
        Board of Directors (or if there be only two members of the Board of
        Directors) by any member of the Board of Directors, Employee agrees to
        submit to successive medical examinations by such physicians as may be
        designated by the Board of Directors and shall consent to the disclosure
        of the results of such examinations and a prognosis relative to
        Employee's condition. Any and all such examinations shall be conducted
        at the expense of the Company.

                4.4     By Company for Cause. Company may terminate Employee's
        employment hereunder for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, Company
        shall have "Cause" to terminate Employee's employment hereunder upon (i)
        the material failure by Employee to perform his duties hereunder if such
        failure has not been cured within ten days after written demand for
        performance is delivered by Company that specifically identifies the
        manner in which Company believes Employee has not performed his duties,
        (ii) the willful engaging by Employee in conduct which evidences a
        disregard for the interests of Company, momentarily or otherwise,
        including material violation of the established rules, regulations and
        policies of Company or (iii) the commission by Employee of a felony,
        gross misdemeanor or act of dishonesty.

                4.5     By Employee for Company's Breach. Prior to the
        Expiration Date, Employee may terminate his employment hereunder for a
        failure by Company to comply with any material provision of this
        Agreement which has not been cured within ten (10) days after written
        notice of such noncompliance has been given by Employee to Company.

                4.6     Notice of Termination. Any termination of Employee's
        employment by Company or by Employee (other than termination pursuant to
        Subsection 4.2 hereof) shall be communicated by written Notice of
        Termination to the other party hereto.

                4.7     Date of Termination. "Date of Termination" shall mean:
        (a) if Employee's employment is terminated by his death, the date of his
        death; (b) if Employee is eliminated from the Board of Directors, by the
        effective date of such elimination; and (c) if Employee's employment is
        terminated for any other reason, the date on which a Notice of
        Termination is given.

        5.      Compensation Upon Termination or During Disability.

                5.1     During Disability. During any period that Employee fails
        to perform his duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to
        physical or mental illness ("disability period"), Employee shall
        continue to receive the full compensation for which he is entitled to
        offset by his base draw(offset by any payments to Employee received
        pursuant to disability benefit plans maintained by Company or disability
        benefits from governmental entities) until his employment resumes or is
        terminated pursuant to Section 4 hereof, and upon such termination,
        Employee shall be entitled to all amounts to which Employee is entitled
        pursuant

                                        3

<PAGE>
>

        to Company disability plans, programs and policies all in accordance
        with the terms thereof.

                5.2     Death. If Employee's employment is terminated by his
        death, Company shall, within ten days following the date of Employee's
        death, pay to Employee's estate or Employee's designated beneficiary the
        full amount of compensation owed to him through the Date of Termination,
        and, thereafter, payment of any other amounts to which Employee is
        entitled pursuant to Company death benefit plans, programs and policies
        in accordance with the terms thereof.

                5.3     Termination Without Cause. Employee shall be an at-will
        employee of the Company. Employee may be terminated by the Company at
        any time for any reason, or no reason, upon six months written notice.
        Employee may terminate his employment upon six months notice. If
        Employee is terminated by the Company without cause or by Employee
        because of Company's breach of this Agreement, Employee shall receive
        his regular base pay for the remainder of the contract period. Stock
        options, if any, shall continue to vest during the remainder of the
        contract period.

                5.4     Termination With Cause. If Employee is terminated with
        Cause, compensation shall be paid to Employee through the Date of
        Termination and all unvested stock options, if any, will terminate as of
        that date.

        6.      Non-Disclosure. Employee acknowledges that he has received and
will continue to receive and contribute to the production of confidential
information concerning the Company's business, or in certain cases, the business
of its customers ("Confidential Information"). Except as required by his duties
hereunder, Employee will not, either during his employment by Company or at any
time thereafter, use any Confidential Information for his own benefit or
disclose any Confidential Information to any third person. Employee agrees to
refrain from any acts or omissions that would reduce the value of the
Confidential Information. Upon termination of Employee's employment with
Company, Employee shall leave with or return to Company all records,
correspondence, compositions, articles, writing, programs, codes, devices,
equipment, other papers which incorporate, embody or disclose any Confidential
Information (whether written, prepared or made by Employee or others), including
all copies and memorializations thereof. The obligations set forth in this
Section 6 shall not apply to any information or knowledge the entirety of which
is now publicly known or subsequently becomes publicly known, other than as a
direct or indirect result of the breach of this Agreement by Employee or the
breach of a confidentiality obligation owed to Company by any third party. For
the purposes hereof:

                (a)     The term "Confidential Information" means all
        information or material proprietary to Company or designated as
        Confidential Information by Company or by a customer of the Company and
        not generally known by non-Company personnel, of or to which Employee
        obtains knowledge or access through or as a result of Employee's
        relationship (whether prior or subsequent to

                                        4

<PAGE>
>

        the date hereof) with Company (including information conceived,
        originated, discovered or developed in whole or in part by Employee).
        Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, the following
        types of information and other information of a similar nature (whether
        or not reduced to writing), discoveries, inventions (whether or not
        patentable), ideas, concepts, software in various stages of development,
        designs, drawings, specifications, techniques, models, data, devices,
        source codes, object codes, documentation, formulae, patterns,
        computations, diagrams, flow charts, research and development data,
        programs, processes, procedures, know-how, Trade Secrets, marketing
        techniques and materials, strategies, marketing and development plans,
        customer names and other information related to customers, price lists,
        pricing policies and financial information. Confidential Information
        also includes any information described above which Company obtains from
        another party and which Company treats as proprietary or designates as
        Confidential Information, whether or not owned by or developed by
        Company.

                (b)     The term "Trade Secrets" means information, including a
        formula pattern, compilation, program device, method, technique or
        process, that derives independent economic value, actual or potential,
        from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
        by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its
        disclosure or use, and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable
        under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

        7.      Intellectual Property.

                (a)     Disclosure and Assignment. Employee shall promptly
        disclose in writing to Company complete information concerning each and
        every invention, discovery, improvement, device, design, apparatus,
        practice, process, method or product, whether patentable or not, made,
        developed, perfected, devised, authored, conceived or first reduced to
        practice by Employee, either solely or in collaboration with others,
        during the term of this Agreement, whether or not during regular working
        hours, relating either directly or indirectly to the business, products,
        practices or techniques of the employer (hereinafter referred to as
        "Developments"). Employee, to the extent that he has the legal right to
        do so, hereby acknowledges that any and all of such Developments are the
        property of Company and hereby assigns and agrees to assign to Company
        any and all of Employee's right, title and interest in and to any and
        all of such Developments.

                (b)     Limitation on Section 7(a). The provisions of Section
        7(a) shall not apply to any Development meeting the following
        conditions:

                        (i)     such Development was developed entirely on
                Employee's own time; and

                        (ii)    such Development was made without the use of any
                Company equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret
                information; and

                                        5

<PAGE>
>

                        (iii)   such Development does not relate (A) directly to
                the business of Company, or (B) to Company's actual or
                demonstrably anticipated research or development; and

                        (iv)    such Development does not result from any work
                performed by Employee for Company.

                (c)     Assistance of Employee. Upon request and without further
        compensation therefor, but at no expense to Employee, and whether during
        the term of this Agreement or thereafter, Employee shall do all lawful
        acts, including, but not limited to, the execution of papers and lawful
        oaths and the giving of testimony, that in the opinion of Company, its
        successors and assigns, may be necessary or desirable in obtaining,
        sustaining, reissuing, extending and enforcing United States and foreign
        Letters Patent, including, but not limited to, design patents, on any
        and all of such Developments, and for perfecting, affirming and
        recording Company's complete ownership and title thereto, and to
        cooperate otherwise in all proceedings and matters relating thereto.

                (d)     Records. Employee shall keep complete, accurate and
        authentic accounts, notes, data and records of all Developments in the
        manner and form requested by Company. Such accounts, notes, data and
        records shall be the property of Company, and, upon its request,
        Employee shall promptly surrender same to it or, if not previously
        surrendered upon its request or otherwise, Employee shall surrender the
        same, and all copies thereof, to Company upon the conclusion of his
        employment.

                (e)     Obligations, Restrictions and Limitations. Employee
        understands that Company may enter into agreements or arrangements with
        agencies of the United States Government, and that Company may be
        subject to laws and regulations which impose obligations, restrictions
        and limitations on it with respect to inventions and patents which may
        be acquired by it or which may be conceived or developed by employees,
        consultants or other agents rendering services to it. Employee agrees
        that he shall be bound by all such obligations, restrictions and
        limitations applicable to any such invention conceived or developed by
        him during the term of this Agreement and shall take any and all further
        action which may be required to discharge such obligations and to comply
        with such restrictions and limitations.

        8.      Covenant Not To Compete. Employee agrees that during his
employment by Company, while receiving compensation under this Agreement and for
one year following Employee's Date of Termination, whichever occurs later, he
shall not, unless agreed to in writing by the Company, directly or indirectly,
in any manner or capacity (whether alone or as a partner, joint venturer or
stockholder, or creditor, agent, advisor, officer, director or employee for any
person, or through any agency or by any other means whatsoever) engage in any
activity or conduct which competes with any business conducted by the Company or
call upon or otherwise solicit any Accounts or

                                        6

<PAGE>
>

Customers. For the purposes hereof "Accounts" and "Customers" shall mean any
Accounts or Customers which the Company has done business with within the
24-month period preceding the termination of Employee's employment, or any
Accounts or Customers to whom the Company has made a business proposal to or
solicited business from. Employee acknowledges that this Covenant Not To Compete
was contained in Company's initial offer of employment to Employee and was an
integral part of said offer of employment.

        9.      Injunctive Relief. Employee acknowledges and agrees that it
would be difficult to compensate Company fully for damages for any violation of
the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement. Accordingly, Employee
specifically agrees that Company shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, that such relief
may be granted without the necessity of proving actual damages, and that, in
connection with any such proceeding Employee shall waive and hereby waives the
defense that Company has an adequate remedy at law. This provision with respect
to injunctive relief shall not, however, diminish the right of Company to claim
and recover damages in addition to injunctive relief. If any court shall
determine that Company is entitled to injunctive relief, Company shall not be
required to furnish a bond to obtain such preliminary or temporary relief.

        10.     Arbitration. Any claims or disputes of any nature between the
parties arising from or related to the performance, breach, termination,
expiration, application or meaning of this Agreement shall be resolved
exclusively by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association, pursuant
to the Association's rules for commercial arbitration.

                (a)     The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and
        binding upon both parties. Judgment on the award rendered by the
        arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. In
        the event of submission of any dispute to arbitration, each party shall,
        not later than 30 days prior to the date set for hearing, provide to the
        other party and to the arbitrator(s) a copy of all exhibits upon which
        the party intends to rely at the hearing and a list of all persons whom
        each party intends to call as witnesses at the hearing.

                (b)     This paragraph 10 shall have no application to claims by
        the Company asserting violations of or seeking to enforce, by injunction
        or otherwise, regarding the Noncompetition, Confidentiality and
        Inventions provisions of this Agreement. Such claims may be maintained
        by the Company in a lawsuit

        11.     Miscellaneous.

                11.1    Recitals. The recitals to this Agreement are true and
        correct and constitute a part of this Agreement.

                11.2    No Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or
        obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by any party hereto
        without the written consent of the other parties.

                11.3    Remedies Cumulative. No remedy conferred by any of the
        specific provisions of this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any
        other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be
        in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
        existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise. The election of
        any one or more remedies by any party hereto shall not constitute a
        waiver of the right to pursue other available remedies.

                11.4    Notices. All notice, requests, and other communications
        from any of the parties hereto to another shall be in writing and shall

        notice shall be deemed to be received when delivered if delivered
        personally, upon receipt of electronic sent confirmation (or other
        confirmation of receipt) if telecopied, the next business day if sent by
        a national overnight delivery service, or three business days after the
        date mailed if sent by certified or registered mail. Any notice of any
        change in such address shall also be given in the manner set forth
        above. Whenever the giving of notice is required, the giving of such
        notice may be waived in writing by the party entitled to receive such
        notice.

                11.5    Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by,
        construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Iowa.

                11.6    Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement constitutes
        the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior and contemporaneous
        agreements and undertaking, both written and oral, among the parties
        hereto relating to the subject matter hereof. There are no
        representations, warranties, covenants, statements, conditions, terms of
        obligations other than those contained herein or relating to the subject
        matter hereof. No amendments or modifications to or variations of this
        Agreement shall be deemed valid unless in writing and executed by
        Employee and Company.

                11.7    Meanings of Pronouns; Singular and Plural Words. All
        pronouns used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the
        masculine, feminine, neuter, singular and plural, as the identity of the
        person to which or to whom reference is made may require. Unless the
        context in which any word is used shall clearly indicate to the
        contrary, words used in the singular shall include the plural, and words
        used in the plural shall include the singular.

                11.8    Interpretation. When a reference is made in this
        Agreement to Sections or Subsections such reference shall be to a
        Section or Subsection of this

                                        8

<PAGE>
>

        Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
        "includes," or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
        deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

                11.9    Benefit. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
        and be enforceable by Employee or by Employee's personal and legal
        representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, devisees and
        legatees.

                11.10   Severability; Blue Pencil. To the extent that any
        provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or
        unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable portion of such provision
        shall be deleted from this Agreement, and the validity and
        enforceability of the remainder of such provision and of this Agreement
        shall be unaffected. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the
        foregoing, it is expressly agreed that should the duration of or
        geographical extent of, or business activities covered by, the
        noncompetition covenant contained in Section 8 be determined to be in
        excess of that which is valid or enforceable under applicable law, then
        such provision shall be construed to cover only that duration, extent,
        or those activities which may validly or enforceably be covered.
        Employee acknowledges the uncertainty of the law in this respect and
        expressly stipulates that this Agreement shall be construed in a manner
        which renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent
        (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law.

                11.11   No Waiver. No delay on the part of either party in
        exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such right,
        nor shall any waiver, express or implied, by either party of any right
        hereunder, or of any failure to perform hereunder or breach hereof by
        either party, constitute or be deemed to constitute a waiver of any
        other failure to perform hereunder or breach hereof by either party,
        whether of a similar or dissimilar nature thereto.

                11.12   Attorneys' Fees. If any litigation shall ensue between
        the parties concerning the interpretation of or performance under this
        Agreement, the prevailing party shall recover from the nonprevailing
        party its reasonable attorneys' and other fees and expenses, if and to
        the extent fixed by the court.

                11.13   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
        more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but
        all of which counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
        instrument.

                11.14   Survival. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 shall
        survive any termination of this Agreement and the termination of
        Employee's employment hereunder irrespective of the date of occurrence.

and agreements hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration,

hereinafter set forth.

        1.      Employment; Duties. During Employee's employment hereunder, he
shall serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and have the overall

entirety of which is now publicly known or subsequently becomes publicly known,

        information or material proprietary to Company or designated as

        Company treats as proprietary or designates as Confidential Information,
        whether or not owned by or developed by Company.

                (b)     The term "Trade Secrets" means information, including a
        formula pattern, compilation, program device, method, technique or
        process, that derives independent economic value, actual or potential,
        from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
        by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its
        disclosure or use, and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable
        under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

                (a)     Disclosure and Assignment. Employee shall promptly
        disclose in writing to Company complete information concerning each and

        in and to any and all of such Developments.

                (b)     Limitation on Section 7(a). The provisions of Section

        conditions:

                        (i)     such Development was developed entirely on
                Employee's own time; and

                        (ii)    such Development was made without the use of any
                Company equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret
                information; and

                the business of Company, or (B) to Company's actual or
                demonstrably anticipated research or development; and

                        (iv)    such Development does not result from any work
                performed by Employee for Company.

                (c)     Assistance of Employee. Upon request and without further
        compensation therefor, but at no expense to Employee, and whether during
        the term of this Agreement or thereafter, Employee shall do all lawful
        acts, including, but not limited to, the execution of papers and lawful
        oaths and the giving of testimony, that in the opinion of Company, its
        successors and assigns, may be necessary or desirable in obtaining,
        sustaining, reissuing, extending and enforcing United States and foreign
        Letters Patent, including, but not limited to, design patents, on any
        and all of such Developments, and for perfecting, affirming and
        recording Company's complete ownership and title thereto, and to
        cooperate otherwise in all proceedings and matters relating thereto.

                (d)     Records. Employee shall keep complete, accurate and
        authentic accounts, notes, data and records of all Developments in the
        manner and form requested by Company. Such accounts, notes, data and
        records shall be the property of Company, and, upon its request,
        Employee shall promptly surrender same to it or, if not previously
        surrendered upon its request or otherwise, Employee shall surrender the
        same, and all copies thereof, to Company upon the conclusion of his
        employment.

                (e)     Obligations, Restrictions and Limitations. Employee
        understands that Company may enter into agreements or arrangements with
        agencies of the United States Government, and that Company may be
        subject to laws and regulations which impose obligations, restrictions
        and limitations on it with respect to inventions and patents which may
        be acquired by it or which may be conceived or developed by employees,
        consultants or other agents rendering services to it. Employee agrees
        that he shall be bound by all such obligations,

                                        6

<PAGE>

        restrictions and limitations applicable to any such invention conceived
        or developed by him during the term of this Agreement and shall take any
        and all further action which may be required to discharge such
        obligations and to comply with such restrictions and limitations.

        8.      Covenant Not To Compete. Employee agrees that during his
employment by Company, while receiving compensation under this Agreement and for
one year following Employee's Date of Termination, whichever occurs later, he
shall not, unless agreed to in writing by the Company, directly or indirectly,
in any manner or capacity (whether alone or as a partner, joint venturer or
stockholder, or creditor, agent, advisor, officer, director or employee for any
person, or through any agency or by any other means whatsoever) engage in any
activity or conduct which competes with any business conducted by the Company or
call upon or otherwise solicit any Accounts or Customers. For the purposes
hereof "Accounts" and "Customers" shall mean any Accounts or Customers which the
Company has done business with within the 24-month period preceding the
termination of Employee's employment, or any Accounts or Customers to whom the

acknowledges that this Covenant Not To Compete was contained in Company's
initial offer of employment to Employee and was an integral part of said offer
of employment.

        9.      Injunctive Relief. Employee acknowledges and agrees that it
would be difficult to compensate Company fully for damages for any violation of
the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement. Accordingly, Employee
specifically agrees that Company shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, that such relief
may be granted without the necessity of proving actual damages, and that, in
connection with any such proceeding Employee shall waive and hereby waives the
defense that Company has an adequate remedy at law. This provision with respect
to injunctive relief shall not, however, diminish the right of Company to claim
and recover damages in addition to injunctive relief. If any court shall
determine that Company is entitled to injunctive relief, Company shall not be
required to furnish a bond to obtain such preliminary or temporary relief.

        10.     Arbitration. Any claims or disputes of any nature between the
parties arising from or related to the performance, breach, termination,
expiration, application or meaning of this Agreement shall be resolved

        binding upon both parties. Judgment on the award rendered by the
        arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. In
        the event of submission of any dispute to arbitration, each party shall,
        not later than 30 days prior to the date set for hearing, provide to the
        other party and to the arbitrator(s) a copy of all exhibits upon which
        the party intends to rely at the hearing and a list of all persons whom

        legatees.

                11.10   Severability; Blue Pencil. To the extent that any
        provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or
        unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable portion of such provision
        shall be deleted from this Agreement, and the validity and
        enforceability of the remainder of such provision and of this Agreement
        shall be unaffected. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the
        foregoing, it is expressly agreed that should the duration of or
        geographical extent of, or business activities covered by, the
        noncompetition covenant contained in Section 8 be determined to be in
        excess of that which is valid or enforceable under applicable law, then
        such provision shall be construed to cover only that duration, extent,
        or those activities which may validly or enforceably be covered.
        Employee acknowledges the uncertainty of the law in this respect and
        expressly stipulates that this Agreement shall be construed in a manner
        which renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent
        (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law.

        exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such right,
        nor shall any waiver, express or implied, by either party of any right
        hereunder, or of any failure to perform hereunder or breach hereof by
        either party, constitute or be deemed to constitute a waiver of any
        other failure to perform hereunder or breach hereof by either party,
        whether of a similar or dissimilar nature thereto.

further document the terms and conditions of this lease restructuring proposal
(the "Settlement Agreement") and the Lease be amended in accordance with the
Settlement Agreement.

  1  Lessor:         Boeing Capital Corporation ("BCC") or any of its
                     affiliates, successors or assigns ("Lessor").

  2  Lessee:         Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd. ("Lessee"), a company
                     incorporated or organized under the laws of Iowa with its
                     principal offices located at Cheyenne, Wyoming.

                     respectively equipped with two (2) Pratt & Whitney model
                     PW118A or PW118B engines (the "Engines") (collectively,
                     together with all records, logs and manuals, and parts,
                     accessories and equipment thereon or attached thereto in

                     under the Lease may be individually or collectively

<PAGE>

  7  Early Lease     Lessor shall have the right in its sole discretion to
     Termination:    terminate the Lease upon no less than 180 days written
                     notice. Lessee shall return the Aircraft in compliance with
                     the return conditions under the Lease on the scheduled
                     return date.

  8  Preferred       The Preferred Shares are to be callable with no dividend if
     Shares:         Lessor exercises its early termination option, except such
                     shares shall not be callable if an event of default has
                     occurred and is continuing.

                     The Preferred Shares are to be issued to Lessor by Lessee
                     in a form and amount (Four Million Five Hundred Thousand
                     Dollars) acceptable to Lessor.

  9  Maintenance     Within ten (10) days following the end of each calendar
     Reserves:       month during the Lease Term, commencing with the month
                     immediately following the month in which the effective date
                     of the Settlement Agreement occurs, through and including
                     the month in which this Lease is terminated or expires and
                     the Aircraft is returned to Lessor in accordance with the
                     terms of the Lease, Lessee will pay to Lessor maintenance
                     reserves ("Maintenance Reserves") based on the number of
                     hours/cycles flown by each Aircraft in the previous month
                     during the Lease Term. The final Maintenance Reserve
                     payment due on the last day of the Lease Term shall include
                     payment for time flown by each Aircraft during the then
                     current month. Maintenance Reserves will be divided into
                     separate categories and separately tracked to cover
                     anticipated scheduled maintenance to be performed on each
                     Airframe, each Engine, each Propeller, each landing gear
                     and each APU. Maintenance Reserve payments per Aircraft
                     will total * per flight hour based on a flight
                     hours-to-cycle ratio of 1:1 as follows:

                     Airframe (C check):                 * per flight hour
                     Engine No.1 (HSI & Overhaul):       * per flight hour
                     Engine No.2 (HSI & Overhaul):       * per flight hour
                     Propeller No. 1:                         * per flight
                     Propeller No. 2:                         * per flight
                     APU (overhaul):                     * per flight hour
                     Landing Gear (overhaul):            * per flight cycle

                     The Maintenance Reserve amounts are subject to reasonable
                     adjustment once each year by Lessor on the anniversary of
                     the effective date of the Settlement Agreement to reflect
                     each Aircraft's utilization, life between maintenance
                     inputs, the levels of industry costs for material and labor
                     related to such maintenance work and the balances of such
                     reserves then currently held compared to anticipated
                     expenses.

                     Upon completion of the specified reimbursable maintenance
                     and payment for such work by Lessee, Lessee will submit to
                     Lessor invoices and other applicable maintenance records
                     that are acceptable to Lessor. Lessor will reimburse Lessee
                     for the actual costs it incurs to complete such heavy
                     maintenance, refurbishment and/or overhauls performed
                     either in-house or by third-party maintenance providers as
                     approved by Lessor, up to the

                     ---------
                     *  Confidential material omitted and filed separately with
                        the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a
                        request for confidential treatment

<PAGE>

                     actual amounts paid by Lessee and not previously reimbursed
                     for the applicable Maintenance Reserve category, provided
                     Lessee submits to Lessor detailed original invoices,
                     acceptable to Lessor, and if applicable, from a mutually
                     acceptable third-party maintenance provider, within 90 days
                     after the Lessee's completion of such work, or Lessee's
                     receipt of invoices from third-party maintenance providers.
                     If, after reimbursement for qualified maintenance, there is
                     excess money in the component's reserve fund, the Lessee
                     may abate future reserve payment for utilization of that
                     component for a period equal to the excess reserve amount
                     divided by the applicable Maintenance Reserve rate.

                     Upon expiry of the Lease Term, Lessor will retain all
                     Maintenance Reserves then held by Lessor unless Lessee
                     consummates the purchase of the Aircraft in accordance with
                     the Lease then Lessee shall be entitled to the balance of
                     the Maintenance Reserve fund.

                     If the Lessor exercises its right of early termination, and
                     Lessee returns the aircraft as per the conditions required
                     under the Lease, Lessor shall return to Lessee the balance
                     of the unapplied Maintenance Reserves based on status and
                     usage data.

  10 Insurance:      Provisions shall remain as set forth in the Lease except
                     that if the Lessee has acquired a Certificate of Insurance
                     from the Federal Aviation Administration under the
                     provisions of Amendment 7 Lessee will provide a copy of the
                     Certificate of Insurance to Lessor and verification that it
                     has notified the Federal Aviation Administration that there
                     are additional insured parties to be covered under the
                     Certificate of Insurance.

  11 Redelivery      Shall remain as set forth in the Lease unless otherwise
     Conditions:     amended to the mutual satisfaction of both parties.

  12 Tax Matters:    Provisions shall remain as set forth in the Lease.

  13 Net Lease:      The Lease will be net, whereby Lessee will be obligated to
                     pay all costs, charges, fees, expenses, imposts, duties and
                     taxes (including any and all trade, value-added, or
                     withholding taxes) associated with the use, possession,
                     control, maintenance, repair, lease, sublease, insurance,
                     storage or operation of the Aircraft except Lessor Taxes.

                     "Lessor Taxes" means:

                     (a)    Taxes imposed solely as a result of activities of
                            Lessor in the jurisdiction imposing the liability

                            transactions contemplated by this Proposal or the
