				 PART I

Item 1.   Business

Overview

          FLYi, Inc. formerly known as Atlantic Coast Airlines Holdings,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("FLYi" or the "Company"), is a holding
company with its primary subsidiary being Independence Air, Inc. ("IA).
IA is an air carrier and provides regularly scheduled low-fare air
service under the brand "Independence Air" to East Coast destinations
with a combination of 132-seat Airbus A319 ("A319") aircraft and 50-seat
Canadair regional jets ("CRJs"), and is introducing A319 service to six
new West Coast destinations between March and May 2005.  Previously, IA
was named and operated as Atlantic Coast Airlines ("ACA").  ACA operated
as a regional airline under code share agreements with United Airlines,
Inc. ("United"), providing service since 1992 as part of the United
Express program, and under code share agreements with Delta Air Lines,
Inc. ("Delta"),  providing service since 1999 as part of the Delta
Connection program.  IA transitioned out of the United Express program
between June 1, 2004 and August 3, 2004 and completed its transition out
of the Delta Connection Program on November 1, 2004.

          The Company is incorporated under the laws of Delaware and its
principal executive offices are located at 45200 Business Court, Dulles,
Virginia 20166.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "the
Company", "we", "us", or "our" refer herein to the holding company FLYi,
Inc.

Independence Air

          Operations under the Independence Air brand as a low-fare
airline with a hub at Washington Dulles International Airport
("Washington Dulles") commenced on June 16, 2004.  Independence Air's
strategy is to capitalize on and stimulate demand for air travel to, from
and through its Washington Dulles hub, utilizing A319 narrowbody aircraft
to primarily serve larger, long haul markets and CRJs to offer frequent
service primarily to smaller, short haul markets from Washington Dulles.
The Independence Air business model is based on providing reliable and
easy to use air transportation with excellent customer service, and
achieving simplicity in operations, high employee and asset productivity
and low overhead to offer low fares.

          As of March 1, 2005, Independence Air operated over 400 flights
on each business day, serving 41 destinations, including four
destinations in Florida plus Las Vegas served by A319s.  Independence Air
has announced its expansion of A319 service to five West Coast
destinations starting between April and May 2005.  In December 2004,
Independence Air reduced its flight schedule in connection with its sale
of four CRJs and announced the closure of two cities effective in January
2005.  In February 2005, Independence Air realigned operations at its
Washington Dulles hub from a continuos flow schedule where flights arrive
and depart continuously throughout the day, to a six bank schedule where
arrivals and departures occur within a short period of time, at various
intervals during the day, facilitating connections to multiple destinations.
These schedule changes were made in coordination with Independence Air's
planned removal of 24 CRJs, as described further below.  As compared to a
continuous flow operation, the six bank schedule will reduce daily
aircraft utilization on the CRJ fleet and, to a lesser extent, the A319
fleet, but will increase connecting opportunities for passengers.

          While Independence Air has been successful in stimulating
demand to, from and through its Washington Dulles hub, through February
2005 it has not achieved the load factor and yields projected in its
original business model and thus has not met revenue projections.

					4

Factors contributing to lower revenues than originally projected included
the addition of new competitive service in markets served by Independence
Air and a lower level of business traffic relative to leisure traffic
than had been anticipated.  This revenue shortfall combined with
unprecedented high fuel prices have caused Independence Air to sustain
higher than anticipated losses and to expend more cash than it
anticipated when it embarked on its strategy of becoming an independent
airline.  To address this situation, Independence Air has undertaken a
number of steps in addition to schedule changes discussed above, including
a financial restructuring and changes in its distribution strategy as
discussed below. While Independence Air believes that these actions have
provided it an opportunity to continue operating through 2005 and into
2006 by improving liquidity and generating additional sales, the Company
is operating in an extremely difficult industry environment that presents
a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the
Company's yield, liquidity and business plan. These are discussed in detail
below in "Business - Risk Factors".

Financial Restructuring

          The airline industry is characterized by high fixed costs,
consisting primarily of aircraft lease and financing costs.  In the
fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, the Company took
the following steps to address liquidity.

A319 Aircraft:

          Independence Air entered into an agreement with Airbus' wholly-
owned affiliate AVSA S.A.R.L. ("AVSA") on November 12, 2004 to amend its
purchase agreement for 16 Airbus A319 aircraft.  Under the terms of the
amended aircraft purchase agreement, delivery of ten A319s originally
scheduled for 2005 has been rescheduled to 2007.  The rescheduling of
aircraft deliveries to 2007 reduced the amount of pre-delivery payments
due in 2004 and 2005 under the purchase agreement as these deposits are
not due until pre-set intervals prior to scheduled delivery.  The
amendment of the aircraft purchase agreement does not affect the
scheduled delivery of six Airbus A319s in early 2006 that Independence
Air has contracted to purchase from AVSA or the four remaining leased
aircraft to be delivered in April and May 2005.

CRJ Aircraft:

          Independence Air entered into an agreement with Bombardier in
December 2004 to further amend its aircraft purchase agreement in order
to access approximately $38.8 million on deposit with Bombardier for
aircraft orders.  Under the amended agreement, Independence Air applied
the majority of these deposits and progress payments against the
outstanding debt owed to an affiliate of Bombardier on two CRJs delivered
in October 2003 and against other outstanding trade payables owed to
Bombardier and its affiliates.  Independence Air thereafter effected the
sale of the two CRJs and of two other CRJs and one spare CRJ engine, all
of which it owned free and clear of any liens, for approximately $49
million.  Bombardier continues to hold $3.4 million as deposits for
Independence Air's commitment for 34 undelivered CRJs.  Independence
Air's commitments toward these undelivered aircraft continue to be
subject to certain conditions.

					5

          On February 18, 2005, the Company and Independence Air entered
into a series of agreements with GE Commercial Aviation Services, Inc.
and certain of its affiliates ("GECAS") as owner participant under
leveraged leases relating to 24 CRJs, and with the various parties as
loan participant under those leveraged leases, providing for the early
termination of the leases.  These agreements provide for the amendment of
the leases to shorten the term of the leases such that they expire
between February 2005 and July 2005.  The agreements also reduce the rent
between January 1, 2005 and the date of the lease expiration to the
amount of accrued interest on the underlying leveraged lease loans.
Under the agreements, Independence Air will be required to meet certain
amended return conditions and to deliver the aircraft to the lessors by
agreed dates, but upon satisfaction of these obligations will have no
further rent obligations with respect to periods after the amended lease
expiration dates, for these aircraft.  The termination of the 24 leases
will result in a non-cash accounting charge currently estimated at $7.5
million to be taken as the leases are terminated to reverse deferred
credits net of accruals for prepaid rents for these aircraft.  The return
of the 24 CRJs will save approximately $30 million in rent on an annual
basis.

          The Company and Independence Air also entered into an agreement
with GECAS on February 18, 2005 that establishes certain financial
milestones applicable to three-month periods ending in June, September,
October, November and December 2005 and January, February and March 2006
(Milestone Months).  The financial milestones consist of tests of (1) the
Company's unrestricted cash balance and (2) its earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, amortization, and aircraft rents as a percentage of
passenger revenues.  Should the Company fail to satisfy the tests for a
Milestone Month, or fail to provide the information necessary for the
measurement of the milestones, GECAS will have the option, exercisable
within ninety days following the delivery of the financial statements for
such Milestone Month, to terminate the lease for one additional CRJ
aircraft for each Milestone Month, up to a maximum of eight CRJ aircraft.
The terms of the termination of the leases would be similar to those for
the 24 aircraft to be early terminated as described above.

          Independence Air has amended, as of February 18, 2005, the
operative lease or loan agreements for a total of 52 CRJ aircraft that
are financed through leveraged leases or through mortgage loan
financings, to revise the rental and loan payment structure from semi-
annual payments to monthly payments and to defer approximately $70
million of the rent or loan payments that would have been due between
January 2005 and February 2007.  Depending on which operative lease or
loan agreement, interest at a rate of Libor plus 250 basis points or US
Treasury's plus 300 basis points will be charged on the outstanding
deferral balance.  The interest portion of the payments will be paid
monthly beginning January 1, 2005, and the principal portion of the
deferred rent and loan payments will be repaid on a monthly basis
beginning in May 2006.

          In exchange for concessions from CRJ aircraft financing
parties, the Company agreed to issue a total of 2,035,000 additional
shares of FLYi common stock, $0.02 par on February 18, 2005.  The shares
of common stock are to be issued to certain aircraft lessors and lenders
as partial consideration for their agreeing to participate in the
restructuring of the terms of their respective aircraft loans or leases
through the transactions described above.  The number of shares of common
stock issued to each lessor or lender was determined through arms-length
negotiations, and no separate valuation was assigned to the issuance of
the shares.  None of the shares of common stock were issued in exchange
for cash.  The shares were issued in privately negotiated transactions in
reliance upon the exemption from registration provided under Section 4(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933.

					6

J41 Aircraft:

          Independence Air has entered into a series of agreements for
the consensual early termination of leases for 21 of the 30 Jetstream 41
("J41") turboprop aircraft that were previously retired from Independence
Air's active fleet and are not currently used in Independence Air
operations.  The agreements are with the lessors of those aircraft, with
the lenders in the leveraged leases covering three of the aircraft, and
with the manufacturer that provided certain residual support in
connection with the leases.

          BAE Systems (Operations), Limited and its affiliates ("BAE"),
the manufacturer of the J41 aircraft, had provided certain residual value
support to the lessors of 10 of the J41 aircraft that are subject to
early termination agreements.  The Company and Independence Air entered
into an agreement with BAE on February 18, 2005 to resolve certain issues
relating to BAE and to the lessors as a result of the early termination
of the leases, and to resolve any claims which BAE may have against the
Company or Independence Air resulting from the termination of those
leases.  BAE agreed to accept the applicability of its residual value
support agreements to the lessors upon the early termination of the
leases, and agreed that it would not pursue further claims against the
Company or Independence Air relating to those agreements.  The Company
and Independence Air agreed to provide consideration to BAE in exchange,
including a cash payment of $2.0 million and the issuance of a promissory
note of $3.5 million bearing interest at 6.75% payable monthly with
principal repayments beginning in June 2006 and ending in December 2007.
The Company and Independence Air also agreed to issue a non-interest
bearing convertible note in the amount of $5.0 million, convertible into
1 million shares of the Company's stock, and agreed to turn over all of
its remaining J41 spare engines, parts and tooling to BAE during 2005.
The Company and Independence Air also agreed that should BAE elect to
settle any of its residual value agreements by purchasing the aircraft
from the lessors, The Company and Independence Air would relinquish their
claim to any refund of the security deposits for any purchased aircraft.
The amount of the deposits is further described below.

          The agreements with the lessors of the J41 aircraft provide for
the early termination of the leases, the return of the aircraft to the
lessors, and the elimination of future rent obligations.  These
agreements were entered into as of January 14, 2005 for four aircraft and
as of February 18, 2005 for an additional 17 aircraft.  These lease
terminations are expected to reduce Independence Air's net payments
during the period from January 2005 through February 2007 by
approximately $13.5 million net of cash payments made by Independence
Air. Independence Air will be responsible for certain return obligations
with respect to these aircraft, but upon satisfaction of these
obligations will have no further rent obligations with respect to these
aircraft.  Independence Air posted, at the time it initially entered into
the original leases, a total of $3.7 million in security deposits
applicable to the J41 aircraft that are subject to these agreements.
Independence Air has permanently relinquished its claim to $2.2 million
of these deposits and conditionally relinquished its claim to the
remainder of these deposits.  Independence Air is not able to currently
estimate how much, if any, of the remaining $1.5 million of deposits may
be returned to it.  The Company previously recorded an early retirement
charge for the J41 aircraft as they were removed from operation.  The
early retirement charges previously recorded for these aircraft will be
reconciled as the actual costs of the lease terminations are recorded in
2005.

          The Company and Independence Air agreed to provide
consideration to the counterparties for entering into these agreements
including cash payments totaling approximately $3.5 million and the
issuance of interest bearing promissory notes totaling approximately $2.6
million bearing interest at 6.75% payable monthly and with equal payments
of principal and interest monthly from February 2007 through June 2010.
The Company also agreed to issue non-interest bearing convertible notes
in the total amount of $20,952,113, convertible into 3,559,586 shares of
the Company's stock.  Independence Air also agreed to various terms with
respect to the redelivery of the aircraft and in certain cases, to the
condition of the aircraft upon return.

328Jet Aircraft:

          Independence Air had previously disclosed that, as a result of
the termination of its Delta Connection agreement without cause, it had
the right to assign to Delta Air Lines, Inc. ("Delta") leases for 30
Fairchild Dornier 328 regional jet (328Jet) aircraft formerly used in
Delta Connection operations and to require Delta to assume the leases.
In its prior disclosure, the Company indicated that it would continue to
be liable for future obligations under the leases in the event that Delta
at any time did not fulfill those obligations.  Independence Air is
currently in the process of delivering these aircraft to Delta in
connection with the assignment and assumption of the lease obligations.
As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has secured commitments
from lenders in the leveraged leases of these aircraft that, upon Delta's
assumption of the 328Jet leases, the lenders will effectively release the
Company and Independence Air from future obligations to them under the
328Jet leases.  While the owner participant in the leveraged leases, a
bankrupt entity that is in default of its obligations to the lenders and
the Company, has not committed to a release of the Company, the lenders,
which have an assignment of the owner participant's interest in the
leases and have a priority of payment superior to that of the owner
participant, have committed that they will not assert any claims against
the Company with respect to events occurring after assumption by Delta.
The lenders have also agreed that, if Independence Air is required to
make any payments under the leases and the lenders receive any portion of
such payments, they will return those payments to Independence Air.  In
consideration for this arrangement, the Company committed to issue 1.5
million shares of the Company's stock.  Independence Air obtained rent
deferrals similar to those reached on its CRJ fleet for the remaining two
leased 328Jets that are not being assigned to Delta in exchange for the
issuance of 130,000 shares of FLYi common stock and is actively marketing
for sale one unencumbered 328Jet owned by Independence Air.

Other Actions:

          Independence Air entered into a term loan agreement with GECAS
for $16.2 million and borrowed the full amount available under the term
loan.  The loan bears interest at a spread over three month LIBOR based
on an agreed market rate, and is payable in 60 monthly installments
ranging from approximately 1.4% of principal to approximately 2.0% of
principal, with a final maturity on February 18, 2010.  Independence Air
is not permitted to voluntarily prepay the loan for three years and may
do so thereafter only if it provides a letter of credit or other
acceptable security in an amount equal to the payments that are being
deferred under leases of 13 CRJ aircraft.  The loan is secured by
Independence Air's 11 CRJ spare engines and all of its CRJ spare parts.
The loan agreement also provides that the sum of the outstanding amounts
of the loan and lease deferral amounts may not exceed specified
percentages of the appraised values of the collateral.  If these
percentages are exceeded, Independence Air is required to make a partial
prepayment on the loans or provide additional collateral to restore
compliance.  Subject to these requirements, Independence Air is permitted
to dispose of collateral to the extent they become surplus to normal
operations.

          During the fourth quarter of 2004, Independence Air also
initiated and responded to proposals with other carriers to consider
arrangements that would supplement or substitute for its Independence Air
operations with respect to some or all of its operations or aircraft, and
during the first quarter of 2005 it continued to explore whether any such
arrangements might be available on attractive terms.  The Company also
continues to evaluate opportunities to finance the acquisition of
aircraft, engage in other financing transactions, sell additional equity
or debt securities, enter into credit facilities with lenders, or sell
underutilized assets, all for either strategic reasons or to further
strengthen our financial position.

Marketing and Sales

          Independence Air initially adopted the distribution model used
by other low-cost carriers like Southwest and JetBlue that limited ticket
sales to its own web site and call centers.  However, during the fourth
quarter of 2004 Independence Air began to enter into agreements that
would allow it to offer its inventory through the Global Distribution
Systems ("GDSs").  Additional GDSs  were implemented during the first
quarter of 2005, and Independence Air now participates in most of the
major GDSs and a number of online travel sites including Travelocity and
Orbitz.  Participation in the GDSs is supported by Independence Air's
team of Sales professionals who solicit individual corporations and
travel agencies, creating additional interest and incentives for booking
Independence Air flights.

          Although 85% of Independence Air's total bookings are created
online or through the GDSs, the remaining volume is processed through
Independence Air's toll-free reservations phone lines.  Independence Air
maintains a reservations staff at its headquarters facility to monitor
and handle the most complex customer service matters and to solicit and
assist in corporate account bookings.  In addition, Independence Air has
contracted with a number of third party specialists to handle routine
reservations calls at various facilities operated by those parties.

          Independence Air offers a frequent flyer program known as
iCLUB.  Members earn iPOINTs based on the amount of money spent on
Independence Air travel.  iPOINTs are credited when travel is flown and
are good for 12 months.  Awards are posted to an iCLUB account when
thresholds are met within a specified period, and may be redeemed for
roundtrip fares on Independence Air.  The Company accounts for the
estimated cost of its frequent flyer program by accruing a liability for
the estimated incremental cost of providing service to those customers
who will redeem awards.

Fuel

          The Company's finances have been dramatically affected by
record high fuel prices.  Recently, Independence Air has purchased fuel
at a price of $1.65 per gallon.  When Independence Air operations
commenced in June 2004, fuel prices were $1.27 per gallon, and the
original business plan from June 2004 for Independence Air estimated fuel
prices, based on then-prevailing market prices, was at $.90 per gallon.
Independence Air estimates that it will consume approximately 100 million
gallons of jet fuel in 2005.  Independence Air has not hedged fuel costs.

Competition

          The airline industry is highly competitive.  Airline profits
are sensitive to adverse changes in fuel costs, average fare levels and
passenger demand.  Passenger demand and fare levels have historically
been influenced by, among other things, the general state of the economy,
international events, industry capacity and pricing actions taken by
other airlines.  The principal competitive factors in the airline
industry are fare pricing, customer service, routes served, flight
schedules, types of aircraft, safety record and reputation, code-sharing
relationships, in-flight entertainment systems and frequent flyer
programs.

          Recently competition has become even more intense as a result
of the initiatives of low-fare airlines, including Independence Air, to
introduce service to markets that have been traditionally served by
legacy carriers and by the initiatives of the legacy carriers in
response.  The legacy carriers, in some cases operating under the
protection of Federal bankruptcy laws and in the case of US Airways
operating with government provided financing, have reacted by matching
fares, reducing restrictions, offering additional frequent flyer

					9

incentives, increasing advertising, and by taking aggressive steps to
reduce their own costs.  They have also in several instances increased
their capacity in routes served by low-fare carriers.  United, for
example, responded to Independence Air's service introduction by
increasing capacity by 37% in markets served by Independence Air from
Washington Dulles.  In other markets where Independence Air competes, US
Airways, Delta, and Northwest have matched fares, added frequency to
existing markets, and/or started service to markets they previously did
not serve.  The result of this increased intensity in competition has
been a substantial increase in available flight options for the consumer
at substantially reduced prices, which has lead to an increase in overall
passenger traffic but at substantially reduced revenue for the airlines.
The intense competition has also limited the ability of carriers to
adjust pricing to reflect the increased cost of high fuel prices.

          Our competitors and potential competitors include major U.S.
airlines, low-fare airlines, regional airlines and new entrant airlines.
The major airlines are larger, generally have greater financial resources
and serve more routes. They also use advanced technologies, such as
ticketless travel, laptop computers and website bookings.  Our primary
competitors in the non-stop markets that we serve are United, US Airways
and, to a lesser extent, Southwest Airlines, each of which has greater
financial resources and name recognition than we do.  United and US
Airways have also benefited from their operation under bankruptcy court
protection, and US Airways has benefited from government provided
financing.

Seasonality

          The Company's business is highly seasonal in nature with the
winter months being the worst and the spring/summer months being the
best.  As such, the Company's quarterly results may not be indicative of
full year results.

Previous Code-Share Operations

          The Company's prior agreements with United ("UA Agreements")
defined the terms of IA's operation in the United Express program.  IA's
United Express operations accounted for approximately 71% of the
Company's 2004 passenger revenue and 100% of its 2003 passenger revenue
after excluding the discontinued Delta Connection operation.  In November
2000, the Company and United amended and restated the UA Agreements,
effectively changing from a revenue sharing arrangement to a fee-per-
departure arrangement. Under the UA Agreements in effect prior to
December 2000, IA was responsible for, among other things, scheduling,
pricing, and marketing its flights, in coordination with United's
operations, for which it paid United a portion of its revenues. Under the
fee-per-departure arrangement in effect as of December 1, 2000, IA
operated a flight schedule designated by United, for which United paid IA
an agreed amount per departure regardless of the number of passengers
carried, with IA being able to receive additional incentive payments
based on operational performance.  IA thereby assumed the risks
associated with operating the flight schedule and United assumed the risk
of scheduling, marketing, and selling seats to the traveling public.
Pursuant to the restated UA Agreements, United, at its own expense,
provided a number of additional services to IA.  These included
reservations, route planning, scheduling, pricing, revenue management,
revenue accounting, marketing, frequent flyer administration, and the
provision of ticket handling services, customer service, and ground
support services at most of the airports where both companies operate
flights concurrently.

          On December 9, 2002, UAL, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including
United, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States
bankruptcy code. UAL has continued operating and managing its business
and affairs as a debtor in possession. In bankruptcy, United had the
right to assume or reject all executory agreements including the
Company's UA Agreements.  In July, 2003, the Company announced that it

					10

intended to utilize IA's assets to operate as an independent low-fare
airline in the event that United determined to reject the UA Agreements
as a part of United's reorganization in bankruptcy.  On April 5, 2004 the
Company announced it had reached an agreement with United providing for a
transition schedule and exit plan for all IA's United Express aircraft
and related operations as a result of United's decision to reject the UA
Agreements.  That agreement and United's rejection of the UA Agreements
was approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, which oversees United's bankruptcy, on April 16,
2004.  IA subsequently phased out of United Express operations and
operated its last United Express service on August 3, 2004.

          The Company and United reached a settlement on the amounts owed
under the United Express agreement in a settlement agreement approved by
the bankruptcy court on October 15, 2004.  This settlement required
United to pay the Company $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Upon payment by United, the Company and United discharged each other from
any further charges related to the Company's participation in the United
Express program prior to September 30, 2004, the effective date of the
settlement agreement, except that the settlement does not affect the
Company's claim against United for damages from its rejection of the
Company's United Express Agreement.  The effect of the settlement
agreement was recognized in the fourth quarter.  Despite the settlement,
United continues to dispute certain billing matters, with the total
amount remaining in dispute believed to be approximately $0.4 million.

          The Company's Delta Connection Agreement ("DL Agreement")
defined the terms of IA's operation in the Delta Connection program.
Prior to being accounted for as a discontinued operation, IA's Delta
Connection operations accounted for approximately 20% of the Company's
2004 passenger revenue and approximately 17% of its 2003 passenger
revenues.  IA was compensated by Delta on a fee-per-block hour basis at
rates that were reset annually based on anticipated costs in the coming
year.  Under the fee-per-block hour arrangement, IA was contractually
obligated to operate a flight schedule designated by Delta, for which
Delta paid IA an agreed amount per block hour regardless of the number of
passengers carried, with incentive payments based on operational
performance.  IA thereby assumed the risks associated with operating the
flight schedule and Delta assumed the risks of scheduling, marketing, and
selling seats to the traveling public. Pursuant to the DL Agreement,
Delta, at its expense, provided a number of support services to the
Company. These included reservations, customer service, ground handling,
station operations, pricing, scheduling, revenue accounting, revenue
management, frequent flyer administration, marketing, a maintenance
hangar facility in Cincinnati, and other passenger, aircraft and traffic
servicing functions in connection with IA's Delta Connection operation.
On April 6, 2004, the Company announced it had received formal
notification from Delta that Delta will end its fee-per-block hour
agreement with IA by invoking its right under the Delta Connection
Agreement to terminate without cause upon 180 days notice. Subsequently a
transition agreement was entered into with Delta to specify the terms of
the transition, and IA completed its Delta Connection operations on
November 1, 2004.   The Company is treating the termination of the Delta
code share agreement as a discontinued operation and accordingly has
removed the revenues, expenses, and operating statistics attributable to
the Delta Connection operation from all reported operating results
presented in these financial statements and results of operations and is
including these amounts net of income tax as results from discontinued
operations.

Employees

          As of March 1, 2005, the Company and Independence Air had 3,683
full-time and 339 part-time employees, classified as follows:

           Classification               Full-    Part-

           Total employees              3,683      339

						11


          Independence Air's pilots are represented by the Airline Pilots
Association ("ALPA"), flight attendants are represented by the
Association of Flight Attendants-Communications Workers of America ("AFA-
CWA"), and aviation maintenance technicians and ground service equipment
mechanics are represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association
("AMFA").

          In November 2003, the Company and Independence Air finalized an
amended collective bargaining agreement with ALPA on pay reductions and
work rule changes that were contingent on signing a purchase agreement
with an aircraft manufacture for delivery of twenty-five narrow body
aircraft.  The agreement extended the term of the collective bargaining
agreement such that it will next be amendable as of December 31, 2007,
and established pay rates and work-rules for pilots operating narrow-body
jets that the Company believes are competitive with other low-fare
carriers. The new agreement also included terms designed to decrease
costs and increase productivity for operating its regional jets including
a reduction in CRJ rates that took effect in June 2004.

          Independence Air's collective bargaining agreement with the AFA-
CWA, which was ratified in October 1998, became amendable in October
2002.  Independence Air and AFA-CWA reached a Tentative Agreement on
February 10, 2005.  A vote on the Tentative Agreement will be completed
on March 21st, 2005. If ratified by the Flight Attendants the new
agreement will be amendable July 31, 2007.  The agreement is designed to
address quality of life issues that were of concern to the work group and
to update work rules of interest to the parties.  If adopted, the
agreement would provide for the first pay rate increase to be effective
in August 2006.

          Independence Air's collective bargaining agreement with AMFA,
which was ratified in June 1998, became amendable in June 2002.
Independence Air has been in mediated negotiations with AMFA during
2004.  The Mediator recessed negotiations in October 2004 and
Independence Air and AMFA have not met in formal negotiations since.
Independence Air is unable to predict when meetings will resume, but does
not anticipate that any issues relating to these negotiations will have a
material effect on Independence Air's operations for the foreseeable
future.

          In the airline industry, labor relations are regulated by the
Railway Labor Act ("RLA").  Under the RLA, collective bargaining
agreements do not expire but, rather, become amendable.  The wage rates,
benefits and work rules contained in a contract that has become amendable
remain in place and represent the status quo until a successor agreement
is in place.  The parties may not resort to self-help, such as strikes or
lockouts, until the RLA processes for collective bargaining have been
exhausted.  It is impossible to predict how long the RLA processes will
take.

          Independence Air's other work groups are not unionized.
Independence Air believes that certain of its unrepresented labor groups
are from time to time approached by unions seeking to represent them.
However, Independence Air has not received any official notice of
organizing activity and there have been no representation applications
filed with the National Mediation Board by any of these groups.
Independence Air believes that the wage rates and benefits for non-union
employee groups are comparable to similar groups at other similarly
situated airlines.

					12

Pilot Training

          Independence Air conducts its CRJ pilot training through a
training program managed internally, conducted by in-house instructors,
and utilizing simulators operated by a third party.  Independence Air has
entered into agreements with Pan Am International Flight Academy
("PAIFA") for CRJ simulator usage at PAIFA's facility near Washington
Dulles.  This facility currently houses three CRJ simulators, and
Independence Air believes that these facilities will be adequate to
support its training requirements.  The agreements require Independence
Air to purchase an annual minimum number of CRJ simulator training hours
at agreed rates through 2010.  Independence Air's payment obligations for
CRJ simulator usage over the remaining years of the agreements total
approximately $6.8 million.  Independence Air has restructured its
agreements with PAIFA to reduce its simulator costs for 2005.

          Independence Air conducts its Airbus training through a
training program provided by Airbus.  The training is to be provided by
Airbus and certain rates have been agreed as part of the Airbus
acquisition agreement.  Independence Air is also free to purchase
training from alternative sources.  Independence Air believes that
adequate training services, including simulator time in North America,
will be available from Airbus to fulfill its training requirements for
the foreseeable future.  Independence Air is utilizing manufacturer
credits issued in lieu of payment for a portion of its initial training
requirements.  When these credits are fully utilized it will need to pay
cash for subsequent training.  In addition to the usage of the
manufacturer's training program, Independence Air may conduct a limited
amount of training using its own training program and instructors, and
will consider development of an in-house training program for A319s
pilots in the future.

Industry Regulation and Airport Access

          Economic.  The Department of Transportation ("DOT") has
extensive authority to issue certificates authorizing carriers to engage
in air transportation, establish consumer protection regulations,
prohibit certain unfair or anti-competitive practices, mandate certain
conditions of carriage and make ongoing determinations of a carrier's
fitness, willingness and ability to provide air transportation.  The DOT
can bring proceedings for the enforcement of its regulations under
applicable federal statutes, which proceedings may result in civil
penalties, revocation of operating authority or criminal sanctions.

          The Company's Independence Air subsidiary holds a certificate
of public convenience and necessity, issued by the DOT, which authorizes
it to conduct scheduled and charter air transportation of persons,
property and mail between all points in the United States, its
territories and possessions with regional jet and narrow-body equipment.
In addition, Independence Air may conduct scheduled and charter air
transportation with regional jet aircraft to points outside the United
States, subject to obtaining any necessary authority from any foreign
country to be so served.  Were Independence Air to operate its narrow-
body aircraft outside of the United States, additional DOT authority
would be required to conduct such air transportation.  Independence Air's
certificate requires that Independence Air maintain DOT-prescribed
minimum levels of insurance, comply with all applicable statutes and
regulations and remain continuously "fit" to engage in air
transportation.  Based on conditions in the industry, or as a result of
Congressional directives or statutes, the DOT from time to time proposes
and adopts new regulations or amends existing regulations that may impose
additional regulatory burdens and costs on Independence Air.  Imposition
of new laws and regulations on air carriers could increase the cost of
operation and or limit carrier management discretion.

					13

          Safety.  The FAA extensively regulates the safety-related
activities of air carriers.  Independence Air is subject to the FAA's
jurisdiction with respect to aircraft maintenance and operations,
equipment, ground facilities, flight dispatch, communications, training,
weather observation, flight personnel, the transportation of hazardous
materials and other matters affecting air safety.  To ensure compliance
with its regulations, the FAA requires commercial airlines under its
jurisdiction to obtain an operating certificate and operations
specifications for the particular aircraft and types of operations
conducted by such airlines.  The Company's Independence Air subsidiary
possesses an operating certificate and related authorities issued by the
FAA authorizing it to conduct operations with turboprop, regional jet and
narrow-body equipment.  Independence Air's authority to conduct
operations is subject to suspension, modification or revocation for
cause.  The FAA has authority to bring proceedings to enforce its
regulations, which proceedings may result in civil penalties, which can
be substantial, criminal penalties, or suspension or revocation of
operating authority.

          From time to the time and with varying degrees of intensity,
the FAA conducts inspections of air carriers.  Such inspections may be
scheduled or unscheduled and may be triggered by specific events
involving either the specific carrier being inspected or other air
carriers.  In addition, the FAA may require airlines to demonstrate that
they have the capacity to properly manage growth and safely operate
increasing numbers of aircraft.

          In order to ensure the highest level of safety in air
transportation, the FAA has authority to issue maintenance directives and
other mandatory orders.  These relate to, among other things, the
inspection of aircraft and the mandatory removal and replacement of parts
or structures.  In addition, the FAA from time to time amends its
regulations and such amended regulations may impose additional regulatory
burdens on Independence Air, such as the required installation of new
safety-related items.  Depending upon the scope of the FAA's orders and
amended regulations, these requirements may cause Independence Air to
incur substantial, unanticipated expenses.

          On November 19, 2001 the President signed into law the Aviation
and Transportation Security Act (the "Security Act").  The Security Act
requires heightened passenger, baggage and cargo security measures to be
adopted as well as enhanced airport security procedures.  The Security
Act created the Transportation Security Administration ("TSA") that has
taken over the responsibility for conducting the screening of passengers
and their baggage at the nation's airports as of February 17, 2002.  The
activities of the TSA are funded in part by the application of a $2.50
per passenger enplanement security fee (subject to a maximum of $5.00 per
one way trip) and payment by all passenger carriers of a sum not
exceeding each carrier's passenger and baggage screening cost incurred in
calendar year 2000.  In the Administration's fiscal year 2006 budget it
has proposed to authorize TSA to collect an additional $3.00 per
passenger segment security fee, or $5.50 per segment and a maximum of
$8.00 per one-way trip.  If Congress accepts the Administration's
proposal, Independence Air will have to collect these additional fees
from its passengers, thereby making the cost of air transportation more
expensive which, in turn, may dampen demand for the services of
Independence Air.  In addition, competitive pressures in the industry may
preclude Independence Air from being able to pass on the added fee such
that the fee may further diminish Independence Air's air transportation
revenues.

          The Security Act imposes new and increased requirements for air
carrier employee background checks and additional security training of
flight and cabin crew personnel.  These additional and new requirements
have increased the security related costs of Independence Air.  The
Security Act also mandates and the FAA has adopted new rules requiring
the strengthening of cockpit doors, some of the costs of which have been
reimbursed by the FAA.  Independence Air has completed all mandatory
cockpit door modifications and has been reimbursed $2.7 million under the
Security Act, although the cost of such modifications exceeded this
amount.  At times when the aviation security threat level is elevated by
the Department of Homeland Security, Independence Air may experience
security-related disruptions, including reduced passenger demand,
resulting from enhanced passenger screening at airports and possible
flight cancellations. Independence Air believes that its exposure to such
disruptions is no greater than that faced by other providers of regional
air carrier services.

					14

          Although the TSA has taken over the former responsibilities of
the air carriers for the screening of all passengers and baggage, the
TSA, as with the FAA before it, requires air carriers to adopt and
enforce procedures designed to safeguard property, and to protect airport
and aircraft against terrorist acts.  The TSA, from time to time, may
impose additional security requirements on air carriers and airport
authorities based on specific threats or world conditions or as otherwise
required.  The TSA has issued a number of security directives and altered
procedures upon changes in the Office of Homeland Security announcements
of heightened threat levels, and Independence Air has adjusted its
security procedures on numerous occasions in response to these
directives.  Independence Air incurred substantial expense in complying
with current security requirements and it cannot predict what additional
security requirements may be imposed in the future or the cost of
complying with such requirements.

          Associated with the FAA's security responsibility is its
program to ensure compliance with rules regulating the transportation of
hazardous materials.  Independence Air has policies against accepting
hazardous materials or other dangerous goods for transportation.
Employees of Independence Air are trained in the recognition of hazardous
materials and dangerous goods through an FAA approved training course.
Independence Air may ship aircraft and other parts and equipment, some of
which may be classified as hazardous materials, using the services of
third party carriers, both ground and air.  In acting in the capacity of
a shipper of hazardous materials, Independence Air must comply with
applicable regulations.  The FAA enforces its hazardous material
regulations by the imposition of civil penalties, which can be
substantial.

          Other Regulation.  In the maintenance of its aircraft fleet and
ground equipment, Independence Air handles and uses many materials that
are classified as hazardous.  The Environmental Protection Agency and
similar local agencies have jurisdiction over the handling and processing
of these materials.  Independence Air is also subject to the oversight of
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration concerning employee
safety and health matters.  Independence Air is subject to the Federal
Communications Commission's jurisdiction regarding the use of radio
frequencies.

          Federal law establishes maximum aircraft noise and emissions
limits.  At the present time, all of the aircraft operated by
Independence Air comply with all applicable federal noise and emissions
regulations.  Federal law generally preempts airports from imposing
unreasonable local noise rules that restrict air carrier operations.
However, under certain circumstances airport operators may implement
reasonable and nondiscriminatory local noise abatement procedures, which
could impact the ability of Independence Air to serve certain airports,
particularly in off-peak hours.

          Slots.  Slots are reservations for takeoffs and landings at
specified times and are required by governmental authorities to operate
at certain airports within the United States.  Independence Air has
rights to and utilizes takeoff and landing slots at New York-Kennedy, and
White Plains, New York airports.  Airlines may acquire slots by
governmental grant, by lease or purchase from other airlines, or by loan
when another airline does not use a slot but desires to avoid
governmental reallocation of a slot for lack of use.  All leased and
loaned slots are subject to renewal and termination provisions.  Under
law presently in effect, slot regulation at  Kennedy airport is scheduled
to end after January 1, 2007.  The rules also provide that, in addition
to those slots currently held by carriers, operators of regional jet
aircraft and new entrant air carriers may apply for, and the Secretary of
Transportation must grant, additional slots at New York-Kennedy in order
to permit the carriers to offer new service, increase existing service or
upgrade to regional jet service in qualifying smaller communities.  There
is no limit on the number of slots a carrier may request.  Prior to the

					15

commencement of services by Independence Air, Independence Air requested
and obtained from the FAA, under the provisions of current law, slots
necessary to operate its flight schedule to and from New York Kennedy
Airport.  The New York Kennedy Airport slots are permanent, subject to
loss due to nonuse.  To the extent Independence Air would seek to operate
narrow-body aircraft at Kennedy or any other slot controlled airport, it
will have to either purchase or lease slots from another air carrier or
be qualified to obtain such slots under the then current regulatory
regime.  Slots at White Plains, New York airport are held in the name of
Independence Air and are sufficient to conduct operations at the airport.
As a result of congestion at Chicago O'Hare Airport on January 21, 2004
the FAA entered an Order requiring the two largest O'Hare carriers,
United Airlines and American Airlines, to reduce their O'Hare flight
schedules, including the schedules operated by carriers affiliated with
these major carriers.  The FAA order was subsequently extended until
October 2004. Prior to its expiration, the FAA on August 18, 2004 issued
another order setting limits through April 30. 2005 on the number of air
carrier arrivals at O'Hare during peak hours to reduce the level of
airport congestion and applied the terms of the order to all domestic
carriers operating at O'Hare, including Independence Air.  The FAA has
proposed to extend the effectiveness of this order until October 30, 2005
during which time the FAA has indicated that it intends to propose and
adopt a longer term, more permanent solution to the issue of O'Hare
airport delays.  At the current time Independence Air has sufficient
rights to conduct flights at O'Hare during the controlled hours.  Should
the FAA propose additional limits on Independence Air flight arrivals, it
may not be able to develop a flight schedule that maximizes Independence
Air's revenue opportunities.

Risk Factors Affecting the Company

          The Company's business is subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties, as described below and in the section titled,
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk".

Risk Factors Affecting the Company Relating to Independence Air


We face pressure to increase operating revenues and reduce operating
costs to avoid a liquidity crisis

          The fierce competition and weak revenue environment that
Independence Air operations have encountered, combined with lower than
expected passenger traffic and unprecedented high jet fuel prices have
resulted in Independence Air's revenue falling significantly below
anticipated levels and the Company expending cash at an unsustainable
rate.  Although we have implemented cost savings measures, we may not be
able to reduce our operating costs enough to offset the revenue
shortfall.

          We expect to have substantial cash needs as we continue to
establish ourselves under the new brand "Independence Air" as a low-fare
carrier, including cash required to fund increases in accounts payable,
prepaid expenses, aircraft security deposits on new aircraft to be
leased, pre-delivery payments on new aircraft to be purchased, as well as
anticipated operating losses.  As of December 31, 2004, our debt of
$238.8 million exceeded our total capitalization. In addition to long-
term debt, we have a significant amount of other fixed obligations under
operating leases related to our aircraft, airport terminal space, other
airport facilities and office space. As of December 31, 2004, future
minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial
or remaining terms in excess of one year were approximately $1.7 billion
for 2005 through 2024, not including commitments for the remaining Airbus
A319 aircraft we intend to acquire.

          Future operating lease commitments for the eight leased Airbus
aircraft undelivered at December 31, 2004 are expected to be
approximately $325 million, and our purchase commitment for 16 additional
Airbus aircraft is expected to be approximately $560 million over the
next three years, including estimated amounts for contractual price
escalations. We will continue to incur additional debt and other fixed
obligations as we take delivery of new aircraft and other parts and
equipment and continue to expand into new markets. The leases for the
Airbus aircraft require security deposits to be held by the lessors in
addition to payments of monthly rent and maintenance reserves. The
purchase agreement for the Airbus aircraft requires progress payments to
be made for each aircraft as the delivery date approaches. We have
historically funded the majority of our aircraft acquisitions by entering
into off-balance sheet financing arrangements known as leveraged leases,
in which third parties provide equity and debt financing to purchase the
aircraft and simultaneously enter into long-term agreements to lease the
aircraft to us.  However, we do not anticipate that this source of

					16

financing will be available to us for the foreseeable future, and that we
will need to finance our aircraft through secured debt or operating
leases.  We are exposed to interest rate risks that can affect our costs
under any of these financing techniques.  There can be no assurance that
we will be able to secure lease and/or debt financing on terms acceptable
to us or at all.

          Our outstanding indebtedness and significant fixed obligations,
and our lack of a history of profitability for Independence Air
operations, could have important consequences. For example, they could:

     . adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing to
     support our planned growth and for working capital and other general
     corporate purposes;

     . divert substantial cash flow from our operations and expansion plans
     in order to service our fixed obligations or to place deposits or
     collateral to secure financing;

     . require us to incur significantly more interest or rent expense than
     we currently do; and

     . place us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less
     leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital
     resources.

          We have no lines of credit, other than letters of credit
collateralized by cash, and we will continue to rely on our existing cash
balances, cash flow from operations and other sources of capital to
satisfy our obligations.  In connection with our recently completed
financial restructuring, we pledged substantially all of our remaining
unencumbered collateral.  Even with the recent completion of our
financial restructuring, if passenger traffic or yield do not achieve
anticipated levels, fuel costs continue at current high levels or other
events affect its operations,the Company may again face liquidity concerns.
If the Company is not able to achieve its current business plan, cash
balances and cash flow from operations together with operating lease financing
and other available equipment financing may not be sufficient to enable the
Company to meet its working capital needs, expected operating lease financing
commitments, other capital expenditures, and debt service requirements as they
come due for the remainder of 2005 and into 2006. If we are unable to make
payments on our debt and other fixed obligations as they come due, we could
be forced to consider commencing a bankruptcy case under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or may be the subject of an involuntary Chapter 11 case
commenced against us by creditors.

Because we have limited operating history as a low-fare carrier, it is
difficult to evaluate our ability to succeed in this business

          Although we have operated as an airline since 1992, our past
results offer little meaningful guidance with respect to our future
performance because prior to June 16, 2004 we had not operated as an
independent carrier. In addition, we have not had responsibility for
route planning, scheduling, pricing, marketing, advertising, sales,
revenue management or revenue accounting functions since December 2000,
and for the first time we are operating our own distribution,
reservations and ticketing functions. Also, while previous operations
have been under the United and Delta brands, Independence Air is a new
brand, and has limited market recognition. As a result, because we have
only recently begun to operate as an independent, low-fare carrier, it is
difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our future performance will
depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:

					17

       .  Further develop our Independence Air brand and product to make it
       attractive to our target customers;

       .  implement our business strategy by placing into service additional
       A319 aircraft into new and longer-haul markets than we have previously
       served;

       .  successfully choose new A319 markets and service levels, and
       successfully choose the markets and service levels to be operated by our
       reduced CRJ fleet;

       .  reduce our expenses to adjust to the current revenue and fuel cost
       environment, and to reflect a reduced number of aircraft in operation;

       .  secure favorable terms with airports, suppliers and other
       contractors;

       .  monitor and manage major operational and financial risks;

       .  return a significant number of aircraft to their lessors during
       2005, without incurring unexpected costs or disruption of ongoing
       operations;

       .  obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals, including
       airport "slots" where necessary;

       .  attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel;

       .  finance the necessary capital investments including future aircraft
       deliveries;

       .  maintain the safety and security of our operations; and

       .  react to responses from our competitors, including both legacy and
       low-fare airlines.

There can be no assurances that we will successfully address any of these
factors, and our failure to do so could harm our business.

Our recently completed financial restructuring may result in significant
expenditures and limits the flexibility of our operations

          As discussed above under "Item 1. Business - Financial
Restructuring," in connection with our recently completed financial
restructuring we have entered into agreements that require us to satisfy
certain obligations.  We may have to incur unexpected costs to satisfy
certain of these obligations, and our failure to satisfy these or other
obligations arising under our financial restructuring could limit the
flexibility of our operations.  We have reached agreements with the
lessors for 24 of Independence Air's CRJs and, as stated above, with the
lessors for 21 of the J-41 turboprops that were formerly used in our
United Express operations for the return of the aircraft to the lessors
and the elimination of our future rent obligations.  The terms of those
agreements include certain obligations with respect to the return of the
aircraft, including physical condition and timing of the return.  We may
incur unexpected charges arising from those obligations and/or may fail
to satisfy all of those obligations as to some or all of the aircraft.
We have also agreed to permit the lessor to require us to return up to
eight additional CRJ aircraft if we do not meet certain financial
milestones.  The removal of these aircraft could result in additional
costs, and could be harmful to the business plan if we are forced to
remove aircraft that are providing a positive contribution to our

					18

performance. The restructuring of the lease and loan payments on 52 CRJs
defers the payment of approximately $70 million that would have been due
between January 2005 and February 2007 and converts the previous semi-
annual payment dates to monthly payment dates.  The $70 million of
deferrals and associated interest will be repaid monthly over the
remaining term of the financing beginning in May 2006.

We are under pressure to control and reduce our costs

          The extensive competition, high fuel costs, excess capacity and
success of low-fare carriers has resulted in increased emphasis in the
airline industry on controlling and reducing expenses. Many of our
competitors are effecting cost reductions that will increase their
ability to compete against Independence Air.  In this environment, if we
are unable to align our costs with our business plan or to control and
reduce our costs in general, we may not be able to effectively compete
against other regional carriers flying for legacy carriers or other low-
fare carriers to maintain or expand our existing operations and carry out
our business plan.

We are subject to risks arising from fuel costs and availability of fuel

          Like all airlines, our finances have been dramatically affected
by record high fuel prices.  Recently we have purchased fuel at a price
of $1.65 per gallon.  When we first started Independence Air operations
in June 2004 we were purchasing fuel at $1.27 per gallon.  With about 100
million gallons projected to be consumed in 2005, at today's rates we
would incur approximately $38.1 million in additional cost for 2005
compared to what that fuel would have cost at prices that were prevailing
when we first started operations.  We have not hedged our fuel needs.  We
cannot predict the future cost and availability of fuel. Both fuel costs
and availability are subject to many economic and political factors and
events occurring throughout the world over which we have no control. Fuel
availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage
and is affected by demand for both home heating oil and gasoline.
Because of the intense pricing competition, the ability of carriers to
adjust pricing to reflect higher fuel costs has been limited.  We do not
believe that this present situation is sustainable either for us or for
the industry as a whole, and that without either a reduction in fuel
prices or an increase in ticket prices, we, like many other airlines, may
not be successful.

          We rely on third parties and supply infrastructure to provide
sufficient fuel for our operations. The inability of these third parties
to perform, the interruption of fuel supplies at an airport, or the
inability to deliver sufficient fuel to us due to infrastructure
constraints could result in cancelled flights and/or higher fuel prices.

We have costs and possible exposure arising from the Fairchild Dornier
328 regional jet ("328Jet") and termination of our Delta Connection
operations

          In April 2002, Fairchild Dornier GmbH ("Fairchild"), the
manufacturer of the 32-seat 328Jet, was placed under the supervision of a
court-appointed interim trustee and in July 2002 Fairchild opened formal
insolvency proceedings in Germany.  The lack of manufacturer product
support, along with a high level of unscheduled maintenance events for
the engines that power the aircraft, resulted in an increase in the cost
to operate the 328Jet aircraft type and a decrease in the aircraft's
value.  Following Delta's notice that it would terminate the Delta
Agreement without cause upon 180 days notice, we notified Delta that we
were exercising our right under the terms of the Delta Agreement to
require Delta to assume the leases on 30 of the 33 328Jets used in the
Delta program.  We have entered into agreements with the loan
participants of those leveraged leases to relieve us of further
obligations to them under the leases provided we can complete the
assignment to Delta within a specified period of time.  We do not have

					19

such an agreement with the equity participant in such aircraft although
we believe that other circumstances relating to the structure of the
leases and to certain defaults to us by that party effectively insulates
us from further liability.  We are anticipating completing the assignment
to Delta in March 2005 but there can be no assurance that the assignments
will be successfully completed.  We are currently working with Delta and
their representatives to complete inspections and records review for each
aircraft. These detailed inspections of each aircraft and its related
records have caused the Company additional expense and time not originally
planned.  The delay in assigning the aircraft to Delta required the
Company to make the semi annual lease payment due on these aircraft. Delta
is currently repaying these rents on a weekly basis and is obligated to
make up any unamortized amounts upon assignment of the aircraft. Until the
assignments to Delta are complete, the Company is at risk of not
recovering the semi-annual rents it has already paid and remains
liable for the full lease term in the case Delta were to default on its
obligations.  We also are responsible for the remarketing of the two
leased 328Jet aircraft that we do not have a right to require Delta to
assume, as well as the spare parts inventory, tooling and ground equipment
unique to the 328Jet. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
redeploy in a profitable manner these two leased 328Jets. We recorded
impairment charges of $13.8 million in connection with our one owned
328Jet and 328Jet spare parts, early retirement charges of $7.2 million
in connection with the two leased 328Jets that we do not have the right to
require Delta to assume and may incur additional one-time costs in
connection with the termination of the Delta relationship.

We will incur cash charges and may incur other unexpected charges as we
return the J-41 aircraft to the lessors

          We have retired all J-41 type aircraft from our fleet.  As part
of our recently completed financial restructuring, we have reached
agreement with the lessors for 21 of those aircraft on the terms for the
return of the aircraft to the lessors and the elimination of our future
rent obligations.  The terms of those agreements include certain
obligations with respect to the return of the aircraft, including in some
cases physical condition, the production of certain records, and timing
of the returns.  We may incur unexpected charges arising from those
obligations and/or may fail to satisfy all of those obligations as to
some or all of the aircraft.  For the remaining nine J41 aircraft we are
still contractually required to continue to make payments under the
lease/loan agreements for the aircraft, and do not expect to be able to
obtain any significant amount of sublease income relative to our rent
obligations.


Our expansion of Independence Air requires significant new
infrastructures

          Our business strategy involves successfully establishing
Washington Dulles as the hub for a new low-fare airline, establishing the
Independence Air brand in regional jet markets we have been serving to
and from Washington Dulles, expanding our operation into certain markets
not previously served, and creating flight connection opportunities. We
must continue to establish and maintain significant new infrastructures
that are necessary to operate as an independent airline, including
scheduling, market planning and marketing, advertising, ground operations
and information systems. Achieving our business strategy is critical in
order for our business to create passenger connecting opportunities for
markets to be served with our existing fleet of CRJs and with the Airbus
A319 aircraft that we currently operate and are acquiring, and to achieve
economies of scale, both of which are critical to profitable operations.
Increasing the number of markets we serve depends on our ability to
successfully introduce the Airbus aircraft into our fleet, and to secure
suitable slots, gates, ticket counter positions and other facilities at
airports located in our targeted geographic markets.  In some of our
markets we must establish and maintain ground operations and in some
markets we compete with United and others for facilities and employees.
Opening new markets requires us to commit a substantial amount of
resources, even before new service commences. Expansion also requires
additional skilled personnel and equipment.  An inability to hire and
retain skilled personnel or to secure the required equipment and
facilities efficiently and cost-effectively or to successfully develop
and implement other necessary systems may affect our ability to achieve
our business strategy.  In addition, Independence Air operations may also

					20

increase the demands on management and our operating systems and internal
controls beyond levels we currently anticipate. Such expansion may strain
our existing management resources and operational, financial and
management information systems to the point that they may no longer be
adequate to support our operations, requiring us to make larger
expenditures in these areas than we currently anticipate.  There can be
no assurance that we will be able to develop these controls, systems or
procedures on a timely or cost-effective basis, and the failure to do so
could harm our business.

Failure to successfully implement our strategy for Independence Air could
harm our business

          Our business strategy for Independence Air involves, among
others, attractive schedule and connection opportunities to the markets
we serve, aggressive management of unit costs, and offering fares that
are significantly lower than existed prior to our entry in order to
stimulate demand.  While we have found that our new fare structure has in
fact stimulated passenger growth, our competitors' response in
aggressively matching our fares and increasing capacity on many of our
markets has resulted in an overcapacity of seats relative to the
increased passenger growth.  There can be no assurance that we will be
able to sufficiently balance our costs with the demand for our product,
and failure to do so may prevent us from successfully implementing our
strategy for Independence Air.

Our maintenance costs will increase as our regional jet fleet ages and as
certain aircraft are returned to the lessors and retired from our fleet

          As our fleet of regional jet aircraft ages, the maintenance
costs for such aircraft will likely increase.  In addition, the CRJs
being returned to lessors under our recently completed financial
restructuring are generally among our newer aircraft, and thus have
operated at lower costs than our average fleet.  Although we cannot
accurately predict how much our maintenance costs will increase in the
future, they may increase significantly. Any such increase could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. We are vulnerable to any problems associated with the
aircraft in our fleet, including design defects, mechanical problems or
adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance
or an inability to operate our aircraft.

Our business plan for Independence Air is heavily dependent on the
metropolitan Washington, D.C. market, including Northern Virginia, and a
reduction in demand for air travel in this market or the inability of
Washington Dulles to accommodate our operations would harm our business

          Our operations focus on flights to and from our primary base of
operations at Washington Dulles.  As a result, we are highly dependent
upon the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia markets. Our business
would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for
air transportation in the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia
metropolitan area, such as adverse changes in local economic conditions,
political disruptions or violence (including any terrorist attacks),
negative public perception of the city or region, significant price
increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on
passengers or the impact of past or future terrorist attacks.  Likewise,
our business could be harmed by any disruption of service or facilities
at Washington Dulles.

We face competition as a low-fare airline from legacy carriers as well as
low-fare airlines to which we have not been previously exposed

          The airline industry is highly competitive, primarily due to
the effects of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, which substantially
eliminated government authority to regulate domestic routes and fares,

					21

and increased the ability of airlines to compete with respect to
destination flight frequencies and fares. Independence Air operates in a
new sector of the airline industry that is highly competitive and is
particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines typically
incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying
otherwise unsold seats. Our competition includes legacy carriers and low-
fare carriers, which are aggressively responding to our new Independence
Air service to protect their markets and expand into new ones by adding
service in markets we serve or plan to serve, reducing fares to these
markets and/or providing frequent flyer and other incentives.  The
competitive response has included not only flights to and from Washington
Dulles, Reagan National and BWI airports, but has also included
origination and destination markets that we connect through Washington
Dulles.  Several legacy carriers, including United and Delta, have
introduced low-fare carriers to their operations.  In addition, because
of the nature of our past relationship with United and because we offer
service between key United hubs, United's response to our operation as
Independence Air has been and is expected to continue to be highly
competitive and unpredictable.  Independence Air also competes against
established brands used by both legacy carriers and low-fare carriers
that carry greater name recognition, both at Washington Dulles and at the
other cities that we serve.  Both legacy carriers and low-fare carriers
also continue to take delivery of regional jets, and we may face
increased competition from regional jets at Washington Dulles, including
the use of new 70 or 90 seat regional jets, which would be larger than
those we currently have in our regional jet fleet.  The use of new,
larger scale regional jets will allow competitors to serve markets
smaller than can now be served by low-fare carriers using larger
aircraft, with a seat mile cost that may be lower than ours.

          Our base of operations for Independence Air is Washington
Dulles, which is served by a number of larger airlines that have greater
name recognition and greater resources than we do.  These larger airlines
have and may in the future commence or increase their capacity and
service at Washington Dulles because there are currently no rules
restricting access at this airport.  We are competing in markets at fares
offered by airlines at other airports that currently serve the
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including Reagan National Airport and
Baltimore Washington International Airport. We may also face competition
from other airlines that may begin serving any of the markets we serve
and from ground transportation alternatives. Other airlines with greater
financial resources than ours also have or may in the future meet or
price their fares below our fares or introduce new nonstop service
between cities served by our flights to and from Washington Dulles,
Reagan National Airport or Baltimore Washington International Airport and
prevent us from attaining a share of the passenger traffic necessary to
operate profitably. We expect that competition will exist in all the
direct markets that we currently serve and will serve in the future, as
well as in the market for flights that connect through Washington Dulles.
We further expect that the competition for passengers connecting through
Washington Dulles will be both from airlines offering service through
Washington Dulles and from the large number of alternative hubs
throughout the U.S., instead of Washington Dulles, through which
connecting passengers can elect to route their travel.

          Our new West Coast services marks our entry into the highly
competitive transcontinental market.  Transcontinental routes were priced
aggressively by low-fare carriers prior to our entry, and our offering of
these routes poses a direct threat to legacy carriers on routes that we
believe have traditionally been more profitable for them.  We have
already seen substantial fare-cutting by United and other legacy carriers
on our new West Coast routes and anticipate a continued strong
competitive response to our service.

Our business model is dependent on our ability to continue to take
delivery of, place into service and integrate new Airbus A319 aircraft
into our operations

          As of March 14, 2005 we were operating eight Airbus A319
aircraft and have 20 additional Airbus single aisle aircraft on order.
The Airbus A319 aircraft will operate in markets that are important to

					22

serving a broad selection of cities from Washington Dulles, and providing
that service is critical to attracting customers to our airline.  The
A319 aircraft also will allow us to connect passengers to and from
markets served by the regional jets to additional long haul markets, and
we will thus rely on the Airbus A319 aircraft to generate incremental
revenues for the regional jet fleet.

          If we, Airbus or the aircraft lessors are unable or unwilling
to satisfy contractual obligations relating to the aircraft, we would be
required to obtain alternative aircraft.  A number of factors could limit
or preclude our ability to obtain the aircraft from Airbus, including:

         Airbus, the aircraft lessors or we could refuse, or not be
       financially able, to perform important obligations as set forth in the
       final agreement; and

         Airbus could experience a disruption to its operations that affects
       its ability to complete or timely fulfill its obligations.

          Our ability to execute our business plan could be materially
impaired if we were required to order alternate aircraft, or if the
delivery schedule for the Airbus aircraft were delayed for any meaningful
period.

          Acquisition of an all-new type of aircraft, such as the Airbus
A319 aircraft, involves a variety of risks relating to our ability to
successfully place those aircraft into service, including:

      delays in meeting the agreed upon aircraft delivery schedule;

      difficulties in obtaining financing on acceptable terms to complete
     our purchase or lease of all of the firm ordered aircraft;

      inability of the aircraft and all of its components to comply with
     agreed upon specifications and performance standards; and

      inability to successfully complete the required training of flight
     crews and maintenance staff.

          We have limited experience operating and maintaining the Airbus
A319 aircraft, and we therefore face risks in continuing to integrate the
aircraft into our existing infrastructure and operations, including among
other things, the additional costs, resources and time needed to hire
and/or train new or existing pilots, technicians and other skilled
support personnel. Our failure to successfully take delivery of, place
into service and integrate into our operations all of the new Airbus
single aisle aircraft could harm our business.

          In the event that our Airbus aircraft are removed from
scheduled service for repairs or other reasons (other than routine
maintenance), we could experience a disruption in our scheduled service
that would have an adverse effect on our operations. Similarly, our
operations could also be harmed by the failure or inability of Airbus to
provide sufficient parts or related support services on a timely basis.

We rely on maintaining a high daily aircraft utilization rate of our
Airbus to keep our costs low, which makes us especially vulnerable to
delays

          One of the key elements of the Independence Air business
strategy is to maintain a high daily aircraft utilization rate of our

					23

A319 aircraft, which is the amount of time that our aircraft spend in the
air carrying passengers. High daily aircraft utilization allows us to
generate more revenue from our aircraft and is achieved in part by
reducing turnaround times at airports so we can fly more hours on average
in a day.  Aircraft utilization is reduced by delays from various
factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others,
air traffic and airport congestion, inclement weather, security
requirements, crew availability, fueling and ground handling and
unscheduled maintenance.  Because many of our A319 routes will be to
distant markets that will be remote from our hub, we may have a
difficulty in recovering from irregular operations.  Furthermore, a
schedule that contemplates high aircraft utilization is subject to the
increased risk that once an aircraft falls behind schedule during the
day, it could remain behind schedule during the remainder of that day and
potentially into the next day, which can result in disruption in
operating performance leading to passenger dissatisfaction and missed
connections. All of the foregoing delays may increase our costs as well
as diminish our reputation among our customers.

We do not participate in the types of marketing alliances used by many of
our competitors

          Many airlines have marketing alliances with other airlines
under which they market and advertise their status as marketing alliance
partners.  Among other things, they share the use of flight designator
codes to identify their flights and fares in the computerized reservation
systems and permit reciprocity in their frequent flyer programs.  In
recent years, alliance activity among major carriers has significantly
expanded within the airline industry, increasing the scope of operations
and resources of our competitors, which, in turn, could adversely affect
our ability to compete.  Independence Air is not a member of any
marketing alliance. Our lack of a marketing alliance could harm our
business and competitive ability.  We also do not participate in
interline baggage handling agreements, under which we forward and receive
customer baggage to and from other airlines that may operate flights with
which our customers may be connecting, which may discourage potential
customers from flying on Independence Air.

We rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and any
failure of these systems could harm our business

          We depend on automated systems to operate our business as
Independence Air, including our computerized airline reservation system,
our telecommunication systems, kiosks, and our website.  Our website and
reservation and check-in systems must be able to accommodate a high
volume of traffic and deliver important flight information.  Substantial
or repeated website, reservations system, kiosk, or telecommunication
systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and
could cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline.
While we have backup systems for some aspects of our operations, our
systems have not been fully tested for the volume of transactions
possible in our operations and are not fully redundant, and our disaster
recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.  In order
to provide a reservations system and the infrastructure to receive
customer calls, we contract with third party vendors to provide the
software, hardware, and technical support of the reservations system and
the physical location and staffing for a call center.  We also may need
to rely on third-party vendors to implement our back-up systems, which
would place aspects of maintaining important data beyond our control.
Any disruption in our or our third parties' systems or in the ability of
the third party vendors to provide their services could result in the
loss of customer bookings or important data, increase our expenses and
generally harm our business.

					24

Our inability to obtain and maintain approval from the FAA and the DOT to
operate aircraft could materially affect our operations

          We possess all of the DOT and FAA authority necessary to
operate our fleet of A319 and CRJ aircraft.  We are required to maintain
this authority and to satisfy on-going regulatory requirements in order
to continue our operations.  We recently paid a substantial civil penalty
to the FAA and are involved in an ongoing review by the FAA of the
Company's maintenance records program.  The outcome of this review cannot
be predicted at this time, but could result in additional fines or
actions by the FAA.


We may not be able to maintain access to suitable airports located in our
targeted geographic area

          Independence Air is materially dependent on our ability to
access suitable airports located in our targeted geographic markets for
both our larger, single aisle aircraft and our regional jets at costs
that are consistent with our low-fare strategy. Some airports served by
Independence Air are subject to FAA imposed capacity controls and,
although Independence Air currently has the slots necessary to conduct
operations at these airports, additional limits could be placed on the
airports that might restrict Independence Air's access to them.  In
August 2004 the FAA issued an order limiting hourly operations at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.  The effect of this order caused
the Company to shift the hours of certain of its operations and to place
an upper limit on the number of daily O'Hare arrivals through the end of
April 2005.  Other airports that are not currently capacity controlled
that become severely congested, which could include Washington Dulles,
could become the subject of some regulatory limit and thereby restrict
Independence Air's access to or operations at those airports. Any
condition that would deny, limit or delay our access to airports we serve
or seek to serve in the future would constrain our ability to grow.  A
change in the terms of our access to existing facilities or any increase
in the relevant charges paid by us as a result of the expiration or
termination of such arrangements and our failure to renegotiate
comparable terms or rates could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations. We base our operations predominantly at Washington
Dulles. There can be no assurance that such airport will not impose
higher airport charges in the future or that such increases would not
adversely affect our operations

Our current operations benefit from government support for insurance
costs

          Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the aviation
insurance industry imposed a worldwide surcharge on aviation insurance
rates as well as a reduction in coverage for certain war risks. In
response to the reduction in coverage, the Air Transportation Safety and
System Stabilization Act provides U.S. air carriers with the option to
purchase certain war risk liability insurance from the United States
government on an interim basis at rates that are more favorable than
those available from the private market. Prior to December 2002, we
purchased hull war risk coverage through the private insurance market,
and purchased liability war risk coverage through a combination of U.S.
government provided insurance and private insurance. In December 2002,
the U.S. government offered to provide additional war risk coverage that
included certain risks previously covered by private insurance. We have
purchased, at rates that are significantly lower than those charged by
private insurance carriers, hull and liability war risk coverage from the
U.S. government (through the FAA) through August 31, 2005.  Due to the
cost and difficulty in obtaining insurance in the commercial markets, we
anticipate renewing the insurance through the FAA for so long as it is
available. The FAA has indicated that the extension of its war risk
insurance program past August 31, 2005 is under consideration but has not
yet been approved.  The inability to obtain insurance at any cost or the
availability of insurance only at excessive rates, could affect our
ability to operate.

We have had difficulty implementing in a timely manner the documentation,
assessments,  testing  and  remediation  of  our  internal  control  over
financial  reporting necessary to allow our management to report  whether
our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

					25

          Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we
are required to include a report in our Annual Report on Form 10-K of
management's assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of the fiscal year ending December
31, 2004.  Management, with the participation of the Company's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  is in the process of
conducting an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Our auditors will then be required to attest to, and report on,
management's assessment.  They will also be required to report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  As
reported in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2004, management had identified internal control weaknesses existing at
that time that constituted material weaknesses or significant
deficiencies.  The Company undertook to implement compensating controls
to remediate or mitigate those weaknesses, including segregation of
duties and monitoring controls over the purchasing process and monitoring
controls, to include adequate documentation, over the information
technology control environment.  See Part I Item 9A of this filing,
"Controls and Procedures."   Securities and Exchange Commission Release
No. 34-50754 provides certain companies, including us, up to 45
additional days beyond the required filing date of this Form 10-K for the
filing of management's annual report on internal control over financial
reporting, and the related attestation report of our auditors on
management's report on internal control over financial reporting and the
related report of the auditors on their own assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting.  There can be no assurance that
management will be able to complete the necessary work in a timely manner
to issue its report that our internal control was effective as of
December 31, 2004 or that, upon completing such work, our management will
conclude that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2004.  If we are not able to timely complete our
internal control work necessary for management's assessment and
regardless of whether our management concludes that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004, our
auditor may issue an adverse report or qualify its report on management's
assessment of internal control over financial reporting and/or in its own
report on our internal control over financial reporting.  In addition, we
might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.
Certain material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal
controls also could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.  We also expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of
management's time as a result of performing the system and process
evaluation, testing and remediation required in order to comply with the
management certification and auditor attestation requirements.

Our contracts with two of our unions currently are amendable

          Our contract with Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association
("AMFA"), which was ratified in June 1998, became amendable in June 2002,
and our contract with the Association of Flight Attendants-Communications
Workers of America ("AFA-CWA"), which was ratified in October 1998,
became amendable in October 2002. The AMFA contract covers all aviation
maintenance technicians and ground service equipment mechanics working
for us and the AFA-CWA contract covers all flight attendants working for
us.  In February 2005 we reached a tentative agreement with AFA-CWA, but
the agreement is still subject to the vote of the members.  We have
entered into discussions with AFA-CWA regarding a new agreement, and have
been in negotiations with AMFA since 2003 and more recently have been in
mediation under the Railway Labor Act. Although there can be no
assurances as to the outcome of these negotiations and mediation, we
anticipate ultimately being able to reach agreement with both unions on
mutually satisfactory contracts with no material effect on its results of
operations or financial position. However, the failure to resolve these
negotiations on appropriate terms could affect our ability to compete
effectively.

					26

Our results of operations will fluctuate

          We expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the
future based on many factors including the extent of passenger revenue,
competition, changes in aircraft fuel costs, security costs, weather, the
timing and amount of maintenance and our ability to successfully develop
the "Independence Air" brand, including costs related to aircrafts and
marketing expenditures in this effort. Because a substantial portion of
airline travel (both business and personal) is discretionary, the
industry tends to experience adverse financial results during general
economic downturns. Any prolonged general reduction in airline traffic
may particularly affect us because our business plan is more dependent,
in part, on the stimulation of discretionary air travel. In addition,
seasonal variations in weather and traffic affect our operating results
from quarter to quarter.  Given our high proportion of fixed costs, this
seasonality affects our profitability from quarter to quarter.  Our base
of operations is located in the Washington, D.C. area, and many of our
areas of operations are located in the Northeast, which makes our
operations susceptible to air traffic and airport congestion as well as
bad weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs associated
with deicing aircraft, cancelled flights and accommodating displaced
passengers.  Due to our geographic area of operations and our use of
regional jets, we are more susceptible to adverse weather conditions
along the East Coast than some of our competitors, who may be better able
to spread weather-related risks over more diverse route systems.  As we
enter new markets, we could be subject to additional seasonal variations.
Due to the factors described above, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our
operating results may not be good indicators of our future performance.
In addition, it is possible that in any future quarter our operating
results could be below the expectations of investors and any published
reports or analyses regarding Independence Air.

Our business would be harmed if we lost the services of any key personnel

          Our success depends to a large extent on the continued service
of our executive management team and other key personnel. Although we
have employment agreements with certain executive officers, it is
possible that members of management may resign. Other key personnel may
depart the Company due to our financial condition.  We may incur
unexpected expenses and have difficulty replacing management or other key
personnel who leave and, therefore, the loss of the services of any of
these individuals could harm our business. We fund key-man life insurance
on certain executive officers only to the extent necessary to fund life
insurance commitments under employment agreements in the event of death.

Risk Factors Affecting the Airline Industry

The U.S. airline industry is experiencing significant restructurings and
bankruptcies

          Beginning in early 2001, the industry has experienced depressed
demand and shifts in passenger demand, lower unit revenues, increased
insurance costs, increased fuel costs, increased government regulations
and taxes, and tightened credit markets, evidenced by higher credit
spreads and reduced capacity to borrow. These factors are directly
affecting the operations and financial condition of participants in the
industry including aircraft manufacturers. Several major airlines have
used the bankruptcy process or the threat of bankruptcy to reduce their
expenses and streamline their operations. Our contractual relationships
with others may continue to be affected by other companies' bankruptcies
or by concerns regarding potential bankruptcies. The bankruptcy or
prospect of bankruptcy among other companies that operate in our industry
may result in unexpected expenses and create other risks or uncertainties
that we are not able to anticipate or plan around.

					27

The travel industry has been materially adversely affected by the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and on-going security concerns

          The U.S. airline industry continues to recover from the events
of September 11, 2001 and increased concerns over additional acts of
terrorism. The major carriers continue to experience losses or operate
near break-even levels of profitability even after reducing capacity,
negotiating wage and work rule concessions and, for certain carriers,
filing for bankruptcy protection. Passenger traffic continues to be
negatively impacted by the general economic situation in the United
States, threats of terrorist activities, terrorist alerts, violence in
the Middle East, and increased security measures at the nation's
airports. Instability in the Middle East and other parts of the world has
increased the risk that the industry will continue to be adversely
affected by reduced demand, increased security costs, increased fuel
costs, and other factors. While our code share agreements allowed us to
recover certain of these additional expenses from our partners, no such
cost recovery arrangements are available for our Independence Air
operations, and the effects of any new terrorist attacks and/or security
measures, as well as increased security costs could impair our ability to
operate profitably.

Airlines are often affected by factors beyond their control, including
weather conditions, traffic congestion at airports and increased security
measures, any of which could harm our operating results and financial
condition

          As with other airlines, we are subject to delays caused by
factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, air
traffic and airport congestion and increased security measures. Delays
frustrate passengers, reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs, all
of which negatively affect profitability. During periods of fog, snow,
rain, storms or other adverse weather conditions, flights may be
cancelled or significantly delayed. Cancellations or delays due to
weather conditions, traffic control problems and breaches in security
could harm our operating results and financial condition.

Changes in government regulations imposing additional requirements and
restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and
result in service delays and disruptions

          Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal
requirements, both domestically and internationally, that involve
significant compliance costs. In the last several years, Congress has
passed laws, including extensive airline and airport security laws, and
the DOT, FAA and TSA have issued regulations relating to the operation of
airlines that have required significant expenditures. We expect to
continue to incur expenses in connection with complying with government
regulations. Additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and
charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly
increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air
travel. If adopted, these measures could have the effect of raising
ticket prices, reducing revenue and increasing costs. There can be no
assurance that these and other laws or regulations enacted in the future
will not harm our business.

The airline industry is characterized by low profit margins and high
fixed costs, and we may be unable to establish our brand or to compete
effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or
lower operating costs

          The airline industry is characterized generally by low profit
margins and high fixed costs, primarily for personnel, aircraft fuel,
debt service and rent. The expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary
significantly with the number of passengers carried. As a result, a
relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing could
have a disproportionate effect on an airline's operating and financial
results. Accordingly, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could
harm our business. In addition, the airline industry is highly
competitive and is particularly susceptible to price discounting because

					28

airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers
occupying otherwise unsold seats. We compete with other airlines on
substantially all of our routes. Many of these airlines are larger and
have greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating
costs or both than we do. Some of these competitors may chose to add
service, reduce their fares and/or increase frequent flyer or other
benefits, in some of our markets following or in anticipation of our
entry. Therefore, we may be unable to compete effectively against other
airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that
we serve which could harm our business.

Our  reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of  an
accident or incident involving our aircraft

          An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could
involve repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential
temporary or permanent loss from service, and significant potential
claims of injured passengers and others. We are required by the DOT to
carry liability insurance. Although we believe we currently maintain
liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with
industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we
may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. Substantial
claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance
coverage would harm our business and financial results. Moreover, any
aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured, could cause a
public perception that we are less safe or reliable than other airlines,
which would harm our business.

Item 2.   Properties

          Flight Equipment - Operating:  The following table describes
Independence Air's operating fleet of aircraft, scheduled firm deliveries
and options as of March 10, 2005:

          The Company and Independence Air have entered into a series of
agreements with GE Commercial Aviation Services, Inc. and certain of its
affiliates ("GECAS") as owner participant under leveraged leases relating
to 24 CRJs, and with the various parties as loan participant under those
leveraged leases, providing for the early termination of the leases.
These 24 CRJs, which are included in the table above, are being returned
to GECAS between February and July 2005.

					29

          Independence Air's commitment to purchase 34 CRJ aircraft on
order is subject to certain conditions which, unless waived by
Independence Air by April 2005, can not be satisfied as a result of
United's rejection in bankruptcy of the Company's United Express
agreement.  Independence Air does not expect to waive the conditions and
therefore does not expect to take delivery of these ordered aircraft.  If
Independence Air does not waive the conditions, the remaining $3.4
million on deposit with Bombardier will be returned to Independence Air
in April 2005.

          As of March 14, 2005, Independence Air has taken delivery of
eight leased Airbus 319 aircraft and expects to take delivery of four
additional leased A319s during April and May 2005.  Independence Air also
has executed a purchase agreement with Airbus' wholly-owned affiliate
AVSA S.A.R.L. ("AVSA") to purchase 16 Airbus A319 aircraft with six
scheduled for delivery in 2006 and ten scheduled for delivery in 2007.

          Flight   Equipment  -  Non-Operating:   The   following   table
describes Independence Air's non-operating fleet of aircraft as of  March
10, 2005:

          Independence Air has 33 Fairchild 328Jet aircraft that were
previously operated in the Delta Connection operation.  Independence Air
is in the process of assigning the leases on 30 of these 328Jets to Delta
pursuant to the terms of the Delta Connection agreement.  Upon assignment
to Delta, the Company and Independence Air expects to be released from
any further obligations on these 30 328Jets.  The Company has taken an
early retirement charge for the future rents due on the two remaining
leased 328Jets and recorded an impairment charge for the one owned 328Jet
to reflect estimated current value.  Independence Air is actively trying
to dispose of these three remaining 328Jets either through sale or
sublease transactions.

          Upon the termination of the United Express agreement,
Independence Air early retired its remaining J-41 turboprop aircraft and
recorded a charge for the future rents to be due.  Independence Air has
negotiated the early lease termination for 21 of the 30 J-41s it
previously operated.  Once the J-41s are returned and accepted by the
lessors, the Company and Independence Air will be relieved of any further
obligations on these aircraft.  Of the remaining nine J-41s, seven are
pledged as security under an Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate
transaction which the Company and Independence Air continue to abide by,
one is owned with a related mortgage that Independence Air is actively
looking to sell, and one is leased from a lessor that Independence Air
will continue to negotiate with.

          Leased Facilities

          Airports

          Independence Air enters into agreements for the use of
passenger terminals at most of the airports it serves and leases ticket
counter and office space at those locations where ticketing and its
aircraft are handled by Independence Air personnel.  Payments to airport
authorities for ground facilities are generally based on a number of
factors, including space occupied as well as flight and passenger
volume.  Independence Air occupies a 69,000 square foot passenger
concourse at Washington Dulles.  The concourse, designed to support
Independence Air's regional jet operation, is owned by the Metropolitan
Washington Airports Authority and leased to Independence Air under a
lease with a termination date of September 30, 2014.  Independence Air
also occupies additional gates on Concourse B at Washington Dulles for
its Airbus operation; these gates are owned by the Metropolitan
Washington Airports Authority and are operated under a 60 day Use Permit.
Finally, Independence Air leases gates and terminal space at locations
serviced by it.

          Corporate Offices

          The Company's executive, administrative, reservations and
system control departments are located in a three-story office building
encompassing 77,000 square feet of space under an operating lease ending
December 2010.  Independence Air's employee training and services center
is located in a nearby 79,000 square foot building under a lease ending
December 31, 2007.  Together, these properties provide the necessary
administrative facilities for the Company's and Independence Air's
operations.

          Maintenance Facilities

          The FAA's safety regulations mandate periodic inspection and
maintenance of commercial aircraft.  Independence Air performs most line
maintenance, service and inspection of its aircraft and engines at its
own maintenance facilities using its own personnel.  Independence Air
performs maintenance functions at an 112,000 square foot aircraft
maintenance facility at Washington Dulles, a 34,000 square foot hangar
facility in Columbia, South Carolina, and a 17,000 square foot hangar bay
at the Orlando International Airport.  The Washington Dulles aircraft
maintenance facility is comprised of 60,000 square feet of hangar space
and 52,000 square feet of support and administrative space.  The lease
term for the Washington Dulles aircraft maintenance facility expires
December 24, 2024.  The lease term for the Columbia facility expires on
June 1, 2005 and Independence Air has notified the Airport Authority that
it intends to renew the lease for one year.  The Orlando facility is a
single bay, of a 4 bay hangar operated by another commercial airline, is
leased under a monthly use agreement and can be terminated with 30 days
notice.

          Independence Air performs the majority of its maintenance
function for CRJs at the facility at Washington-Dulles.  Line station
maintenance for the Independence Air operation is provided by contract
maintenance.  Some high frequency stations are minimally staffed by FLYi
maintenance personnel.  Routine overnight maintenance for the Airbus
aircraft is performed by contract maintenance at line stations and by
Company mechanics at Washington Dulles and Orlando.  The heavier
overnight checks are performed at the Orlando hangar facility.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

          Independence Air is involved in legal proceedings related to
the insolvency of Fairchild Dornier GmbH ("Fairchild"), which was
initiated in 2002.  Independence Air holds a bond in the amount of $1.2

					31

million from an independent insurance company, which secures deposits
placed with Fairchild for undelivered aircraft, and has made a demand for
payment under this bond.  Fairchild's insolvency trustee has made a claim
for the collateral posted with the insurance company, and the insurance
company has withheld payment of the bond.  The matter is presently with
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas.  The Company
has fully reserved for the potential exposure related to this matter.

          Independence Air was named in several lawsuits arising from the
terrorist activities of September 11, 2001.  These actions were commenced
by or on behalf of individuals who were injured or killed as a result of
the hijackings of the four flights.  These actions seek compensatory and
punitive damages.  However, pursuant to the Air Transportation Safety and
System Stabilization Act, Independence Air's liability for these claims
is limited to Independence Air's liability insurance.  In each case, the
plaintiffs have named the airlines operating at the airports from which
the flights originated, including Independence Air, under the theory that
all of the airlines are jointly responsible for the alleged security
breaches by the airport security contractor.  The court recently denied
the motion of American Airlines and other defendants, including
Independence Air, seeking dismissal of all ground victim claims on the
basis that the airline defendants do not owe a duty as a matter of law to
individuals injured or killed on the ground. The litigation is
proceeding; however, no discovery has been presented to the non-carrier
airlines. The Company anticipates that it will raise other defenses
including its assertion that it is not responsible for the incidents as
it had no control over the security checkpoints through which the
hijackers allegedly gained access to the hijacked aircraft. As of the end
of the year, only 26 pending claims remain, down from the peak of 101
claims.  While the ultimate number of claims is likely to decrease, there
is a remote possibility that they could rise as a result of potential
environmental claims, which are not subject to the standard statute of
limitation.

          From time to time, claims are made against Independence Air
with respect to activities arising from its airline operations. Typically
these involve injuries or damages incurred by passengers and are
considered routine to the industry. On April 1, 2002, one of Independence
Air's insurers on its comprehensive aviation liability policy, Legion
Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Mutual Risk Management Ltd.
("Legion"), was placed into rehabilitation by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, its state of incorporation. The rehabilitation proceeding
is styled Koken v. Legion Insurance Company, No. 183 M.D. 2002 (Pa.
Commw. Ct.), and is before Judge Leavitt. Currently, Legion can pay no
claims, expenses or other items of debt without approval from
Pennsylvania, resulting in Independence Air directly carrying the
corresponding exposure related to Legion's contribution percentage for
payouts of claims and expenses that Legion represented on Independence
Air's all-risk hull and liability insurance for the 1999, 2000, 2001 and
2002 policy years. Those contribution percentages are 15% for claims
arising from incidents occurring in 1999, 19% for 2000, 15% for 2001, and
8.5% for the first quarter of 2002. Legion ceased to be an insurer for
Independence Air as of April 1, 2002, and there is, therefore, no
exposure with respect to Legion for claims arising after that date.

          The insurance held by Legion on Independence Air's policy was
fully covered by reinsurance, which means that other carriers are
contractually obligated to cover all claims that are direct obligations
of Legion. The Company believes that a "cut-through" provision exists
that causes funds to pass directly from the reinsurers to Independence
Air in situations such as the rehabilitation or insolvency of a primary
insurer. Other companies, including American Airlines, Inc. ("American"),
have similar policy provisions. American intervened in the Legion
rehabilitation and moved to have its cut-through provisions enforced. On
June 26, 2003, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court entered an order
enforcing American's cut-through provisions. The Court ruled that the
reinsurance contract proceeds at issue were not general assets of the
Legion estate. On July 25, 2003, the Court entered an Order of
Liquidation that incorporated the June 26, 2003 ruling. The Order
provides a means whereby a company can intervene to assert rights to its
own reinsurance. The Insurance Commissioner and others appealed. The

					32

appeal remains outstanding. Independence Air intervened in the matter
and, after consideration, the Court held on April 5, 2004, that
Independence Air's reinsurance policies contain an unambiguous cut-
through provision that provides Independence Air with direct access to
reinsurance proceeds in the event of Legion's insolvency or
rehabilitation.  That ruling is now on appeal. If the appeals related to
Independence Air's and American's reinsurance are upheld, the Legion
shortfall should be fully covered by reinsurance. However, if the rulings
are overturned on appeal, Independence Air will likely be underinsured
for these claims at the percentages set forth above. This underinsurance
would include September 11 related lawsuits and any other similar
lawsuits that are brought against Independence Air. Independence Air has
accrued what it believes are adequate reserves for its likely exposure on
claims known to date. No reserves have been accrued for the September 11
related claims.

          During the month of October 2004, Independence Air voluntarily
reported to the FAA that certain maintenance inspection tasks had not
been performed in a timely manner with respect to certain CRJ aircraft.
In all but one case, these inspection tasks were accomplished immediately
upon Independence Air's finding of each issue.  The reports of these
Company actions prompted the FAA to begin a review of certain aspects of
Independence Air's maintenance tracking procedures, which review is
continuing.  The outcome of this review cannot be predicted at this time,
but could result in additional fines or actions by the FAA.

          Independence Air also is the subject of ongoing FAA and TSA
civil penalty cases relating to alleged violations of FAA and TSA
enforced rules and regulations.  Independence Air believes that the
number of such cases and the amount of the civil penalties sought by the
FAA and TSA is consistent with the experience of other airlines with
operations of the size and scope of those provided by Independence Air,
and that the disposition of these cases is not likely to have a material
effect on the Company's financial position or the results of its
operations.

          FLYi, Inc. is a party to a legal proceeding in the Department
of Labor involving a former employee of Atlantic Coast Airlines, Stacey
M. Platone, who alleges that she was terminated from employment in
violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for reporting what she believed to be
an improper arrangement between Atlantic Coast Airlines and one of its
unions.  The complainant's allegations were investigated by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Labor
Department agency with responsibility for investigating allegations of
Sarbanes-Oxley employment violations; in July 2003 OSHA found the
complaint to be without merit.  The complainant filed objections to the
decision, and on April 30, 2004, a Labor Department administrative law
judge ruled that the complainant had been improperly terminated from
employment, although the judge also found that legitimate grounds had
existed to terminate the complainant's employment.  In the decision, the
judge has ordered that the complainant be paid back pay and benefits, and
the costs and expenses of litigation, including attorney's fees.  FLYi,
Inc. believes that this case was wrongly decided and is vigorously
pursuing the appeal.  The Labor Department's Administrative Review Board
granted the Company's petition for review of the judge's decision on July
30, 2004.  The parties have submitted briefs to the Board and are
awaiting its decision.  The Company intends to vigorously pursue the
appeal.

          One party participating as a lender in the leveraged lease of a
single   CRJ   aircraft  declined  to  participate  in  negotiations   to
restructure the transaction, and chose to exercise its available remedies
following  the Company's failure to pay the aircraft's lease  rents  when
due.   On January 27, 2005, the Company was served with a lawsuit in  the
Superior  Court  of  the State of New York, seeking  among  other  things
termination  of  the  lease, repossession of  the  aircraft  and  damages
resulting  from  the  early termination.  Because of  the  obligation  to
mitigate damages with respect to the aircraft, the Company cannot  assess
the amount, if any, that will ultimately be recovered in damages.

					33

          In addition to those matters discussed above, the Company is  a
party  to routine litigation  all of which is viewed to be incidental  to
its business, and none of which the Company believes are likely to have a
material effect on the Company's financial position or the results of its
operations.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

           The Company's management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(e).  Management necessarily applied its judgment in
assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that, by
their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding
management's control objectives. Management does not expect that its
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud. A
control system, irrespective of how well it is designed and operated, can
only provide reasonable assurance, and cannot guarantee, that it will
succeed in its stated objectives.

          On February 22, 2005, the Company issued a press release
stating that on February 18, 2005 it successfully completed a consensual
restructuring of its financial obligations.  The restructuring includes
agreements with a majority of the company's aircraft creditors.
Additional information regarding the restructuring is set forth through
Forms 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February
22, February 23 and February 25, 2005.  As a result of the timing of
completing the restructuring, the resources and personnel required to
complete and document the restructuring and the effects of
the financial restructuring on the Company's financial statements, the
Company has not been able to complete the work required to finalize
certain portions of this Form 10-K, including certain exhibits, by the
date of this Form 10-K.  Exchange Act Rule 12b-25(b) provides that, with
respect to any portion of a report on Form 10-K that is not timely filed
because the registrant is unable to do so without unreasonable effort or
expense, such report shall be deemed to be filed on the prescribed due
date for such report if, among other things, the portion thereof is
actually filed within no later than the fifteenth calendar day following
the prescribed due date.  The Company expects to file the information
omitted from this Form 10-K on or before the fifteenth calendar day
following the prescribed due date.

          The Company's management, with the participation of the
Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
has carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness as of December 31,
2004 of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures.  Based upon the foregoing evaluation, the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of
the period covered by this Form 10-K, the Company's disclosure controls
and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by the SEC, and that material information relating to
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to
management, including the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, particularly during the period when the Company's
periodic reports are being prepared.

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

          The Company's management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as that
term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  The Company's
management, with the participation of the Company's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, in the process of conducting an
evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  As
reported in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2004, management had identified internal control deficiencies existing at
that time that constituted material weaknesses or significant
deficiencies.  The Company undertook to implement compensating controls
to remediate or mitigate those weaknesses, including segregation of
duties and monitoring controls over the purchasing process and monitoring
controls, to include adequate documentation, over the information
technology control environment., The Company is continuing its efforts to
initiate enhancements to aspects of its existing internal control over
financial reporting and to establish and evaluate additional business
functions, controls and procedures related to the Company's Independence
Air operations.

          Management's evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has not
yet been completed.  There can be no assurance that management and/or its
independent registered public accounting firm will conclude that the
weaknesses described in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 30, 2004 were adequately addressed as of December 31, 2004, or
that other conditions will not be determined to have constituted
significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses as of December 31,
2004.  Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34-50754 provides
certain companies, including the Company, up to 45 additional days beyond
the required filing date of this Form 10-K for the filing of management's
annual report on internal control over financial reporting, and the
related attestation report of the independent registered public
accounting firm on management's report on internal control over financial
reporting and the related report of the independent registered public
accounting firm.  The Company expects to file such materials in an
amendment to this Form 10-K, which is expected to be filed no later than
May 2, 2005.

Exhibit 10.12(c)


            AMENDED AND RESTATED SEVERANCE AGREEMENT



          This  Amended  And  Restated Severance  Agreement  (the
"Agreement") was executed by the parties as of the date set forth
on  the  signature page (the "Signature Date") and was authorized
and effective as of November 17, 2003 (the "Effective Date"),  by
and  between  FLYi,  Inc.,  a Delaware corporation  ("FLYi")  and
Independence Air, Inc., a California corporation, and Richard  J.
Surratt ("Surratt").

          Witnesseth That:

          Whereas,  Surratt is currently employed by the  Company
as  Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer,  Treasurer
and  Assistant Secretary, and in connection with such  employment
entered  into a Severance Agreement (last restated as of December
28, 2001) with the Company; and

          Whereas,  the  Company wishes to assure itself  of  the
continued services of Surratt; and

          Whereas,   on   November  17,  2003,  the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of FLYi determined  that  the
best  interests  of the Company would be served by  amending  and
restating the terms and conditions of and benefits provided under
the  then-existing Amended and Restated Severance Agreement  with
Surratt;

          Now,  Therefore, the parties, for and in  consideration
of the mutual and reciprocal covenants and agreements hereinafter
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, do  contract
and agree as follows:

          1.    Employment   Company hereby employs  Surratt  and
Surratt  hereby  accepts  employment by  Company  and  agrees  to
perform his duties and responsibilities hereunder upon all of the
terms  and conditions as are hereinafter set forth.  For purposes
of  this  Agreement,  as  used in the  definition  of  Change  in
Control,  "Company" shall mean FLYi, Inc., and as used  elsewhere
in this Agreement shall mean FLYi, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and
shall  also  mean any successor to FLYi, Inc., including  without
limitation  any  corporation or other entity  into  which  it  is
merged  or  which  acquires  all  or  substantially  all  of  its
outstanding common stock or assets.

          2.    Duties   Surratt shall serve the Company  in  the
capacities of Executive Vice President, Chief Financial  Officer,
Treasurer  and Assistant Secretary.  Surratt shall  generally  be
responsible  for supervising and directing the financial  affairs
of  the  Company  and  of  any other  entity(ies)  to  which  the
Company's  obligations  under this Agreement  shall  be  assigned
pursuant to Paragraph 12.  Surratt shall otherwise be responsible
for  carrying  out  all such other duties and  services  for  the
Company  commensurate with Surratt's position, as may be designed
from  time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of the  Company
(the "CEO").

          3.    Term  of Employment  Surratt's term of employment
under  this  Restated Agreement shall commence on  the  Effective
Date  and  shall terminate on the last day of the calendar  month
which  is  twelve (12) calendar months after the Effective  Date,
unless further extended as hereinafter set forth.  Commencing  on
each  successive anniversary of the Effective Date, the Agreement
shall  automatically  be extended for an additional  twelve  (12)
months  without  further action by either party unless  Surratt's
employment  has previously been terminated or unless  Surratt  or
the  Company  has  provided  notice  of  intention  to  terminate
Surratt's employment pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 10 below,
in  which  case Surratt's term of employment under this Agreement
will be extended to the pending Termination Date.

          4.    Extent of Service  Surratt shall devote such time
and  attention  as  is required to perform his obligations  under
this   Agreement   and   will  at  all   times   faithfully   and
industriously,  consistent  with  his  ability,  experience   and
talent, perform his duties hereunder under the direction  of  the
CEO.

          5.    Compensation  During the term of this  Agreement,
Company  agrees to pay to Surratt, and Surratt agrees  to  accept
from  Company, in full payment for services rendered  by  Surratt
and  work  to  be  performed  by him  under  the  terms  of  this
Agreement, the following:

                A.    Salary.  An annual base salary  as  of  the
Effective  Date of onehundred ninety-three thousand five  hundred
dollars ($193,500), which as of April 1, 2004 was increased to an
annual  base  salary  of  two hundred  fifteen  thousand  dollars
($215,000).  Commencing on October 1, 2005 and on each October  1
thereafter,  the  amount  of  Surratt's  base  salary  shall   be
increased  as  determined by the Compensation  Committee  of  the
Board of Directors of the Company (the "Compensation Committee").
Surratt's  base salary for each year shall be payable to  him  in
accordance  with the reasonable payroll practices of the  Company
as from time to time in effect for executive employees (but in no
event less often than monthly).

                B.    Management Incentive  Plan.  Surratt  shall
participate in the Company's Management Incentive Program, or any
successor bonus plan or program for management employees.

               C.   Executive Bonuses.  Surratt shall be eligible
for  an  additional  annual bonus under an executive  performance
bonus  plan  currently known as Senior Management Incentive  Plan
("SMIP")  for  so  long as the Board of Directors  determines  to
maintain such plan.  Under such plan, each calendar year, Surratt
shall  be  entitled  to  receive a bonus  equal  to  a  specified
percentage  of  base salary upon the attainment of  certain  pre-
established goals.  Such goals and percentage of salary shall  be
determined   by   the  Compensation  Committee   prior   to   the
commencement of each plan year.  The bonus amount each year shall
be  paid  in  cash,  stock, options or such  other  form  as  the
Compensation Committee provides, paid at the time period provided
under  such plan, at the same time and in the same form  as  paid
generally to other eligible employees, except to the extent  that
this Agreement provides otherwise.

               D.   Deferred Compensation.

                 (i)    Surratt  will  be  entitled  to  deferred
compensation under an unfunded and non-tax qualified  arrangement
("Deferred  Compensation") as described in this  Paragraph  5.D.,
which  shall  supercede  and  control  over  all  prior  deferred
compensation  arrangements.   The amounts  credited  as  Deferred
Compensation will be recorded as a bookkeeping entry representing
a  general unsecured obligation of the Company and Surratt  shall
not  have  a  claim  to any specific assets  of  the  Company  in
satisfaction  of  the  amounts,  if  any,  payable  as   Deferred
Compensation.   As  of the Effective Date,  the  balance  in  the
Deferred  Compensation  account  recorded  for  Surratt   equaled
$429,900 and as of the Signature Date the balance in the Deferred
Compensation account recorded for Surratt equaled $591,150, which
is   the   amount   of   the   Company's  Deferred   Compensation
"contributions" under the Severance Agreement between the Company
and  Surratt, as such was amended from time to time, through such
respective  dates.  After the Signature Date,  the  Company  will
credit  Deferred Compensation at the rate of seventy-five percent
(75%)  of  Surratt's  annual base salary.  Deferred  Compensation
will  be  based  on  Surratt's annual base salary  in  effect  on
January 1 in each year, and will be credited as of January  1  in
each  year.   The  Company may provide the Deferred  Compensation
through a benefit plan so long as (1) the amount credited by  the
Company  on Surratt's behalf equals the amount set forth  herein,
and  (2)  the vesting schedule, credit for Years of Service,  and
terms of distribution are all at least as favorable to Surratt as
set  forth  herein.   No  interest or rate  of  return  or  other
appreciation or depreciation of value shall accrue or be  payable
on  amounts credited to Surratt as Deferred Compensation pursuant
to this Paragraph 5.D. unless the Company elects otherwise.

                (ii)  Vesting  of Deferred Compensation  will  be
based  upon "Years of Service," with Surratt to be credited  with
one   Year  of  Service  for  completion  of  each  twelve   (12)
consecutive month period of employment with the Company beginning
on  the  first day of Surratt's employment with the  Company  and
ending  on  the  Deferred Compensation Ending  Date  (as  defined
below).   (That  is, Surratt will continue to  be  credited  with
Years  of  Service  during any applicable  Severance  Period,  as
further  provided in Paragraph 10.E.(iv) hereof.)   Surratt  will
become vested in the Deferred Compensation based on the following
schedule:

                                   PERCENTAGE
     YEARS OF SERVICE              VESTED
     LESS THAN 4                   0%
     AT LEAST 4 BUT LESS THAN 5    25%
     AT LEAST 5 BUT LESS THAN 6    35%
     AT LEAST 6 BUT LESS THAN 7    50%
     AT LEAST 7 BUT LESS THAN 8    65%
     AT LEAST 8 BUT LESS THAN 9    80%
     AT LEAST 9                    100%

In  the  event of a Change in Control (as defined and  determined
under  Paragraph  8.B.(ii)  of this Agreement)  of  the  Company,
Surratt  shall  become immediately 100% vested  in  his  Deferred
Compensation amount notwithstanding the above vesting schedule.

                (iii)     The "Deferred Compensation Ending Date"
shall  mean the Termination Date (as defined below) if  Surratt's
employment  with  the Company is terminated  at  any  time  under
circumstances  that do not entitle him to Severance  Compensation
pursuant  to  Paragraph 10 of this Agreement, or shall  mean  the
last day of the Severance Period (as defined in Paragraph 10)  if
Surratt   is  entitled  to  Severance  Compensation.   During   a
Severance Period, Deferred Compensation shall continue to  accrue
and  vest  pursuant  to the terms of Paragraph 10.E.(iv)  hereof.
Upon the Deferred Compensation Ending Date, the Company shall pay
to  Surratt whatever Deferred Compensation amount is equal to the
applicable vested percentage of the total amount then credited to
his  account  pursuant to this Paragraph 5.D., provided  that  if
Surratt's  employment  with  the  Company  is  terminated   under
circumstances  in which he is entitled to Severance  Compensation
other  than termination upon or within twelve months following  a
Change  in  Control, the Company shall pay to Surratt as  of  the
Split Dollar Release Date an interim payment of whatever Deferred
Compensation Amount is equal to the applicable vested  percentage
of the total amount then credited to his account pursuant to this
Paragraph 5.D. and thereafter at the Deferred Compensation Ending
Date   shall   pay   to  Surratt  whatever  additional   Deferred
Compensation amounts that are or have been credited to and vested
in  his  account.   The Company shall make any  payment  required
under  this  Paragraph  5.D.  in cash  within  thirty  (30)  days
following the date such payment is due pursuant to this Paragraph
5.D.,  provided  that the Company shall have a right  of  set-off
against,   and  may  reduce  the  amount  payable   as   Deferred
Compensation  by, any amount owed or payable by  Surratt  to  the
Company.

                E.    Split Dollar Life Insurance.  The following
provisions maintain and continue the split dollar life  insurance
funding  commitments of the Company as provided in Paragraph  5.D
of  Surratt's  prior  Severance  Agreement  entered  into  as  of
December  28,  2001.  The Company shall advance amounts  to  fund
payment  of  the  premiums under a split  dollar  life  insurance
arrangement  covering Surratt as provided in this Paragraph  5.E.
As   of   the  date  hereof,  the  split  dollar  life  insurance
arrangement  is provided under a policy or policies with  Phoenix
Home  Life Mutual (such policies and agreements related  thereto,
the  "Split  Dollar Agreement").  The Company shall  continue  to
abide by the terms of the Split Dollar Agreement with Surratt  in
force  on  the  date  of  this Agreement,  but,  subject  to  the
foregoing,  the Company may implement a substitute  Split  Dollar
Agreement so long as the amount of premiums funded by the Company
on Surratt's behalf equals the amount set forth herein.

                (i)   Surratt  shall be the owner of  the  policy
under  the  Split  Dollar Agreement and will have  the  right  to
designate his beneficiary with respect to proceeds of the  policy
payable  upon  his death; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall have a collateral assignment  of
the  policy as security for the repayment of the amounts paid  by
the Company toward the premiums for the policy.

                (ii) The Company shall pay the annual premium due
on  the  policy  in  an amount specified in  this  Agreement,  as
amended  from  time to time.  From and after the Effective  Date,
the  amount  of the annual premium the Company pays  shall  equal
$146,250   (which  is  seventy-five percent  (75%)  of  Surratt's
annual  base salary in effect on July 29, 2002) in each year  the
Company  is  obligated to fund the premium as  described  herein.
Provided  that  Surratt remains employed with the Company  as  of
January  1  in a year, the Company shall, except as  provided  in
Paragraph  5.E.(iii) below, for such year pay, on or  before  the
due  date(s) under the terms of the policy, the entire amount  of
the  annual premium due on the policy acquired pursuant  to  this
Paragraph  5.E.   During  any  Severance  Period,  the  Company's
obligation  to  pay the annual premium due on  the  split  dollar
insurance  policy  shall  end  on  the  Termination  Date  unless
Surratt's  employment is terminated upon or within twelve  months
following  a Change in Control, in which case said payments  will
continue through the Severance Period.

                (iii)      The "Split Dollar Release Date"  shall
mean (a) the Termination Date (as defined below, except that  for
purposes  of  this  provision, if Surratt's employment  with  the
Company  is  terminated  under the  circumstances  set  forth  in
Paragraph 10(C)(i) hereof, then notwithstanding anything in  that
paragraph  the  Split Dollar Release Date shall be the  thirtieth
(30th)  day following the date of receipt of the notice  provided
for  therein) except where Surratt's employment with the  Company
is  terminated upon or within twelve months following a Change in
Control, or (b) the last day of the Severance Period (as  defined
in  Paragraph  10), if Surratt's employment with the  Company  is
terminated  upon or within twelve months following  a  Change  in
Control.   The  Company shall fund payment  of  the  premiums  as
provided  in  the  Paragraph 5.E. in each year  until  the  Split
Dollar  Release  Date.  Upon the Split Dollar Release  Date,  the
following shall occur:

                     (a)   Surratt  shall pay to the  Company  an
amount equal to the total of all premiums paid by the Company  on
the  split dollar policy(ies) acquired pursuant to his employment
with  the Company to the date hereof or subsequently pursuant  to
this  Paragraph 5.E., without interest thereon.  The Company may,
at  its option, collect such amount from any amounts it or any of
its  affiliates owes to Surratt and/or from any amounts it or any
of  its  affiliates are obligated to pay Surratt  in  the  future
pursuant  to  this Agreement.  Upon receipt of such  payment  the
Company  shall release its interest in the policy, or  a  portion
thereof, on Surratt's life acquired pursuant to the terms of  the
Split  Dollar  Agreement, or any or all of the paid up  additions
standing  to  the credit of such policy, if any,  such  that  the
released  interest equals the total of all premiums paid  by  the
Company on the split dollar policy(ies) acquired pursuant to this
Paragraph  5.E.  The Company agrees that the amount of  any  such
release  of  interest by the Company shall reduce the  amount  of
"Liabilities"  (as  such  term is defined  in  the  Agreement  of
Assignment of Life Insurance Death Benefit As Collateral  entered
into between Surratt and the Company in connection with the Split
Dollar  Agreement)  owed to the Company in  connection  with  the
Split   Dollar   Agreement  and  related  Collateral   Assignment
Agreement.   Accordingly, the Company also agrees  to  reduce  to
such extent its interest as acquired by collateral assignment  of
the  policy  pursuant to the Split Dollar Agreement  and  related
Collateral Assignment Agreement.

                      (b)    The  Split  Dollar  Agreement  shall
continue in full force and effect and survive separate and  apart
from  this  Agreement; provided, however, that the Company  shall
have no further obligation to pay any premium on the policy under
the  Split Dollar Agreement which has a due date after the  Split
Dollar  Release Date and such obligation shall be transferred  to
Surratt.

                F.   Discretionary Compensation.  The Company may
pay  Surratt discretionary compensation, bonuses and benefits  in
addition to those provided for herein in such amounts and at such
times as the Compensation Committee shall determine.

                G.   Compensation Upon a Change in Control.  Upon
a  Change  in  Control, whether or not Surratt's  employment  has
terminated,   Surratt  shall  receive  all   of   the   following
compensation, paid at the time of the Change in Control:

                     (i)  Salary. A payment in the amount of 300%
of  Surratt's  annual base salary in effect at the  time  of  the
Change in Control.

                     (ii)  Bonus.  For all bonus plans  in  which
Surratt  is participating as of a Change in Control, the  Company
shall  pay to Surratt a lump sum bonus payout. This payout  shall
consist of a payment in the amount calculated by the formula  [(x
+  y)  * z] where (x) is Surratt's base salary earned in the year
from  January 1 to the date of the Change in Control, (y) is  the
amount  which  is  three times Surratt's annual  base  salary  in
effect  at  the  time of the Change in Control, and  (z)  is  the
percentage  which  under each plan is the maximum  percentage  of
base salary that Surratt was eligible to earn during the year  in
which  the  Change in Control occurred assuming all targets  were
met  in full, whether or not said targets actually were met.  The
payments provided for under this Paragraph 5.G.(ii) will be  paid
within thirty days following the Change in Control in cash or  in
such  other form as bonus amounts generally are paid to  eligible
employees,  or  in  a combination thereof, as determined  by  the
Compensation Committee, whose determination and valuation of  any
non-cash  compensation shall be final and binding, and  shall  be
considered to be full compensation for all amounts due to Surratt
for bonus plans in which he was participating as of the Change in
Control,  and  he  shall not be entitled to any further  payments
under  any of said plans during the year of participation,  other
than  pursuant  to  any  arrangements as  provided  in  Paragraph
5.G.(iv)  below.   Notwithstanding the above, any  bonus  due  to
Surratt   for  years  (or  any  other  applicable  bonus  period)
completed prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs
but not yet paid shall be paid in addition to the bonus described
herein.

                     (iii)     Disability Insurance.  The Company
will  prepay,  to  the  time of Surratt's reaching  age  65,  the
premiums  due on any disability insurance policy as was  provided
to  Surratt  as of the time of Change in Control.  In  the  event
that  the  Company discontinued or reduced the amount of coverage
of any disability insurance within one year preceding a Change in
Control,  the Company shall at the time of the Change in  Control
re-establish  disability  insurance  to  the  amount   previously
provided  and  with equivalent coverage, and shall prepay  future
premiums as provided herein.


                    (iv) Other Benefits Upon a Change in Control.
Surratt  shall  receive  all  of the  other  benefits  separately
provided herein or in other agreements as occurring upon a Change
in  Control.   These  include,  without  limitation,  vesting  of
unvested  stock  options and restricted stock.  In  the  event  a
Change  in  Control  occurs, Surratt shall  be  entitled  to  the
insurance  benefits provided upon Change in Control per Paragraph
10.E.(v)  and the travel benefits, per Paragraph 10.E.(viii),  as
provided upon a Change in Control.  These benefits will apply  at
the  time  of  termination  of  Surratt's  employment,  even   if
Surratt's employment is subsequently terminated in a fashion that
does not give rise to Severance Compensation.

                     (v)   Certain Adjustments.   If, as a result
of  payments  provided for under or pursuant  to  this  Agreement
together  with  all other payments in the nature of  compensation
provided  to  or  for  the  benefit of Surratt  under  any  other
agreement  in  connection with a Change in  Control,  any  state,
local  or  federal taxing authority imposes any taxes on  Surratt
that would not be imposed on such payments but for the occurrence
of  a  Change in Control, including any excise tax under  Section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and any successor or comparable
provision, then, in addition to any other benefits provided under
or   pursuant  to  this  Agreement  or  otherwise,  the   Company
(including any successor to the Company) shall pay to Surratt  at
the time any such payments are made under or pursuant to this  or
the  other agreements, an amount equal to the amount of any  such
taxes  imposed  or to be imposed on Surratt  (the amount  of  any
such  payment, the "Parachute Tax Reimbursement").  In  addition,
the Company (including any successor to the Company) shall "gross
up"  such Parachute Tax Reimbursement by paying to Surratt at the
same  time an additional amount equal to the aggregate amount  of
any additional taxes (whether income taxes, excise taxes, special
taxes, employment taxes or otherwise) that are or will be payable
by  Surratt as a result of the Parachute Tax Reimbursement  being
paid  or  payable to Surratt and/or as a result of the additional
amounts  paid  or payable to Surratt pursuant to  this  sentence,
such  that  after payment of such additional taxes Surratt  shall
have  been paid on a net after-tax basis an amount equal  to  the
Parachute  Tax  Reimbursement.  The amount of any  Parachute  Tax
Reimbursement  and  of  any  such  gross-up  amounts   shall   be
determined  by  the  Company's independent auditing  firm,  whose
determination,  absent  manifest  error,  shall  be  treated   as
conclusive  and  binding  absent a  binding  determination  by  a
governmental taxing authority that a greater amount of taxes  are
payable by Surratt.

                H.   Employment or Termination Following a Change
in  Control.  Provided that he remains employed and  the  parties
have  not  otherwise agreed to amend this Agreement, following  a
Change  in  Control Surratt's employment shall  continue  on  the
terms  set  forth  in  this Agreement and  Surratt  shall  remain
subject  to  this  Agreement,  and be  entitled  to  receive  the
compensation,  payments  and  benefits  provided  for   in   this
Agreement.   In the event that Surratt's employment is terminated
upon  or  within one year following the Change in  Control,  such
that  Surratt  would be entitled to Severance  Compensation,  any
amounts  due at the time of termination as Severance Compensation
under  Paragraphs 10.E.(i) and 10.E.(ii) herein shall be  reduced
by  any amounts paid under Paragraph 5.G.(i) and 5.G.(ii) at  the
time  of Change in Control  (under no circumstances would Surratt
be  required to repay the amounts paid to Surratt under Paragraph
5.G(i)  and 5.G.(ii)), but Surratt will be entitled to all  other
Severance Compensation as provided in Paragraph 10.E. herein.  In
the  event that Surratt's employment is terminated more than  one
year following the Change in Control, Surratt will be entitled to
all  payments  and benefits provided for herein with  respect  to
such termination of employment.

           6.  Benefits

                A.   The Company shall pay for or provide Surratt
such  vacation time and benefits, including but not  limited  to,
coverage under Company's major medical, accident, health, dental,
disability  and  life insurance plans, as are made  available  to
other  executive  employees of Company  generally  (and,  to  the
extent provided by such policies, to Surratt's dependents).

                B.    The  Company  agrees to promptly  reimburse
Surratt   for  any  otherwise  unreimbursed  health  or   medical
insurance  premiums  and/or  uncovered  medical  expenses  up  to
$10,000  per  calendar year under a written medical reimbursement
plan  maintained  for Surratt and other key executive  employees.
If  such  payments are taxable to Surratt, the Company shall  pay
Surratt  a  gross-up  equal  to the estimated  income,  FICA  and
Medicare  taxes  due  with  respect to such  reimbursement,  with
federal  and  state income taxes being estimated at  the  highest
marginal rates.

                C.   Surratt shall be eligible to participate  in
any  profit sharing plan, employee stock ownership plan or  other
qualified  retirement plan adopted by Company to the same  extent
as  other executive employees of Company.  Surratt shall also  be
eligible  to  participate in any stock option, restricted  stock,
stock appreciation rights or stock purchase plans or programs  or
nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements of Company, which
participation shall be at levels as may be determined appropriate
by the Compensation Committee.

                D.    The Company agrees to reimburse Surratt for
the  cost  of investment and tax planning services up  to  $5,000
incurred during each calendar year.  If such payments are taxable
to Surratt, the Company shall pay Surratt a gross-up equal to the
estimated  income, FICA and Medicare taxes due  with  respect  to
such  reimbursement, with federal and state  income  taxes  being
estimated at the highest marginal rates.

          7.    Reimbursement of Expenses  The Company agrees  to
promptly  reimburse  Surratt,  within  fifteen  (15)  days  after
presentation of receipts and other appropriate documentation, for
all  reasonable,  ordinary and necessary travel costs  and  other
necessary  expenses incurred by Surratt in performing his  duties
pursuant to this Agreement.

          8.    Stock Options  The Company may from time to  time
grant  to  Surratt  options under FLYi's  stock  option  plan  to
purchase  shares  of the common stock of FLYi at  the  price  per
share  at  the closing of the trading market on the last business
date prior to such grant.  Any such grant will be pursuant to the
terms of the Stock Option Agreement being utilized at the time of
the  grant for stock options granted to Executive Vice Presidents
of the FLYi, except that options granted to Surratt shall contain
terms  relating to the consequences of a Change in  Control  that
are  no less favorable to Surratt than the terms contained in the
form  of  Stock Option Agreement granted to Surratt on  June  26,
2000.   The  Compensation Committee retains  full  discretion  of
whether to grant any stock options.

          9.    Deductions   Deductions shall be  made  from  any
component  of  Surratt's compensation provided pursuant  to  this
Agreement  or  otherwise for social security, Medicare,  federal,
state  and local withholding taxes, and any other such  taxes  as
may from time to time be required by any governmental authority.

          10.  Termination  Surratt's employment with the Company
shall  be  terminated  only  in  accordance  with  the  following
provisions:

               A.   Disability.

                     (i)   In  the  event  Surratt  shall  become
mentally  or  physically disabled so as to have  been  unable  to
perform  his  duties  hereunder for six (6)  consecutive  months,
subject  to Surratt's right to return to work as provided  below,
Company  shall  have the right to terminate Surratt's  employment
with  Company  upon  the  expiration of such  six  month  period;
provided,  however, that upon any such termination Company  shall
be  obligated  to provide Surratt with Severance Compensation  as
provided in Paragraph 10.E. herein.  Such six-month period  shall
be  deemed  to have commenced on the date when Surratt  is  first
unable  to perform his duties on a substantially full-time  basis
because  of  mental or physical disability and shall end  on  the
date  on  which Surratt shall return to the substantial full-time
performance  of  his duties.  If at the expiration  of  such  six
month  period, the Company shall desire to terminate  Surratt  on
the  basis  of disability, it shall give written notice  to  him.
Surratt's  employment shall thereafter be terminated if  he  does
not  return  to substantial full-time performance of  his  duties
within ten (10) calendar days after such notice is given.

                      (ii)  Nothing  contained  herein  shall  be
construed   to  affect  Surratt's  rights  under  any  disability
insurance  or similar policy, whether maintained by the  Company,
Surratt  or  another party.  The Company may utilize a disability
policy to fund, in whole or in part, the compensation that  would
be  due  to  Surratt  during the term of or in  the  event  of  a
disability, in which case the proceeds of the policy would not be
in addition to any compensation otherwise payable to Surratt.

                     (iii)      For  purposes of this  Agreement,
Surratt  shall be deemed to be disabled when he shall  have  been
absent  from his duties because of sickness, illness,  injury  or
other  physical or mental infirmity on a substantially  full-time
basis.   In  the  event  of a dispute as to  whether  Surratt  is
disabled, the issue of the determination of disability  shall  be
submitted to a Board of Arbiters for a binding decision under the
procedures set forth in Paragraph 10.A.(v) below.

                     (iv)     At the end of any disability (other
than  a  disability that results in the termination of  Surratt's
employment  with the Company), Surratt shall return to  work  and
this  Agreement shall continue as though such disability had  not
occurred.

                     (v)   If  there is a dispute as  to  whether
Surratt  is  subject  to  any  disability,  the  issue  shall  be
submitted to a Board of Arbiters (whose decision shall be binding
on  the  Company  and Surratt) consisting of three  persons:  one
physician who specializes in the physical or mental disability in
dispute  (hereinafter  referred to as a  "Specialist")  shall  be
appointed  on behalf of Company by the Chairman of the Board,  or
by  the  Compensation  Committee; a second  Specialist  shall  be
appointed by Surratt and a third Specialist shall be appointed by
the two Specialists so appointed.  The decision of a majority  of
such Specialists shall be binding upon the parties hereto.  If  a
majority  of  the  Specialists determines  that  Surratt  is  not
subject to any disability for purposes of this Agreement, Surratt
shall   return  to  work  under  the  provisions  hereof.    Such
Specialists  may physically examine Surratt, who hereby  consents
to  such  examination and to make available any pertinent medical
records.  The cost of such Specialists shall be paid by Company.

                     (vi)  If  it is determined that Surratt  can
return to work hereunder on a part-time basis, the parties  agree
to  use  good  faith efforts to negotiate the terms of  Surratt's
return to work.

                     (vii)     During any period in which Surratt
is  disabled  but his employment shall not have been  terminated,
Surratt  shall  continue  to receive  his  base  salary  and  any
applicable  bonus, and shall continue to receive all benefits  as
an  employee  and  as  provided  herein  generally.  Any  options
previously  granted shall continue to vest, but  no  new  options
shall  be  issued  to Surratt.  Any mandatory  option  grants  as
provided  herein  shall  be  deferred  until  such  time  as  the
disability period ends.

                     (viii)    During any period in which Surratt
is  disabled  but his employment shall not have been  terminated,
Surratt  shall continue to be credited with Years of Service  for
purposes  of  vesting of Deferred Compensation as  set  forth  in
Paragraph 5.D.

               B.   Death.

                     (i)  Surratt's employment with Company shall
terminate  immediately upon Surratt's death;  provided,  however,
that   Company  shall  be  obligated  to  provide  the  Severance
Compensation as specified in Paragraph 10.E. herein to  Surratt's
estate, heirs or beneficiaries.

                      (ii)  Nothing  contained  herein  shall  be
construed to affect Surratt's rights under any life insurance  or
similar policy, whether maintained by Company, Surratt or another
party.  The Company may utilize a life insurance policy to  fund,
in  whole  or in part, the Severance Compensation that  would  be
payable  in  the  event of Surratt's death,  in  which  case  the
proceeds of any such policy other than the Split Dollar Agreement
would  not be in addition to any Severance Compensation otherwise
payable under this Paragraph 10.B.

               C.   Termination by Surratt.

                      (i)   Other  than  Following  a  Change  in
Control.   Surratt may terminate his employment by delivering  to
Company  sixty  (60) days' written notice, and  such  termination
shall be effective on the sixtieth (60th) day following the  date
of  receipt  of  such notice (the "Termination Date").   In  such
event,  Surratt (i) shall continue to render his services  up  to
the Termination Date if so requested by Company and (ii) shall be
paid his regular base salary and shall receive all benefits up to
the Termination Date.  Surratt will be entitled to payment of any
bonus  due but not yet paid for prior bonus periods (paid at  the
same  time  it would have been paid had Surratt's employment  not
been   terminated),  but  will  not  be  entitled  to   Severance
Compensation,  to any bonus for the current bonus period,  or  to
any  other  compensation, bonus or fringe benefits accrued  after
the Termination Date.

                      (ii)   Following  a  Change   in   Control.
Notwithstanding  the above, in the event of  any  termination  by
Surratt  of  his  employment with the Company which  is  effected
within  twelve  (12)  months following a  Change  in  Control  as
defined  and  determined under Paragraph 8.B. of this  Agreement,
Company  shall  be  obligated to provide Surratt  with  Severance
Compensation as provided in Paragraph 10.E. herein; provided that
payments  made as separately provided in Paragraph 5.H.  of  this
Agreement  shall be deducted from Severance Compensation  due  in
this  event.  The twelve month period will be deemed to mean  any
notice  given within twelve months following a Change in  Control
where  an  actual termination occurs within sixty days  following
said notice.

               D.   Termination by Company.

                     (i)   Without  Cause.  Company may,  without
cause, terminate Surratt's employment under this Agreement at any
time by giving Surratt fifteen (15) days' written notice thereof,
and  such  termination shall be effective on  the  fifteenth  day
following  the  date  such notice is given (said  15th  day,  the
"Termination  Date").   In  the event Surratt's  employment  with
Company  is terminated without cause, Company shall be  obligated
to  provide  Surratt with Severance Compensation as  provided  in
Paragraph  10.E.  herein.  At the option  of  Company,  Surratt's
employment  shall  be  immediately terminated  upon  the  Company
giving  such  notice,  in which case Surratt  shall  continue  to
receive  his full base salary and related fringe benefits through
the  Termination  Date.  Notwithstanding any  provision  of  this
Agreement   to   the  contrary,  any  termination  of   Surratt's
employment by the Company, for any reason or no reason,  effected
as  a  result of, in connection with or within twelve (12) months
following  a  Change in Control, as defined and determined  under
Paragraph  8.B. of this Agreement, shall automatically be  deemed
to  be a termination without cause provided that any amounts  due
as  Severance  Compensation  shall  be  reduced  as  provided  in
Paragraph  5.H.  The twelve month period will be deemed  to  mean
any  notice  given  within twelve months following  a  Change  in
Control  regardless of when actual termination  occurs  following
said notice.

                      (ii)   For  Cause.  Company  may  terminate
Surratt's   employment  under  this  Agreement  immediately   for
"cause".   In  such  event, the Company shall not  be  liable  to
Surratt for any compensation, bonus or benefits after the date of
termination of employment. Cause shall be defined as any  of  the
following:  (i) willful unauthorized misconduct in  the  material
performance of Surratt's duties hereunder, (ii) commission of  an
act  of  theft,  fraud,  dishonesty  or  personal  misconduct  by
Surratt,  which act is harmful to Company, (iii)  breach  of  any
provision of this Agreement if such breach has not been cured  by
Surratt  (or if Surratt has not compensated the Company for  such
breach  by payment of an amount deemed reasonable by the  Company
if the breach cannot be cured) within fifteen (15) days after the
Company  gives  Surratt  written  notice  of  such  breach.   Any
termination  under  this Paragraph 10.D.(ii)  shall  take  effect
immediately  upon  the  Company  giving  Surratt  written  notice
thereof.

                  E.      Severance   Compensation.    "Severance
Compensation" is defined as all of the compensation and  benefits
described in this Paragraph 10.E.  It will be provided to Surratt
upon  the occurrence of any of the events described elsewhere  in
this  Agreement as providing for Surratt's receipt  of  Severance
Compensation,  but not in any other circumstances except  to  the
extent  that individual components of Severance Compensation  may
be  separately provided pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement.
"Termination  Date"  is  defined as the  last  day  of  Surratt's
employment  with the Company.  "Severance Period" is  defined  as
the  period  beginning on the day following the Termination  Date
and   ending  on  the  day  which  is  two  years  following  the
Termination  Date. Benefits extending to Surratt's  spouse  shall
refer  to  Surratt's  spouse as of the  date  such  benefits  are
extended or, after Surratt's death, to Surratt's spouse as of the
date  of his death.  The compensation and benefits to be provided
as Severance Compensation are as follows:

                    (i)  Severance Pay.  Throughout the Severance
Period, Surratt will receive severance pay at the rate of 100% of
his  annual base salary in effect at the time of his termination,
to  be paid on the Company's regular payroll payment dates at the
same  time  and  in  the  same fashion as the  Company's  regular
payroll payments.

                     (ii)  Bonus.  For all bonus plans  in  which
Surratt  is participating as of the Termination Date, the Company
shall  pay to Surratt a lump sum bonus payout.  This payout shall
consist of a payment in the amount calculated by the formula  [(x
+  y)  * z] where (x) is Surratt's base salary earned in the year
from  January 1 to the Termination Date, (y) is the amount  which
is  two times Surratt's annual base salary in effect at the  time
of  Termination, and (z) is the percentage which under each  plan
is  the  highest percentage of base salary that Surratt was  paid
during  any one of the five years immediately preceding the  year
in  which the Termination Date occurred, but which shall  not  be
greater  than the maximum percentage of base salary that  Surratt
was  eligible  to  earn during the year in which the  Termination
Date  occurred assuming all targets were met in full, whether  or
not  said  targets actually were met.  The payments provided  for
under  this  Paragraph 10.E.(ii) will be paid within thirty  days
following the Termination Date in cash or in such other  form  as
bonus amounts generally are paid to eligible employees, or  in  a
combination thereof, as determined by the Compensation Committee,
whose  determination  and valuation of any non-cash  compensation
shall  be final and binding, and shall be considered to  be  full
compensation  for all amounts due to Surratt for bonus  plans  in
which  he  was participating as of the Termination Date,  and  he
shall  not be entitled to any further payments under any of  said
plans during the Severance Period or thereafter.  Notwithstanding
the  above,  any  bonus due to Surratt for years  (or  any  other
applicable bonus period) completed prior to the Termination  Date
but not yet paid shall be paid in addition to the bonus described
herein.  If  such  bonus  for prior  years  is  in  the  form  of
restricted  stock, such bonus will be considered  earned  to  the
extent  that applicable vesting targets have been met as  of  the
Termination Date, whether the confirmation that the targets  have
been  met occurs before or after the Termination Date.   If  such
targets have been met but the stock has not yet been distributed,
Surratt will be entitled to receive the stock, or, at the  option
of  the  Company, the cash equivalent thereof, no later than  the
date the stock was due to be distributed had the termination  not
occurred.   Any such stock for which targets have  not  been  met
will be forfeited.

                     (iii)      Stock  Options.  All  options  to
purchase  shares of FLYI stock that have been granted to  Surratt
and  that  are not exercisable as of the Termination  Date  shall
terminate  as of said date.  For all options that are exercisable
as of said date (including options that are accelerated following
a  Change  in  Control),  the  terms  of  exercise,  payment  and
expiration shall be as provided in each option agreement.

                     (iv)  Deferred Compensation.   The  Deferred
Compensation  program  will  continue  throughout  the  Severance
Period, including Surratt's accumulation of Years of Service  for
vesting  purposes,  and including the Company's  continuation  of
contributions. Alternatively, the Company may elect to  pay  such
amounts  to  Surratt  as would be payable  during  the  Severance
Period by the Company under the Deferred Compensation program  in
a  single  lump  sum payment within fifteen (15) days  after  the
Termination  Date.   At  the  end of the  Severance  Period,  the
Company  shall pay Surratt an amount equal to his vested interest
under   the   Deferred  Compensation  as  provided  in  Paragraph
5.D.(iii), reduced for any interim payments made pursuant to such
Paragraph.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have
a  right of set-off against, and may reduce the amount payable as
Deferred  Compensation by, any amount owed or payable by  Surratt
to the Company.

                      (v)   Insurance  Programs.   In  the  event
Surratt's  employment  with the Company  is  terminated  upon  or
within  twelve  months following a Change in Control,  the  Split
Dollar  Agreement shall continue in full force and effect through
the  Severance Period and shall survive separate and  apart  from
this  Agreement, and the Company's obligation to pay all premiums
pursuant to this Agreement shall continue in accordance with  the
terms  of  this  Agreement  for the  Severance  Period.   On  the
Termination Date (except that for purposes of this provision,  if
Surratt's  employment is terminated under the  circumstances  set
forth in Paragraph 10(C)(i) hereof, then notwithstanding anything
in  that  provision, the Termination Date for  purposes  of  this
Paragraph shall be the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of
receipt  of  the notice provided for therein), or,  if  Surratt's
employment  with the Company is terminated upon or within  twelve
months following a Change in Control, at the end of the Severance
Period, Surratt shall pay to the Company an amount equal  to  the
total  of  all  premiums paid by the Company on the split  dollar
policy(ies) acquired pursuant to Paragraph 5.E., without interest
thereon,  and  upon  receipt of such payment  the  Company  shall
release  its  interest in the policy, or a  portion  thereof,  on
Surratt's life acquired pursuant to the terms of the Split Dollar
Agreement, or any or all of the paid up additions standing to the
credit  of such policy, if any, such that such released  interest
equals the total of all premiums paid by the Company on the split
dollar   policy(ies)   acquired  pursuant   to   Paragraph   5.E.
Alternatively,  if  the  Company  elects  to  pay  the   Deferred
Compensation  to  Surratt  within fifteen  (15)  days  after  the
Termination  Date  pursuant  to Paragraph  10.E.(iv)  above,  the
Company  at  the  time  of such payment may demand  payment  from
Surratt  of an amount equal to the total of all premiums paid  by
the Company on the split dollar policy(ies) acquired pursuant  to
Paragraph  5.E.,  without interest thereon, and upon  receipt  of
such  payment  release  its interest in the  policy,  or  portion
thereof,  acquired  pursuant to the terms  of  the  Split  Dollar
Agreement,  and any or all of the paid up additions  standing  to
the  credit  of such policy, if any, and thereafter  the  Company
shall  be  under no obligation to pay any further premiums  under
the  Split Dollar Agreement.  Coverage under the Company's  major
medical,  accident, health, dental, disability and life insurance
plans  as from time to time provided to other executive employees
of  the Company (and, to the extent provided by such policies, to
Surratt's  dependents)  shall continue to  be  paid  for  by  the
Company during the Severance Period or, in the event of Surratt's
termination upon or following a Change of Control of the  Company
as  defined  in  Paragraph 8.B., for the longer of the  Severance
Period  or the remainder of Surratt's and his spouse's life,  and
including  children to age 21 as per coverage provided  prior  to
the  Change  in  Control.  Provided, however,  if  such  coverage
cannot  be  continued  during  the  Severance  Period  or   until
Surratt's  and his spouse's death, as the case may be, under  the
terms  of  such  policies or plans, the Company  shall  reimburse
Surratt  for  the cost of comparable coverage under  individually
obtained  policies  or for COBRA coverage, or  shall  make  other
arrangements to assure that Surratt has comparable coverage.

                     (vi)  Vacation.  Vacation shall not continue
to accrue after the Termination Date under any circumstances.

                     (vii)      Executive  Medical  Reimbursement
Plan  and  Investment and Tax Planning.  Throughout the Severance
Period,  the Company will continue to promptly reimburse  Surratt
for  any  otherwise  unreimbursed health  and  medical  insurance
premiums  and/or  uncovered medical expenses up  to  $10,000  per
calendar   year  under  a  written  medical  reimbursement   plan
maintained for the Company's key executive employees, and for the
$5,000  per  year  investment and tax planning service  expenses,
incurred  during each calendar year, including the tax  gross-up,
if applicable.

                    (viii)    Travel Benefits. The FLYi, Inc. and
its  subsidiaries  flight pass privileges  currently  granted  to
Surratt will continue for the Severance Period.  Surratt and  his
wife  shall be provided with free travel on the Company's  planes
or on the planes of any successor in interest to the Company on a
positive  space  basis, and his children shall be  provided  free
travel on a space available basis.  Surratt shall not be entitled
to travel benefits on any other airline.

                      (ix)  Deductions  for  Taxes.  Subject   to
Paragraph 5.G.(v), any compensation due to Surratt hereunder will
be  subject to deductions for social security, federal and  state
withholding taxes, and any other such taxes as may from  time  to
time be required by governmental authority.

     11.  Nonsolicitation, Non-Competition, and Confidentiality

                A.   Nonsolicitation and Non-Competition.  For so
long  as  Surratt is an employee of the Company,  and  continuing
thereafter  for  twelve  months  following  any  termination   of
Surratt's employment, or with respect to the provisions  of  (i),
below,  for  the longer of such twelve month period or  for  such
period  as  Surratt is receiving Severance Compensation,  Surratt
shall  not,  without the prior written consent  of  the  Company,
directly  or  indirectly,  as  a sole  proprietor,  member  of  a
partnership,  stockholder or investor, officer or director  of  a
corporation, or as an employee, associate, consultant or agent of
any   person,   partnership,  corporation   or   other   business
organization  or entity other than the Company:  (i)  solicit  or
endeavor  to  entice  away  from  the  Company  or  any  of   its
subsidiaries  any person or entity who is, or,  during  the  then
most recent 12 month period, was employed by, or had served as an
agent  of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (ii) engage
in  or contract with others to engage in any business enterprise,
line   of  work  consulting  contract,  joint  venture  or  other
arrangement which conducts a business or businesses substantially
similar to the business conducted by Company in any area in which
Company  or  any  of its affiliates or subsidiaries  provides  or
plans  to  provide  air transportation to  the  public.   Surratt
acknowledges  that the geographic area covered  hereby,  and  the
period  and nature of the agreed restrictions are reasonable  and
necessary for the protection of the business of the Company.  All
provisions  of  this  Paragraph  concerning  non-competition  are
severable; and while it is the intention of the parties that  all
of  said provisions shall be enforceable, if any one of the  same
shall  be  held  to be unenforceable in whole  or  in  part,  the
remainder  shall  continue to be in full force and  effect.   The
terms  of  this  Paragraph  11.A will  not  apply  following  any
termination of Surratt's employment that was effected as a result
of,  in connection with or within twelve (12) months following  a
Change  in Control.  The provisions of clause (ii) above of  this
Paragraph  11.A  will  not  apply following  any  termination  of
Surratt's  employment by the Company other than for  cause.   The
twelve  month  period  will be deemed to mean  any  notice  given
within twelve months following a Change in Control regardless  of
when actual termination occurs following said notice.

                 B.    Confidentiality.   Surratt  covenants  and
agrees  with the Company that he will not at any time, except  in
performance of his obligations to the Company hereunder  or  with
the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly,
disclose any secret or confidential information that he may learn
or  has learned by reason of his association with the Company  or
any  of  its subsidiaries and affiliates.  The term "confidential
information" includes information not previously disclosed to the
public  or to the trade by the Company's management, or otherwise
in the public domain, with respect to the Company's or any of its
affiliates'  or subsidiaries', products, facilities, applications
and  methods,  trade  secrets  and other  intellectual  property,
systems, procedures, manuals, confidential reports, price  lists,
customer  lists,  technical  information,  financial  information
(including  the  revenues, costs or profits associated  with  the
Company),  business plans, prospects or opportunities, but  shall
exclude any information which (i) is or becomes available to  the
public  or  is  generally known in the industry or industries  in
which  the  Company operates other than as a result of disclosure
by  Surratt  in violation of his agreements under this  Paragraph
11.B or (ii) Surratt is required to disclose under any applicable
laws,   regulations  or  directives  of  any  government  agency,
tribunal or authority having jurisdiction in the matter or  under
subpoena or other process of law.

                C.    Exclusive Property.  Surratt confirms  that
all  confidential information is and shall remain  the  exclusive
property  of  the  Company.   All business  records,  papers  and
documents kept or made by Surratt relating to the business of the
Company  shall be and remain the property of the Company,  except
for  such papers customarily deemed to be the personal copies  of
Surratt.

                D.    Injunctive  Relief.  Without  intending  to
limit the remedies available to the Company, Surratt acknowledges
that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Paragraph
11  may  result in material and irreparable injury to the Company
or  its affiliates or subsidiaries for which there is no adequate
remedy  at  law, that it will not be possible to measure  damages
for  such  injuries precisely and that, in the event  of  such  a
breach or threat thereof, the Company shall be entitled to seek a
temporary  restraining  order and/or a preliminary  or  permanent
injunction   restraining  Surratt  from  engaging  in  activities
prohibited by this Paragraph 11 or such other relief  as  may  be
required  specifically to enforce any of the  covenants  in  this
Paragraph  11.   If  for  any  reason,  it  is  held   that   the
restrictions under this Paragraph 11 are not reasonable  or  that
consideration therefor is inadequate, such restrictions shall  be
interpreted  or modified to include as much of the  duration  and
scope  identified  in  this Paragraph  11  as  will  render  such
restrictions valid and enforceable.

          12.   Assignment  This Agreement, as it relates to  the
employment of Surratt, is a personal contract and the rights  and
interests  of  Surratt  hereunder may not be  sold,  transferred,
assigned, pledged or hypothecated.  However, this Agreement shall
inure  to  the  benefit of and be binding upon  Company  and  its
successors   and  assigns  including,  without  limitation,   any
corporation or other entity into which Company is merged or which
acquires all or substantially all of the outstanding common stock
or  assets of Company.  At any time prior to a Change in Control,
Company  may  provide,  without  the  prior  written  consent  of
Surratt,  that  Surratt  shall  be  employed  pursuant  to   this
Agreement  by any of its affiliates instead of or in addition  to
Company,  and in such case all references herein to the "Company"
shall  be  deemed to include any such entity, provided that  such
action  shall not relieve Company of its obligation  to  make  or
cause  an affiliate to make or provide for any payment to  or  on
behalf of Surratt pursuant to this Agreement.

          13.   Invalid Provisions  The invalidity of any one  or
more of the paragraphs or provisions of this Agreement shall  not
affect  the reasonable enforceability of the remaining paragraphs
or provisions of this Agreement, all of which are inserted herein
conditionally upon being valid in law; and in the  event  one  or
more  of  the paragraphs or provisions contained herein shall  be
invalid,  this instrument shall be construed as if  such  invalid
paragraphs or provisions had not been inserted or, alternatively,
said paragraphs or provisions shall be reasonably limited to  the
extent  that the applicable court interpreting the provisions  of
this Agreement considers to be reasonable.

          14.   Specific  Performance  The parties  hereby  agree
that  any  violation by Surratt of the covenants  and  agreements
contained  herein shall cause irreparable damage to the  Company,
and  the  Company may, as a matter of course, enjoin and restrain
said  violation by Surratt by process issued out of  a  court  of
competent  jurisdiction, in addition to any other  remedies  that
said court may see fit to award.

          15.   Binding  Effect  All the terms of this  Agreement
shall  be  binding upon and inure to the benefit of  the  parties
hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and
assigns.

          16.    Waiver   of  Breach  or  Violation  Not   Deemed
Continuing   The waiver by the Company of any provision  of  this
Agreement may be effected only by a written waiver duly  executed
on  behalf  of  the Company and except to the extent specifically
provided in such waiver shall not operate as, or be construed  to
be, a waiver of any subsequent breach hereof.

          17.   Entire  Agreement; Law Governing  This  Agreement
supersedes  in its entirety the terms of the Severance  Agreement
between the parties dated as of December 28, 2001 and any and all
other  agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties
hereto  with respect to the subject matter hereof, by and between
the  Company  and  Surratt, and contains all  the  covenants  and
agreements among the parties with respect to such subject matter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that  the  Company's
Deferred Compensation contributions or any other compensation  or
benefit  provided  for hereunder was paid, granted,  credited  or
funded under and pursuant to an earlier version of this Agreement
with  respect to service prior to the Effective Date and at rates
provided  for  under such earlier version, then such compensation
or   benefit   need  not  be  again  paid,  granted  or   funded,
respectively,  pursuant to this Agreement.  This Agreement  shall
be  construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth  of
Virginia,  without  regard to principles  of  conflicts  of  law.
Surratt hereby acknowledges that he was given the opportunity  to
be  represented  by counsel of his choosing in the  drafting  and
negotiation   of  this  Agreement  and  that  he  reviewed   this
Agreement.  In  interpreting this Agreement, a  court  shall  not
treat either party as the draftsman of the Agreement.

          18.    Paragraph   Headings   The  Paragraph   headings
contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall in
no manner be construed as a part of this Agreement.

          19.   Release by Surratt  In the event of a termination
of employment by Surratt that results in the payment of Severance
Compensation  to him pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,  in
consideration for such Severance Compensation and as a  condition
precedent  to  the  payment  thereof, Surratt  hereby  agrees  to
execute a full and complete release to the Company releasing  any
and all claims that he may have against the Company including any
claims relating to his termination of employment.

          20.   Notices  All notices permitted or required to  be
given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed  to  have been sufficiently given, subject to the  further
provisions of this Paragraph 20, for all purposes when  presented
personally  to  such party (which in the case of  notice  to  the
Company,  shall be presented to the person holding the office  or

Exhibit 10.12(d)


                       SEVERANCE AGREEMENT



          This Severance Agreement (the "Agreement") was executed
by  the  parties  as of the date set forth on the signature  page
(the  "Signature  Date") and was authorized and effective  as  of
September  4,  2003 (the "Effective Date"), by and between  FLYi,

     Witnesseth That:

      Whereas,  Employee is currently employed by the Company  as
Senior Vice President of _____________________; and

      Whereas,  the Company and Employee desire to expressly  set
forth  in this Agreement the terms of Employee's employment  with
the Company; and

     Whereas, on September 4, 2003 the Compensation Committee  of
the  Board  of Directors of FLYi, Inc. determined that  the  best
interests  of  the Company would be served by setting  forth  the
terms  and  conditions  of and benefits provided  for  Employee's
employment with the Company;

     Now, Therefore, the parties, for and in consideration of the
mutual   and  reciprocal  covenants  and  agreements  hereinafter
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, do  contract
and agree as follows:

          1.    Employment  Company hereby employs  Employee  and
Employee  hereby  accepts employment by  Company  and  agrees  to
perform his duties and responsibilities hereunder upon all of the
terms  and conditions as are hereinafter set forth.  For purposes
of  this  Agreement,  as  used in the  definition  of  Change  in
Control,  "Company" shall mean FLYi, Inc., and as used  elsewhere
in this Agreement shall mean FLYi, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and
shall  also  mean any successor to FLYi, Inc., including  without
limitation  any  corporation or other entity  into  which  it  is
merged  or  which  acquires  all  or  substantially  all  of  its
outstanding common stock or assets.

          2.    Duties  Employee shall serve the Company  in  the

for the Company commensurate with Employee's position, as may  be
designed from time to time by ____________.

          3.    Term of Employment  Employee's term of employment
under  this  Agreement shall commence on the Effective  Date  and
shall  terminate  on  July 31, 2005, unless further  extended  as
hereinafter  set forth.  On August 1, 2005, and on  August  1  in
each  subsequent  year,  this Agreement  shall  automatically  be
extended  for  an  additional twelve (12) months without  further
action   by   either  party  unless  Employee's  employment   has
previously been terminated, or unless Employee or the Company has
provided  notice of intention to terminate Employee's  employment
pursuant  to  the  terms of Paragraph 10  below  (in  which  case
Employee's  term  of  employment under  this  Agreement  will  be
extended to the pending Termination Date).

          4.   Extent of Service  Employee shall devote such time
and  attention  as  is required to perform his obligations  under
this   Agreement   and   will  at  all   times   faithfully   and
industriously,  consistent  with  his  ability,  experience   and
talent,  perform  his  duties hereunder under  the  direction  of
_____________.

          5.    Compensation  During the term of this  Agreement,
Company agrees to pay to Employee, and Employee agrees to  accept
from  Company, in full payment for services rendered by  Employee
and  work  to  be  performed  by him  under  the  terms  of  this
Agreement, the following:

                 A.     Salary.    An  annual  base   salary   of
______________________________________________     ($__________),
shall  be paid to Employee.  The amount of Employee's base salary
shall  be  adjusted annually or otherwise from time  to  time  as
determined  by  the  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board   of
Directors   of   the  Company  (the  "Compensation   Committee").
Employee's base salary for each year shall be payable to  him  in
accordance  with the reasonable payroll practices of the  Company
as from time to time in effect for executive employees (but in no
event less often than monthly).

                B.    Management  Incentive  Plan  and  Executive
Bonuses.   Employee  shall participate in  the  Company's  Senior
Management  Incentive Plan and in its Management Incentive  Plan,
both for so long as the Board of Directors determines to maintain
either of such plans, or any successor bonus plan or program  for
key executives.

                C.   Discretionary Compensation.  The Company may
pay Employee discretionary compensation, bonuses and benefits  in
addition to those provided for herein in such amounts and at such
times as the Compensation Committee shall determine.

          6.   Benefits

               A.   The Company shall pay for or provide Employee
such  vacation time and benefits, including but not  limited  to,
coverage under Company's major medical, accident, health, dental,
disability  and  life insurance plans, as are made  available  to
other employees of Company generally (and, to the extent provided
by such policies, to Employee's dependents).

                B.    The  Company  agrees to promptly  reimburse
Employee  for  any  otherwise  unreimbursed  health  or   medical
insurance  premiums  and/or  uncovered  medical  expenses  up  to
$10,000  per  calendar year under a written medical reimbursement
plan  maintained for Employee and other key executive  employees.
If  such payments are taxable to Employee, the Company shall  pay
Employee  a  gross-up  equal to the estimated  income,  FICA  and
Medicare  taxes  due  with  respect to such  reimbursement,  with
federal  and  state income taxes being estimated at  the  highest
marginal rates.

                C.   The Company agrees to reimburse Employee for
the  cost  of investment and tax planning services up  to  $5,000
incurred during each calendar year.  If such payments are taxable
to  Employee, the Company shall pay Employee a gross-up equal  to
the estimated income, FICA and Medicare taxes due with respect to
such  reimbursement, with federal and state  income  taxes  being
estimated at the highest marginal rates.

          7.    Reimbursement of Expenses  The Company agrees  to
promptly  reimburse  Employee, within  fifteen  (15)  days  after
presentation of receipts and other appropriate documentation, for
all  reasonable,  ordinary and necessary travel costs  and  other
necessary expenses incurred by Employee in performing his  duties
pursuant to this Agreement.

          8.    Stock Options  The Company may from time to  time
grant  to Employee options under the FLYI's Stock Option Plan  to
purchase  shares  of the common stock of FLYI at  the  price  per
share  at  the closing of the trading market on the last business
date prior to such grant.  Any such grant will be pursuant to the
terms of the Stock Option Agreement being utilized at the time of
the grant for stock options granted to Senior Vice Presidents  of
the  Company.  The Compensation Committee retains full discretion
of  whether  to grant any stock options, and if so to change  the
terms of the Stock Option Agreement for any such stock options.

          9.    Deductions   Deductions shall be  made  from  any
component  of Employee's compensation provided pursuant  to  this
Agreement  or  otherwise for social security, Medicare,  federal,
state  and local withholding taxes, and any other such  taxes  as
may from time to time be required by any governmental authority.

          10.    Termination   Employee's  employment  with   the
Company shall be terminated only in accordance with the following
provisions:

               A.   Disability.

                     (i)   In  the  event Employee  shall  become
mentally  or  physically disabled so as to have  been  unable  to
perform  his  duties  hereunder (such determination  to  be  made
solely  by  the Company) for six (6) consecutive months,  Company
shall  have  the  right to terminate Employee's  employment  with
Company  upon the expiration of such six month period;  provided,
however,  that  upon  any  such  termination  Company  shall   be
obligated  to  provide  Employee with Severance  Compensation  as
provided in Paragraph 10.E. herein.  Such six-month period  shall
be  deemed to have commenced on the date when Employee  is  first
unable  to perform his duties on a substantially full-time  basis
because  of  mental or physical disability and shall end  on  the
date  on which Employee shall return to the substantial full-time
performance  of  his duties.  If at the expiration  of  such  six
month  period, the Company shall desire to terminate Employee  on
the  basis  of disability, it shall give written notice  to  him.
Employee's employment shall thereafter be terminated if  he  does
not  return  to substantial full-time performance of  his  duties
within ten (10) calendar days after such notice is given.

                    (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, Employee
shall  be  deemed to be disabled when he shall have  been  absent
from  his  duties because of sickness, illness, injury  or  other
physical or mental infirmity on a substantially full-time basis.

                    (iii)     At the end of any disability (other
than  a  disability that results in the termination of Employee's
employment with the Company), Employee shall return to  work  and
this  Agreement shall continue as though such disability had  not
occurred.

                    (iv) The Company will have sole discretion in
determining whether Employee is subject to any disability.

                     (v)  During any period in which Employee  is
disabled  but  his  employment shall not  have  been  terminated,
Employee  shall  continue  to receive his  base  salary  and  any
applicable  bonus, and shall continue to receive all benefits  as
an  employee  and  as  provided  herein  generally.  Any  options
previously  granted shall continue to vest, but  no  new  options
shall be issued to Employee.

                     (vi)  The  Company may utilize a  disability
policy to fund, in whole or in part, the compensation that  would
be  due  to  Employee during the term of or in  the  event  of  a
disability, in which case the proceeds of the policy would not be
in  addition  to any compensation otherwise payable to  Employee.
Any compensation due to Employee from the Company during a period
of   disability  or  during  a  Severance  Period   following   a
termination  of employment as a result of a disability,  will  be
reduced  by the amount of any proceeds provided to Employee  from
any  disability  policy provided by and at  the  expense  of  the
Company.   Except  as  provided in the preceding  two  sentences,
nothing  contained herein shall be construed to affect Employee's
rights  under any disability insurance or similar policy, whether
maintained by the Company, Employee or another party.

               B.   Death.

                    (i)  Employee's employment with Company shall
terminate  immediately upon Employee's death; provided,  however,
that   Company  shall  be  obligated  to  provide  the  Severance
Compensation as specified in Paragraph 10.E. herein to Employee's
estate, heirs or beneficiaries.

                      (ii)  Nothing  contained  herein  shall  be
construed to affect Employee's rights under any life insurance or
similar  policy,  whether  maintained  by  Company,  Employee  or
another  party.  The Company may utilize a life insurance  policy
to  fund,  in  whole or in part, the Severance Compensation  that
would be payable in the event of Employee's death, in which  case
the  proceeds of any such policy would not be in addition to  any
Severance  Compensation otherwise payable  under  this  Paragraph
10.B.

               C.   Termination by Employee

                       (i)  Other  than  Following  a  Change  in
Control.  Employee may terminate his employment by delivering  to
Company  thirty  (30) day's written notice, and such  termination
shall be effective on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date
of  receipt  of  such notice (the "Termination Date").   In  such
event, Employee (i) shall continue to render his services  up  to
the Termination Date if so requested by Company and (ii) shall be
paid his regular base salary and shall receive all benefits up to
the  Termination Date.  Employee will be entitled to  payment  of
any  bonus due but not yet paid for prior bonus periods (paid  at
the  same  time it would have been paid had Employee's employment
not  been  terminated),  but will not be  entitled  to  Severance
Compensation,  to any bonus for the current bonus period,  or  to
any  other  compensation, bonus or fringe benefits accrued  after
the Termination Date.

                      (ii)   Following  a  Change   in   Control.
Notwithstanding  the above, in the event of  any  termination  by
Employee  of  his employment with the Company which  is  effected
within  twelve  (12)  months following a  Change  in  Control  as
defined  and  determined under Paragraph 12  of  this  Agreement,
Company  shall  be obligated to provide Employee  with  Severance
Compensation as provided in Paragraph 10.E. herein, provided that
any  amounts  due as Severance Compensation shall be  reduced  as
provided in Paragraph 12.C. of this Agreement.  The twelve  month
period  will  be  deemed to mean any notice given  within  twelve
months  following a Change in Control where an actual termination
occurs within sixty days following said notice.

               D.   Termination by Company.

                    (i)  Without Cause.  The Company may, without
cause,  terminate Employee's employment under this  Agreement  at
any  time  by  giving Employee fifteen (15) days' written  notice
thereof, and such termination shall be effective on the fifteenth
day  following the date such notice is given (said 15th day,  the
"Termination  Date").   In the event Employee's  employment  with
Company  is terminated without cause, Company shall be  obligated
to  provide  Employee with Severance Compensation as provided  in
Paragraph  10.E.  herein.  At the option of  Company,  Employee's
employment  shall  be  immediately terminated  upon  the  Company
giving  such  notice, in which case Employee  shall  continue  to
receive  his full base salary and related fringe benefits through
the  Termination  Date.  Notwithstanding any  provision  of  this
Agreement   to  the  contrary,  any  termination  of   Employee's
employment by the Company, for any reason or no reason,  effected
as  a  result of, in connection with or within twelve (12) months
following  a  Change in Control, as defined and determined  under
Paragraph 12 of this Agreement, shall automatically be deemed  to
be  a termination without cause provided that any amounts due  as
Severance  Compensation shall be reduced as provided in Paragraph
12.C.   The twelve month period will be deemed to mean any notice
given   within  twelve  months  following  a  Change  in  Control
regardless  of  when  actual termination  occurs  following  said
notice.

                      (ii)   For  Cause.  Company  may  terminate
Employee's  employment  under  this  Agreement  immediately   for
"cause".   In  such  event, the Company shall not  be  liable  to
Employee  for any compensation, bonus or benefits after the  date
of  termination of employment. Cause shall be defined as  any  of
the   following:  (i)  willful  unauthorized  misconduct  in  the
material   performance  of  Employee's  duties  hereunder,   (ii)
commission  of  an act of theft, fraud, dishonesty,  or  personal
misconduct  by  Employee, which act is harmful to Company,  (iii)
breach of any provision of this Agreement if such breach has  not
been  cured  by Employee (or if Employee has not compensated  the
Company for such breach by payment of an amount deemed reasonable
by the Company if the breach cannot be cured) within fifteen (15)
days  after  the  Company gives Employee written notice  of  such
breach.   Any  termination under this Paragraph  10.D.(ii)  shall
take  effect immediately upon the Company giving Employee written
notice thereof.

                  E.      Severance   Compensation.    "Severance
Compensation" is defined as all of the compensation and  benefits
described  in  this  Paragraph 10.E.   It  will  be  provided  to
Employee  upon  the  occurrence of any of  the  events  described
elsewhere  in this Agreement as providing for Employee's  receipt
of  Severance  Compensation, but not in any  other  circumstances
except  to  the  extent that individual components  of  Severance
Compensation may be separately provided pursuant to the terms  of
this Agreement.  "Termination Date" is defined as the last day of
Employee's  employment with the Company.  "Severance  Period"  is
defined  as  the  period  beginning  on  the  day  following  the
Termination  Date  and  ending on  the  day  which  is  one  year
following the Termination Date.  Should a termination occur  upon
or  within  twelve  months following a  Change  in  Control,  the
Severance Period will end on the day which is two years following
the  Termination  Date.   The compensation  and  benefits  to  be
provided as Severance Compensation are as follows:

                    (i)  Severance Pay.  Throughout the Severance
Period,  Employee will receive severance pay at the rate of  100%
of  his  annual  base  salary  in  effect  at  the  time  of  his
termination, to be paid on the Company's regular payroll  payment
dates  at  the same time and in the same fashion as the Company's
regular payroll payments.

                      (ii)  Bonus.   The  Company  shall  pay  to
Employee  a  prorated portion of any annual bonus amount  accrued
through the Termination Date, provided, however, that such  bonus
amount  will  be  paid at the time that such  bonus  amounts  are
normally  paid by the Company.  Proration shall be calculated  by
the  Compensation Committee based on the percentage of the number
of  days in the bonus period to the actual number of days in  the
bonus period, times the total bonus that would have been paid for
the  entire bonus period had the termination not occurred.   This
prorated   bonus  payment  shall  be  considered   to   be   full
compensation for all amounts due to Employee for bonus  plans  in
which  he  was participating as of the Termination Date,  and  he
shall  not be entitled to any further payments under any of  said
plans during the Severance Period or thereafter.  Notwithstanding
the  above,  any bonus due to Employee for years  (or  any  other
applicable bonus period) completed prior to the Termination  Date
but not yet paid shall be paid in addition to the bonus described
herein.   If  such  bonus  for prior years  is  in  the  form  of
restricted  stock, such bonus will be considered  earned  to  the
extent  that applicable vesting targets have been met as  of  the
Termination Date, whether the confirmation that the targets  have
been  met occurs before or after the Termination Date.   If  such
targets have been met but the stock has not yet been distributed,
Employee will be entitled to receive the stock, or, at the option
of  the  Company, the cash equivalent thereof, no later than  the
date the stock was due to be distributed had the termination  not
occurred.   Any such stock for which targets have  not  been  met
will be forfeited.

                     (iii)      Stock  Options.  All  options  to
purchase  shares of FLYI stock that have been granted to Employee
and  that  are not exercisable as of the Termination  Date  shall
terminate  as of said date.  For all options that are exercisable
as of said date, provided no Change in Control has occurred prior
to  that  date,  the terms of exercise, payment, and  expiration,
shall  be  as provided in each option agreement. For all  options
that  are exercisable as of said date, provided that a Change  in
Control  has  occurred on or prior to that  date,  the  terms  of
exercise,  payment,  and expiration, shall be applicable  through
the end of the Severance Period.

                      (iv)  Insurance  Programs.   In  the  event
Employee's  employment  with the Company is  terminated  upon  or
within  twelve  months  following a Change in  Control,  coverage
under   the  Company's  major  medical,  dental,  and  disability
insurance  plans as from time to time provided to other executive
employees of the Company (including Employee's dependents)  shall
continue  to  be  paid  for by the Company during  the  Severance
Period  in  the  same fashion as prior to the  Termination  Date.
Provided,  however, if such coverage cannot be  continued  during
the  Severance Period under the terms of such policies or  plans,
the  Company shall reimburse Employee for the cost of  comparable
coverage  under  individually  obtained  policies  or  for  COBRA
coverage,  or  shall  make  other  arrangements  to  assure  that
Employee has comparable coverage.
                     (v)   Vacation.  Vacation shall not continue
to accrue after the Termination Date under any circumstances.

                     (vi)  Executive Medical Reimbursement  Plan.
Reimbursement under the Executive Medical Reimbursement Plan will
terminate as of the Termination Date.  Employee will be  entitled
to  reimbursement for expenses incurred prior to the  Termination
Date  if  submitted within three months following the Termination
Date.

                      (vii)      Travel  Benefits.  Flight   pass
privileges  currently  granted to  Employee  for  travel  on  the
Company's  aircraft  will  continue  for  the  Severance  Period.
Employee  shall not be entitled to travel benefits on  any  other
airline.

                     (viii)     Deductions for Taxes. Subject  to
Paragraph 12.D., any compensation due to Employee hereunder  will
be  subject to deductions for social security, federal and  state
withholding taxes, and any other such taxes as may from  time  to
time be required by governmental authority.

          11.       Nonsolicitation,     Non-Competition,     and
Confidentiality

                A.   Nonsolicitation and Non-Competition.  For so
long  as  Employee is an employee of the Company, and  continuing
thereafter  for  twelve  months  following  any  termination   of
Employee's  employment,  Employee shall not,  without  the  prior
written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, as a sole
proprietor,  member  of a partnership, stockholder  or  investor,
officer  or  director  of  a  corporation,  or  as  an  employee,
associate,  consultant  or  agent  of  any  person,  partnership,
corporation or other business organization or entity  other  than
the  Company:   (i) solicit or endeavor to entice away  from  the
Company  or any of its subsidiaries any person or entity who  is,
or, during the then most recent 12 month period, was employed by,
or  had  served  as  an  agent of, the  Company  or  any  of  its
subsidiaries; or (ii) engage in or contract with others to engage
in  any  business  enterprise, line of work consulting  contract,
joint  venture or other arrangement which conducts a business  or
businesses  substantially similar to the  business  conducted  by
Company in any area in which Company or any of its affiliates  or
subsidiaries  provides or plans to provide air transportation  to
the  public.   Employee  acknowledges that  the  geographic  area
covered  hereby,  and  the  period  and  nature  of  the   agreed
restrictions  are reasonable and necessary for the protection  of
the  business  of the Company.  All provisions of this  Paragraph
concerning  non-competition are severable; and while  it  is  the
intention  of  the parties that all of said provisions  shall  be
enforceable,  if  any  one  of the  same  shall  be  held  to  be
unenforceable  in whole or in part, the remainder shall  continue
to  be  in full force and effect.  The provisions of clause  (ii)
above  of  this  Paragraph  11.A will  not  apply  following  any
termination  of Employee's employment by the Company  other  than
for  cause.   The  terms of this Paragraph 11.A  will  not  apply
following  any  termination  of Employee's  employment  that  was
effected as a result of, in connection with or within twelve (12)
months  following a Change in Control.  The twelve  month  period
will  be  deemed  to mean any notice given within  twelve  months
following   a  Change  in  Control  regardless  of  when   actual
termination occurs following said notice.

                B.    Confidentiality.   Employee  covenants  and
agrees  with the Company that he will not at any time, except  in
performance of his obligations to the Company hereunder  or  with
the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly,
disclose any secret or confidential information that he may learn
or  has learned by reason of his association with the Company  or
any  of  its subsidiaries and affiliates.  The term "confidential
information" includes information not previously disclosed to the
public  or to the trade by the Company's management, or otherwise
in the public domain, with respect to the Company's or any of its
affiliates'  or subsidiaries', products, facilities, applications
and  methods,  trade  secrets  and other  intellectual  property,
systems, procedures, manuals, confidential reports, price  lists,
customer  lists,  technical  information,  financial  information
(including  the  revenues, costs or profits associated  with  the
Company),  business plans, prospects or opportunities, but  shall
exclude any information which (i) is or becomes available to  the
public  or  is  generally known in the industry or industries  in
which  the  Company operates other than as a result of disclosure
by  Employee in violation of his agreements under this  Paragraph
11.B  or  (ii)  Employee  is  required  to  disclose  under   any
applicable  laws,  regulations or directives  of  any  government
agency,  tribunal or authority having jurisdiction in the  matter
or under subpoena or other process of law.

                C.    Exclusive Property.  Employee confirms that
all  confidential information is and shall remain  the  exclusive
property  of  the  Company.   All business  records,  papers  and
documents  kept or made by Employee relating to the  business  of
the  Company  shall be and remain the property  of  the  Company,
except  for  such  papers customarily deemed to be  the  personal
copies of Employee.

                D.    Injunctive  Relief.  Without  intending  to
limit   the   remedies   available  to  the   Company,   Employee
acknowledges  that a breach of any of the covenants contained  in
this  Paragraph 11 may result in material and irreparable  injury
to  the Company or its affiliates or subsidiaries for which there
is  no  adequate remedy at law, that it will not be  possible  to
measure  damages  for such injuries precisely and  that,  in  the
event  of  such a breach or threat thereof, the Company shall  be
entitled   to  seek  a  temporary  restraining  order  and/or   a
preliminary  or  permanent injunction restraining  Employee  from
engaging  in activities prohibited by this Paragraph 11  or  such
other  relief as may be required specifically to enforce  any  of
the  covenants  in this Paragraph 11.  If for any reason,  it  is
held  that  the  restrictions under this  Paragraph  11  are  not
reasonable  or  that consideration therefor is  inadequate,  such
restrictions shall be interpreted or modified to include as  much
of the duration and scope identified in this Paragraph 11 as will
render such restrictions valid and enforceable.

          12.  Change in Control.

                A.    Definition.   As  used in  this  Agreement,
"Change in Control" shall mean (i) any merger or consolidation in
which  the Company shall not be the surviving entity (or survives
only  as a subsidiary of another entity), unless the stockholders
of  Company immediately before such merger or consolidation  own,
directly  or  indirectly  immediately following  such  merger  or
consolidation, substantially all of the combined voting power  of
the  surviving  entity in substantially the  same  proportion  as
their  ownership immediately before such merger or consolidation,
(ii) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets
to  any  other  person  or  entity  (other  than  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary),  (iii)  the acquisition of beneficial  ownership  or
control  of  (including, without limitation, power to vote)  more
than  50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock by any person
or  entity  (including a "group" as defined by or  under  Section
13(d)(3)   of   the  Exchange  Act),  (iv)  the  dissolution   or
liquidation   of  the  Company,  (v)  a  contested  election   of
directors, as a result of which or in connection with  which  the
persons who were directors of the Company before such election or
their  nominees cease to constitute a majority of the  Board,  or
(vi)  any  other  event specified by the Compensation  Committee.
The  Compensation  Committee  reserves  the  right  to  adopt   a
different  definition  of  Change in Control  for  stock  options
granted  subsequent to the date hereof or for any other  purposes
not described herein.

                B.   Compensation Upon a Change in Control.  Upon
a  Change  in  Control, whether or not Employee's employment  has
terminated,   Employee  shall  receive  all  of   the   following
compensation, paid at the time of the Change in Control:

                    (i)  Salary.  A payment in the amount of 200%
of  Employee's annual base salary in effect at the  time  of  the
Change in Control.

                     (ii)  Bonus.  For all bonus plans  in  which
Employee is participating as of a Change in Control, the  Company
shall  pay  to  Employee a lump sum bonus  payout.   This  payout
shall  consist  of  a  payment in the amount  calculated  by  the
formula [(x + y) * z] where (x) is Employee's base salary  earned
in  the year of the Change in Control from January 1 to the  date
of  the  Change in Control, (y) is the amount which is two  times
Employee's annual base salary in effect at the time of the Change
in  Control, and (z) is the percentage which under each  plan  is
the  maximum percentage of base salary that Employee was eligible
to  earn  during the year in which the Change in Control occurred
assuming  all  targets  were met in full,  whether  or  not  said
targets  actually were met. The payments provided for under  this
Paragraph 12.B.(ii) will be paid within thirty days following the
Change  in Control in cash or in such other form as bonus amounts
generally  are  paid to eligible employees, or in  a  combination
thereof,  as  determined  by  the Compensation  Committee,  whose
determination and valuation of any non-cash compensation shall be
final and binding and shall be considered to be full compensation
for  all amounts due to Employee for bonus plans in which he  was
participating as of the Change in Control, and he  shall  not  be
entitled  to any further payments under any of said plans  during
the   year   of  participation,  other  than  pursuant   to   any
arrangements   as   provided   in  Paragraph   12.B.(iv)   below.
Notwithstanding  the above, any bonus due to Employee  for  years
(or  any  other applicable bonus period) completed prior  to  the
date on which the Change of Control occurs but not yet paid shall
be paid in addition to the bonus described herein.

                      (iii)    Disability Insurance.  The Company
will  prepay, for two full years following the Change of Control,
the  premiums  due  on  any disability insurance  policy  as  was
provided to Employee as of the time of Change in Control.  In the
event  that  the Company discontinued or reduced  the  amount  of
coverage of any disability insurance within one year preceding  a
Change in Control, the Company shall at the time of the Change in
Control   re-establish  disability  insurance   to   the   amount
previously  provided  and  with equivalent  coverage,  and  shall
prepay future premiums as provided herein.

                      (iv)      Other  Compensation.   All  other
compensation separately provided in this Agreement  or  in  other
agreements  as  occurring upon a Change  in  Control,  including,
without  limitation,  vesting  of  unvested  stock  options   and
restricted stock.

                C.   Subsequent Termination Following a Change in
Control.  In  the event that Employee's employment is  terminated
upon or within one year following the Change in Control such that
Employee would be entitled to Severance Compensation, any amounts
due  at  the time of termination as Severance Compensation  under
10.E.(i)  and  10.E.(ii) herein shall be reduced by  any  amounts
paid under Paragraph 12.B.(i) and 12.B.(ii) at the time of Change
in Control  (under no circumstances would Employee be required to
repay  the  amounts paid to Employee under Paragraph 12.B.(i)  or
12.B.(ii)), but Employee will be entitled to all other  Severance
Compensation as provided in Paragraph 10.E. herein.  In the event
that  Employee's  employment is terminated  more  than  one  year
following the Change in Control, Employee will be entitled to the
benefits provided in Paragraphs 10.E.(i) and 10.E.(ii) herein.

                D.    Certain  Adjustments.  If, as a  result  of
payments  provided  for  under  or  pursuant  to  this  Agreement
together  with  all other payments in the nature of  compensation
provided  to  or  for  the benefit of Employee  under  any  other
agreement  in  connection with a Change in  Control,  any  state,
local  or  federal taxing authority imposes any taxes on Employee
that would not be imposed on such payments but for the occurrence
of  a  Change in Control, including any excise tax under  Section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and any successor or comparable
provision, then, in addition to any other benefits provided under
or   pursuant  to  this  Agreement  or  otherwise,  the   Company
(including any successor to the Company) shall pay to Employee at
the time any such payments are made under or pursuant to this  or
the  other agreements, an amount equal to the amount of any  such
taxes  imposed or to be imposed on Employee  (the amount  of  any
such  payment, the "Parachute Tax Reimbursement").  In  addition,
the Company (including any successor to the Company) shall "gross
up" such Parachute Tax Reimbursement by paying to Employee at the
same  time an additional amount equal to the aggregate amount  of
any additional taxes (whether income taxes, excise taxes, special
taxes, employment taxes or otherwise) that are or will be payable
by  Employee as a result of the Parachute Tax Reimbursement being
paid  or payable to Employee and/or as a result of the additional
amounts  paid  or payable to Employee pursuant to this  sentence,
such  that after payment of such additional taxes Employee  shall
have  been paid on a net after-tax basis an amount equal  to  the
Parachute  Tax  Reimbursement.  The amount of any  Parachute  Tax
Reimbursement  and  of  any  such  gross-up  amounts   shall   be
determined  by  the  Company's independent auditing  firm,  whose
determination,  absent  manifest  error,  shall  be  treated   as
conclusive  and  binding  absent a  binding  determination  by  a
governmental taxing authority that a greater amount of taxes  are
payable by Employee.

          13.   Assignment  This Agreement, as it relates to  the
employment of Employee, is a personal contract and the rights and
interests  of  Employee hereunder may not be  sold,  transferred,
assigned, pledged or hypothecated.  However, this Agreement shall
inure  to  the  benefit of and be binding upon  Company  and  its
successors   and  assigns  including,  without  limitation,   any
corporation or other entity into which Company is merged or which
acquires all or substantially all of the outstanding common stock
or  assets  of Company.  Company may provide, without  the  prior
written  consent  of Employee, that Employee  shall  be  employed
pursuant to this Agreement by any of its affiliates instead of or
in addition to Company, and in such case all references herein to
the  "Company"  shall  be  deemed to  include  any  such  entity,
provided  that  such  action shall not  relieve  Company  of  its
obligation  to make or cause an affiliate to make or provide  for
any  payment  to  or  on  behalf of  Employee  pursuant  to  this
Agreement.

          14.   Invalid Provisions  The invalidity of any one  or
more of the paragraphs or provisions of this Agreement shall  not
affect  the reasonable enforceability of the remaining paragraphs
or provisions of this Agreement, all of which are inserted herein
conditionally upon being valid in law; and in the  event  one  or
more  of  the paragraphs or provisions contained herein shall  be
invalid,  this instrument shall be construed as if  such  invalid
paragraphs or provisions had not been inserted or, alternatively,
said paragraphs or provisions shall be reasonably limited to  the
extent  that the applicable court interpreting the provisions  of
this Agreement considers to be reasonable.

          15.   Specific  Performance  The parties  hereby  agree
that  any  violation by Employee of the covenants and  agreements
contained  herein shall cause irreparable damage to the  Company,
and  the  Company may, as a matter of course, enjoin and restrain
said  violation by Employee by process issued out of a  court  of
competent  jurisdiction, in addition to any other  remedies  that
said court may see fit to award.

          16.   Binding  Effect  All the terms of this  Agreement
shall  be  binding upon and inure to the benefit of  the  parties
hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and
assigns.

          17.    Waiver   of  Breach  or  Violation  Not   Deemed
Continuing   The waiver by the Company of any provision  of  this
Agreement may be effected only by a written waiver duly  executed
on  behalf  of  the Company and except to the extent specifically
provided in such waiver shall not operate as, or be construed  to
be, a waiver of any subsequent breach hereof.

          18.   Entire  Agreement; Law Governing  This  Agreement
supersedes  and any and all other agreements, either oral  or  in
writing,  between the parties hereto with respect to the  subject
matter  hereof,  by  and between the Company  and  Employee,  and
contains all the covenants and agreements among the parties  with
respect  to  such subject matter.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to  the  extent  that  any compensation or benefit  provided  for
hereunder  was  paid,  granted,  credited  or  funded  under  and
pursuant to an earlier version of this Agreement with respect  to
service  prior  to the Effective Date and at rates  provided  for
under  such  earlier version, then such compensation  or  benefit
need not be again paid, granted or funded, respectively, pursuant
to   this  Agreement.   This  Agreement  shall  be  construed  in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without
regard  to  principles  of  conflicts  of  law.  Employee  hereby
acknowledges that he was given the opportunity to be  represented
by  counsel  of  his choosing in the drafting and negotiation  of
this   Agreement  and  that  he  reviewed  this   Agreement.   In
interpreting this Agreement, a court shall not treat either party
as the draftsman of the Agreement.

          19.    Paragraph   Headings   The  Paragraph   headings
contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall in
no manner be construed as a part of this Agreement.

          20.  Release by Employee  In the event of a termination
of  employment  by  Employee  that  results  in  the  payment  of
Severance  Compensation to him pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this
Agreement,  in consideration for such Severance Compensation  and
as  a condition precedent to the payment thereof, Employee hereby
agrees  to  execute a full and complete release  to  the  Company
releasing any and all claims that he may have against the Company
including any claims relating to his termination of employment.

          21.   Notices  All notices permitted or required to  be
given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed  to  have been sufficiently given, subject to the  further
provisions of this Paragraph 21, for all purposes when  presented
personally  to  such party (which in the case of  notice  to  the
Company,  shall be presented to the person holding the office  or

                    Fax No. (703) 650-6294

address  shall  also  be  given in the manner  set  forth  above.
Whenever  the  giving of notice is required, the giving  of  such
notice  may be waived in writing by the party entitled to receive
such notice.

In   Witness  Whereof,  the  Company  has  hereunto  caused  this
