<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet Systems, Inc. (&#147;AirNet&#148;) is a specialty air carrier for time-sensitive deliveries, operating
between most major U.S. cities each working day. AirNet is the leading transporter of cancelled
checks and related information for the U.S. banking industry. AirNet also provides specialized,
high-priority delivery services to customers, primarily those involved in the life sciences and
media and entertainment industries. During the first nine months of 2006, AirNet also provided
private passenger charter services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Jetride, Inc. (&#147;Jetride&#148;).
As described below, the Jetride passenger charter business was sold on September&nbsp;26, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to regularly scheduled delivery services, AirNet offers on-demand cargo charter
delivery services for both Bank Services and Express Services customers. AirNet also provides
ground pick-up and delivery services throughout the nation seven days per week, primarily through a
network of third-party vendors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s air and ground network provides highly reliable, time-critical delivery services to its
customers. Later pick-up and earlier delivery times than those offered by other national carriers
is one of the primary differentiating characteristics of AirNet&#146;s time-critical delivery network.
AirNet&#146;s flight schedule is designed to provide delivery times between midnight and 8:00 a.m.,
providing earlier delivery times than those generally available through other national carriers.
AirNet uses a number of proprietary customer service and management information systems to sort,
dispatch, track and control the flow of packages throughout AirNet&#146;s delivery system. AirNet
provides customer service 24 hours per day, seven days a week to assist customers with shipment
orders, inquiries, supply requests and proof of delivery documentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet operated a fleet of 101 aircraft (including 30 LearJets and 14
Cessna Caravan turboprops) that depart from over 85 cities and complete more than 400 flights per
night, primarily Monday through Thursday night. Approximately 15% of AirNet&#146;s weekday flights are
subcontracted to third-party aircraft operators. To supplement its air transportation network,
AirNet uses commercial passenger airlines to provide additional services when its aircraft are not
operating and to provide service to markets that AirNet flights do not serve.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As the banking industry continues its transition to image products and other electronic
alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks, AirNet continues to consult with its
Bank Services customers to determine their future requirements for air transportation services. As
a result of these discussions, AirNet recently made significant changes to its air transportation
network to meet the evolving needs of its Bank Services customers, and in many circumstances, to
lower their transportation costs. These changes were effective March&nbsp;26, 2007 and resulted in the
elimination of 45 flights, or approximately 10%, of AirNet&#146;s weekday flight schedule. For
additional information on these flight changes, see the discussion under the caption &#147;Bank Services

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;26, 2006, AirNet, Jetride, and Pinnacle Air, LLC (&#147;Pinnacle&#148;) entered into a purchase
agreement regarding the sale of Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business to Pinnacle (the &#147;Purchase
Agreement&#148;). The sale was completed on September&nbsp;26, 2006. The purchase price was $41.0&nbsp;million
in cash, of which $40.0&nbsp;million was consideration for the sale of nine company-owned aircraft and
related engine maintenance programs and $1.0&nbsp;million was consideration for the sale of all of the
outstanding capital stock of a newly-created subsidiary of Jetride, also called Jetride, Inc. (&#147;New
Jetride&#148;). Upon completion of the sale transaction, Jetride amended its articles of incorporation
to change its name to 7250 STARCHECK, INC. Of the total consideration, $40.0&nbsp;million was paid at
closing and $1.0&nbsp;million was paid into escrow to cover indemnification claims which may be made by
Pinnacle for up to eighteen months after the closing. To the extent the escrow amount is not used
to satisfy indemnification claims, the escrow amount is to be released to AirNet in two
installments approximately six and twelve months after the closing. In March&nbsp;2007, $500,000 of the
escrowed amount was released to AirNet. AirNet retained the net working capital of the Jetride
business, which was approximately $2.2&nbsp;million as of the closing date. In connection with the
closing of the sale transaction, Jetride repaid in full six term loans which had been secured by
aircraft used in Jetride&#146;s

repaid was approximately $28.2&nbsp;million plus accrued interest and early termination prepayment
penalties of approximately
$0.3&nbsp;million through the repayment date. Following repayment of Jetride&#146;s loans and expenses
related to the transaction, AirNet used the remaining sale proceeds to further reduce debt
outstanding under AirNet&#146;s secured revolving credit facility. AirNet&#146;s lenders under the secured
revolving credit facility had consented to the sale of the Jetride passenger charter business and
the various transactions necessary to complete the sale.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the transaction, AirNet agreed to provide certain transition services to
Pinnacle and its subsidiaries for various specified time periods and various monthly fees, which
initially aggregate to approximately $37,500 per month, primarily for aircraft maintenance
management services. In addition, AirNet entered into three subleases with New Jetride, each for a
one year term, under which New Jetride leases a portion of AirNet&#146;s facilities located at
Rickenbacker International Airport, Dallas Love Field and Birmingham International Airport. The
aggregate lease payment under the three subleases is approximately $10,000 per month.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pinnacle made offers of employment to all of the employees of Jetride and substantially all of the
Jetride pilots and other employees accepted employment with Pinnacle. Wynn D. Peterson, who had
served as AirNet&#146;s Senior Vice President, Jetride Services, resigned as an executive officer of
AirNet to become President of Pinnacle and New Jetride, which became a subsidiary of Pinnacle upon
completion of the sale transaction.

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148; </I>AirNet has classified the assets and liabilities of
Passenger Charter Services as assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations and
presented this operating segment&#146;s results of operations as discontinued operations for all periods
presented. As a result of the disposition of the Jetride passenger charter business, AirNet has
only one reportable segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from Passenger Charter Services, included in discontinued operations, were approximately
$16.9&nbsp;million, $29.5&nbsp;million and $18.5&nbsp;million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income from
discontinued operations before income taxes for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $0.1&nbsp;million,
$0.8&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million, respectively. Included in the 2006 income from discontinued
operations before income taxes is a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, which is net of
approximately $1.0&nbsp;million of investment banking and legal fees associated with the sale of
Jetride.

banking customers to reduce their float costs and related processing fees. AirNet also
transports other items, such as proof of deposit transactions and interoffice mail, for many
of the same bank customers. The U.S. banking industry, including commercial banks and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Business Strategy</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet plans to continue to provide transportation services to the banking industry, but expects
that its Bank Services revenues will continue to decline in future periods as a result of the
increasing use by Bank Services customers of image products and other electronic alternatives to
the physical movement of cancelled checks. AirNet will continue to evaluate and adjust its network
fleet operation and size in response to these changing business conditions and the needs of its
Express Services customers. AirNet is working with individual Bank Services customers to
understand their future transportation requirements and to restructure contractual relationships.
AirNet is requesting that many of its more significant Bank Services customers provide AirNet with
an estimate of their future air transportation requirements to assist AirNet in planning changes to
its transportation network. These estimates will allow AirNet to restructure its transportation
network and provide advance notice of such changes to its customers thereby providing a measure of
service predictability for those customers. In addition, AirNet will review its ground operations
for efficiencies and cost reductions as AirNet reduces its air transportation network. AirNet will
continue to focus on maximizing cash flow. During the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and
2005, AirNet reduced its outstanding debt by approximately $48&nbsp;million and $6&nbsp;million,
respectively, of which approximately $39&nbsp;million in 2006 related to the sale of Jetride&#146;s passenger
charter business, as described above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s business strategy is focused on increasing Express Services revenues in 2007 and
subsequent years. AirNet intends to increase its focus on Express Services customers in
time-critical, time-definite, and high control delivery markets, including medical testing
laboratories, radioactive pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, controlled sensitive media and
mission critical parts. AirNet also intends to establish relationships with specialized freight
forwarders operating in these markets that may benefit from the competitive advantages offered by
AirNet&#146;s air transportation network. AirNet believes its air transportation network provides
certain competitive advantages over other freight forwarders that must rely primarily upon
commercial passenger airlines to process their shipments. These advantages include later tendering
times, better on-time performance, greater control of shipments, reliable shipment tracking
systems and greater flexibility in the design of transportation solutions for customers with
specific needs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The current aircraft in AirNet&#146;s fleet were originally designed to meet the delivery needs of
AirNet&#146;s bank customers and have relatively small cargo capacities. AirNet&#146;s current aircraft are
not readily adaptable to the transportation of many types of larger air cargo. Therefore, AirNet
intends to focus on customers with smaller sized package requirements in the time-critical,
time-definite and high control delivery markets. AirNet also is evaluating other types of aircraft
that may be more suitable for the transportation of packages for Express Services customers. If
AirNet is unable to significantly increase its Express Services revenues and contribution margins,
the anticipated decline in AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues will require significant changes in
AirNet&#146;s air transportation network, including further reductions in its airline route schedule,
the number of aircraft it operates, and operating and administrative costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet plans on utilizing its internal aircraft maintenance competency by providing retail
maintenance services for New Jetride, other Part&nbsp;135 air carriers, and other corporate owned
aircraft. Additionally, AirNet expects that it will be necessary to implement cost reductions in
its administration, ground support and air operations. AirNet will continue to evaluate and adjust
its current fleet and aircraft types in terms of future service requirements and maintenance and
operating costs and expects to make additional changes in its aircraft fleet over time. In
December&nbsp;2006, AirNet entered into an agreement to sell all nine of its Cessna 310 aircraft for
approximately $0.4&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January of 2005, AirNet engaged Brown Gibbons Lang &#038; Company (&#147;BGL&#148;) to serve as AirNet&#146;s
exclusive financial advisor and investment banker to review, develop and evaluate various strategic
alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including the possible sale of AirNet. AirNet received
indications of interest with respect to the sale of AirNet, which culminated in the execution of a
letter of intent for the sale of AirNet on October&nbsp;26, 2005. On December&nbsp;16, 2005, AirNet
announced that it had been unable to reach a definitive merger agreement with the private equity
investment firm that entered into the letter of intent and that the exclusivity period under such
letter of intent had been allowed to expire.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Following the termination of the letter of intent, in December of 2005, the AirNet Board of
Directors dissolved the Special Committee which had been established to oversee the marketing
process and appointed a Strategy Committee to work with management on the ongoing business strategy
and alternatives for AirNet to enhance shareholder value. The Strategy Committee, together with
the full AirNet Board, determined that AirNet&#146;s business strategy would include operating its
businesses with an emphasis on cash flows from operations while seeking other de-leveraging
opportunities. The AirNet Board elected to continue the engagement of BGL as its financial advisor
on a month-to-month basis in connection with the development and evaluation of various strategies
and opportunities to enhance shareholder value and de-leverage the business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, AirNet sold its Jetride passenger charter business and thereafter concluded its
month-to-month engagement with BGL. AirNet continues to consult with BGL from time-to-time on
various strategies and opportunities to enhance shareholder value. On February&nbsp;27, 2007, the
AirNet Board dissolved the Strategy Committee following the appointment of Mr.&nbsp;Bruce D. Parker as
Chairman of the Board and his assumption of the position of Chief Executive Officer of AirNet on
December&nbsp;28, 2006.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s air operations are headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. In June&nbsp;2005, AirNet relocated its
operational headquarters from Port Columbus International Airport (&#147;Port Columbus&#148;) to Rickenbacker
International Airport (&#147;Rickenbacker&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet utilizes an extensive screening process to evaluate potential pilots prior to hiring. New
pilots must meet stringent company qualifications, as well as mandated Federal Aviation
Administration (&#147;FAA&#148;) requirements. New pilots must satisfactorily complete a five-week training
program conducted by AirNet&#146;s flight training staff prior to assignment of pilot duties. This
training program includes flight simulator training prior to any actual flight time in an AirNet
aircraft, as well as intensive ground instruction. Additionally, new pilots gain operating
experience in a structured setting prior to assignment in order to gain a familiarity with AirNet&#146;s
route system and the unique demands of the flight environment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s central dispatch system coordinates all components of the air cargo operation. Departure
and arrival times are continuously updated, and weather conditions throughout the nation are
monitored. AirNet dispatchers remain in contact with pilots, out-based hub managers, fuelers,
maintenance technicians and ground delivery personnel to identify and minimize any potential delays
in the delivery process.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Capacity management is an important factor in maintaining profitability of AirNet&#146;s package
delivery services. AirNet&#146;s air transportation network is positioned around a flexible national
route structure designed to facilitate late pick-up and early delivery times, minimize delays and
simplify flight scheduling. AirNet&#146;s flexible route structure allows it to respond to the changing
volume needs of its customers. AirNet&#146;s primary hub in Columbus, Ohio, and several mini-hubs
across the nation, are located primarily in less congested regional airports. These locations, in
conjunction with AirNet&#146;s off-peak departure and arrival times, provide easy take-off and landings,
convenient loading and unloading and fast refueling and maintenance. AirNet also uses commercial
passenger airlines, primarily to transport shipments during the daytime and weekend hours when its
aircraft are operating under a limited flight schedule.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet employs approximately 80 aircraft and avionics technicians in five separate locations across
the United States who perform maintenance on AirNet&#146;s fleet of aircraft. AirNet has an in-house
engine shop at its Columbus facility where some of the piston engines are overhauled on-site,
thereby reducing aircraft downtime and controlling costs. AirNet also performs avionics
troubleshooting and repair at its Columbus facility to provide for maximum efficiency and minimum
aircraft downtime for the fleet. AirNet&#146;s aircraft maintenance center at its Columbus hub has
received ISO 9001:2000 certification and holds a repair station certificate granted by the FAA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Shipment processing</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Bank shipments are pre-sorted by bank customer personnel and packaged in AirNet-supplied bags with
three letter city identifier tags to show final destination. Express shipments are packaged in
either AirNet-provided packaging or the customers&#146; packaging. Shipments transported on AirNet&#146;s
air transportation network are typically picked up by a courier and transported to the local
airport where an airbill is either scanned using bar code technology or entered manually.
Information on each airbill pertaining to the shipper, receiver, airbill number and applicable
deadline is captured and downloaded into AirNet&#146;s computer system, where it is available to
AirNet&#146;s customer service representatives (&#147;CSRs&#148;). Upon arrival at AirNet&#146;s Columbus hub or one
of its mini-hubs, the shipment is off-loaded, sorted by destination and reloaded onto an aircraft.
At the final destination city, the shipment is off-loaded and delivered by courier to the receiver.
When delivered, information from the airbill is once again captured and downloaded into AirNet&#146;s
computer system. Delivery information for all shipments is then available on-line to customers and
AirNet&#146;s CSRs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For banking customers meeting daytime banking deadlines and Express customers requiring
next-flight-out timing, shipments are typically picked up by a courier and transported via
commercial airlines or other integrators to destination cities where couriers recover the packages
and deliver them to their final destinations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Ground support</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet manages its ground delivery services primarily through a network of vendor couriers. The
use of vendor couriers to perform the majority of ground delivery services, allows AirNet to better
match its ground costs with its volume requirements. In limited situations, employees are used for
ground delivery services on scheduled routes where volume requirements economically justify
employing full-time couriers. Dispatching functions related to ground delivery services occur at
AirNet&#146;s Columbus, Ohio hub and on a regional basis in some of the major cities served.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet holds an air carrier operating certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part&nbsp;135 of the
Federal Aviation Regulations. AirNet also holds a repair station certificate granted by the FAA
pursuant to Part&nbsp;145 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. In
addition, until the sale of Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business in September&nbsp;2006, Jetride held
its own air carrier operating certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part&nbsp;135. AirNet&#146;s
certificates are of unlimited duration and remain in effect so long as AirNet maintains the
required standards of safety and meet the operational requirements of the Federal Aviation
Regulations. The FAA&#146;s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air
transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, personnel, and ground facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The U. S. Department of Transportation (&#147;DOT&#148;) and Transportation Security Administration (&#147;TSA&#148;)
have regulatory authority concerning operational and security concerns in transportation, including
safety, insurance and hazardous materials. AirNet holds various operational certificates issued by
these and other governmental agencies, including grantee status to DOT-SP 7060 Special Permit and a
Transport Canada Permit for Equivalent Level of Safety, which permit AirNet to transport higher
volumes of time-critical radioactive pharmaceuticals than is allowed by the DOT and Transport
Canada for most carriers. AirNet&#146;s grantee status under the DOT-SP 7060 Special Permit expires in
August&nbsp;2010 and its Permit for Equivalent Level of Safety expires in March&nbsp;2008. These permits may
be renewed at such times. AirNet is also subject to regulation by the Food and Drug
Administration, which regulates the transportation of pharmaceuticals and live animals, as well as
by various state and local authorities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet believes that it has all permits, approvals and licenses required to conduct its operations
and that it is in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to its operations,
including all applicable noise level regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet transports packages on both its airline and on commercial airlines. The TSA requires that
AirNet maintain certain security programs related to its operations, including a Twelve-Five
Standard Security Program (&#147;TFSSP&#148;) and an Indirect Air Carrier Standard Security Program
(&#147;IACSSP&#148;). The TFSSP governs security procedures applicable to AirNet&#146;s airline and the IACSSP
governs security procedures for tendering packages to commercial airlines. AirNet maintains a TSA
approved TFSSP. AirNet Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AirNet (&#147;AirNet
Management&#148;), maintains a TSA approved IACSSP. AirNet and AirNet Management believe that they are
in compliance with all the requirements of the TFSSP and IACSSP programs that they maintain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of increased concerns regarding airline security, in May&nbsp;2006 the TSA adopted new rules
and regulations to enhance the security requirements relating to the transportation of cargo on
both passenger and all-cargo aircraft. These new rules, when fully implemented, will require air
carriers maintaining TFSSP and IACSSP programs to institute new or additional security measures,
including enhanced training of personnel responsible for maintaining such programs or involved in
the processing of air cargo, more extensive background checks of such personnel, and new rules for
verifying the identity of shippers and individuals tendering packages to commercial airlines.
AirNet has implemented the new TSA rules and regulations that are currently in effect and intends
to implement other security measures as they become effective.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;9, 2007, the United States House of Representatives passed bill H.R.1 entitled
&#147;Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007&#148; and the bill was received in the
United States Senate and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
On March&nbsp;5, 2007, the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the United States Senate
reported bill S.509 entitled &#147;Aviation Security Improvement Act&#148; with amendments and the bill as
amended was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar. If enacted, each of these bills would
provide for significant further regulation and inspection/screening of cargo transported on
commercial passenger airlines. If these bills are enacted, commercial passenger airlines may
require earlier tendering times which may impact AirNet&#146;s ability to meet current shipping
timeframes for its customers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The air and ground courier industry is highly competitive. AirNet&#146;s primary competitor in the
transportation of cancelled checks is the Federal Reserve&#146;s Check Relay Network (the &#147;CRN&#148;). The
actions of the Federal Reserve are regulated by the Monetary Control Act, which requires the
Federal Reserve to price its services at actual cost plus a set percentage private sector
adjustment factor. AirNet believes that the purpose of the Monetary Control Act is to curtail the
possibility of predatory pricing by the Federal Reserve when it competes with the private sector.
No assurance beyond the remedies of law can be given that the Federal Reserve will comply with the
Monetary Control Act. On February&nbsp;13, 2007,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">announced that on May&nbsp;21, 2007 it
would be significantly reducing the number of interdistrict flights on its CRN as a result of a
significant decline in the volume of cancelled checks to be transported. The Federal Reserve also
announced that it expects the CRN will be discontinued by
2010.<br><br>
In the private sector, there are a large number of smaller, regional carriers that transport
cancelled checks, none of which AirNet believes has a significant interstate market share. The two
largest private sector national air carriers, FedEx and United Parcel Service (&#147;UPS&#148;), both carry
cancelled checks where the required deadlines fit into their existing system. AirNet does not
believe that FedEx or UPS represents a significant competitor in the time-critical cancelled check
market to
date. AirNet provides customized service for its customer base, often with later pick-ups and
earlier deliveries than the large, national air carriers provide.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet competes with commercial passenger airlines and numerous other carriers in its Express
Services delivery business and estimates its market share in this industry at less than 1%. AirNet
believes that its national air transportation network, proprietary information technology and
historically high on-time performance level allow it to compete in this market. In recent years,
additional charter aircraft competitors have received grantee status to the DOT-SP 7060 Special
Permit which has increased competition for radioactive pharmaceuticals customers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2004, AirNet commenced construction of a new corporate and operational facility (the
&#147;Rickenbacker Facility&#148;) on land leased from the Columbus Regional Airport Authority (the
&#147;Authority&#148;). Construction of the Rickenbacker Facility was completed in May of 2005 and AirNet
completed the relocation of its flight and administrative operations to the Rickenbacker Facility
in June of 2005. Portions of the leased land on which the Rickenbacker Facility was constructed,
as well as portions of the aircraft ramp used by AirNet at the Rickenbacker Facility, contain known
pollution conditions. The appropriate amended post closure plan and no further action letters
addressing the Rickenbacker Facility and the aircraft ramp were obtained by AirNet from the
Authority prior to beginning construction. No additional pollution conditions on the leased land
were noted during construction of the Rickenbacker Facility or the aircraft ramp and none have been
noted through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2005, AirNet relocated its corporate and operational headquarters from 3939 International
Gateway in Columbus, Ohio (the &#147;Port Columbus Facility&#148;) to the new Rickenbacker Facility.
AirNet&#146;s lease of its Port Columbus Facility expired on August&nbsp;31, 2005. In connection with
vacating its Port Columbus Facility, AirNet was required to conduct an environmental assessment of
the Port Columbus Facility. The results of the environmental assessment demonstrated
concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons and vinyl chloride above the regulatory limits in samples
associated with one of three oil-water separators located in the hanger portion of the Port
Columbus Facility. Except for the area associated with the one oil-water separator, it was the
opinion of the environmental testing firm engaged to conduct the assessment that no obviously
recognized environmental conditions existed at AirNet&#146;s Port Columbus Facility in the areas
assessed, including the fuel farm which AirNet maintained at the Port Columbus Facility through
August&nbsp;2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Following completion of the environmental assessment of the Port Columbus Facility, AirNet, with
the assistance of the Authority, determined what actions were necessary to remediate the identified
pollution conditions. In March of 2006, AirNet completed remedial work to remove the pollution
conditions, which consisted primarily of the removal and replacement of a portion of the concrete
floor in the hangar area of the Port Columbus Facility, the removal and replacement of the
contaminated soil, and the installation of a new oil-water separator. Environmental testing
conducted upon the completion of the remedial work demonstrated no presence of petroleum
hydrocarbons or vinyl chloride above the regulatory limits in the area associated with the remedial
work.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet also maintained certain assets at Port Columbus for dispensing aviation fuel under the terms
and conditions of a separate lease agreement (the &#147;Fuel Farm Lease&#148;). The Fuel Farm Lease required
AirNet to return the premises leased under the Fuel Farm Lease to their original condition upon the
termination of the lease. In lieu of returning the premises to their original condition, the Fuel
Farm Lease provided that the Authority could take title to any improvements constructed by AirNet
on the leased premises. On August&nbsp;17, 2006, AirNet conveyed all of its fuel farm assets to the
Authority for $1 and a release of any future liabilities associated with the Fuel Farm Lease and
the fuel farm assets, other than any liabilities related to environmental conditions which may be
imposed by any governmental agency. The Fuel Farm Lease also was terminated on August&nbsp;17, 2006.
As a result of the conveyance of the fuel farm assets to the Authority and the termination of the
Fuel Farm Lease, AirNet was relieved of its obligation to return the leased premises to their
original condition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet believes that compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing environmental
matters has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on AirNet&#146;s capital
expenditures, operations or competitive position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet employed approximately 670 persons, which included approximately
170 pilots. AirNet&#146;s employees are not represented by any union or covered by any collective
bargaining agreement. AirNet has experienced no work stoppages and believes that its relationship
with employees is good.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Check 21 Act and electronic methods of clearing cancelled checks have had, and will continue to
have, a significant adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s revenues derived from check delivery services.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Check 21 Act, which became effective in October&nbsp;2004, creates a new negotiable instrument
called a substitute check (also known as an image replaced document or &#147;IRD&#148;) that becomes the
legal equivalent of the original item. The Check 21 Act effectively removed the requirement of
returning an original paper check to the account holder&#146;s institution and required that all
financial institutions accept an IRD in lieu of a cancelled check. The Check 21 Act and the
transition in the banking industry to electronic methods of clearing cancelled checks will
eventually replace the need for expedited air transportation services of original cancelled checks
by most of AirNet&#146;s banking customers. The Check 21 Act and electronic methods of clearing
cancelled checks have had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse affect on AirNet&#146;s
revenues derived from check delivery services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The use of image replacement documents and other electronic methods to clear cancelled checks is
accelerating and will have a significant adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s revenues and income.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The use of IRD&#146;s and other electronic methods to clear cancelled checks is accelerating and AirNet
is experiencing significant declines in the volume of cancelled checks it delivers. The
acceleration in the use of electronic methods of clearing checks will have a significant adverse
effect on AirNet&#146;s revenues and income. AirNet&#146;s contribution margin on the delivery of cancelled
checks is significantly higher than its contribution margin from its other delivery services. The
decline in revenues derived from check delivery services and the associated loss of contribution
margin will require AirNet to further reduce its current route structure and the number of aircraft
it operates. Such reductions in AirNet&#146;s national airline network will result in the elimination
of certain delivery services to its banking customers and will result in additional declines in
AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues. The high fixed costs of AirNet&#146;s national airline structure will
make it difficult to reduce costs in proportion to anticipated decreases in revenues and income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>AirNet
may be unable to offset losses in its Bank Services revenues and contribution margins with
Express Services revenues and contribution margins, which could adversely affect AirNet&#146;s
profitability or ability to operate its air transportation network.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because the density of cancelled check shipments is greater than the typical Express Services
shipment, contribution margins on Bank Services shipments are substantially higher than Express
Services shipments after considering the cubic dimension of shipments. Also, due to the
unscheduled nature of Express Services shipments, pick-up and delivery costs per shipment are
higher for Express Services shipments than Bank Services shipments. Express Services contribution
margins are currently insufficient to support the operation of AirNet&#146;s airline as presently
configured. As AirNet&#146;s Bank Services revenues decline due to the decrease in cancelled check
volumes, it will be necessary for AirNet to increase its Express Services revenues and contribution
margins to a level sufficient to support the operating costs of AirNet&#146;s airline. In the event
AirNet is unable to sufficiently increase its Express Services revenues and contribution margins,
it will be necessary to restructure AirNet&#146;s airline by reducing routes and the number of aircraft
its operates. Due to the high fixed costs of operating AirNet&#146;s national air transportation
network, there can be no assurances that AirNet&#146;s financial performance in future periods will be
profitable or sufficient to support a national air transportation network.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Reductions in AirNet&#146;s route schedule and the number of aircraft it operates may adversely impact
AirNet&#146;s Express Services business.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s air and ground network that provides later pick-up and earlier delivery times than those
offered by other national carriers is one of the primary differentiating characteristics of
AirNet&#146;s time-critical delivery network. A significant portion of AirNet&#146;s Express Services
shipments are transported on AirNet&#146;s airline. The anticipated decline in AirNet&#146;s transportation
of cancelled checks will require significant changes in AirNet&#146;s air transportation network,
including further reductions in its current route schedule and the number of aircraft it operates.
Reductions in AirNet&#146;s route schedule and the number of aircraft it operates will require AirNet to
transport a greater portion of its Express Services shipments on commercial airlines and may
adversely impact AirNet&#146;s ability to expand or maintain its Express Services business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Competition from other providers of express air and ground delivery services may adversely affect
AirNet&#146;s results of operations and financial condition.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s Bank Services compete primarily against the Federal Reserve&#146;s Check Relay Network, which
has significantly greater financial and other resources than AirNet. The Federal Reserve is
regulated by the Monetary Control Act of 1980, which in general requires that the Federal Reserve
price its services on an actual cost basis plus a set percentage private

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">sector market adjustment
factor. Failure by the Federal Reserve to comply with the Monetary Control Act by pricing its
services below the required rates could have an adverse competitive impact on AirNet. In addition,
the Monetary Control Act may be amended, modified or repealed, or new legislation affecting
AirNet&#146;s business may be enacted. Also, the market for Express Services is highly competitive.
Aggressive competition for customers with express delivery needs could have a material adverse
affect on revenue and contribution margins in Express Services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>It will be difficult for AirNet to dispose of its aircraft and other operating assets in response
to any reductions in its air transportation network or operations.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s ability to dispose of its aircraft in response to any reductions in its air transportation
network will be limited by the age and cargo configuration of such aircraft. AirNet&#146;s aircraft,
including its Learjets, are relatively older, higher use aircraft that are not configured for
passenger use. Lower use Learjets with similar ages, lower operating hours and configured for
passenger use have been averaging in excess of 18&nbsp;months on the market prior to sale. AirNet&#146;s
ability to dispose of its Learjets will be restricted by such market factors and may require
extended holding periods prior to sale. The cost of converting such Learjets to passenger use will
also limit the market for such aircraft and the value AirNet would receive upon their sale. A
significant portion of AirNet&#146;s other aircraft are subject to similar factors that will limit their
marketability. AirNet&#146;s operating facility located at Rickenbacker International Airport is a
specialty use facility which is not readily adaptable to uses other than aircraft operations. The
specialty nature of AirNet&#146;s Rickenbacker facility and the fact that it is not located at a major
metropolitan airport will limit its value and could result in an extended holding period prior to
disposition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Government regulation significantly affects AirNet.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s delivery operations are subject to various federal, state and local regulations that in
many instances require permits and licenses. Failure by AirNet to maintain required permits or
licenses, or to comply with the applicable regulations, could result in substantial fines or
possible revocation of AirNet&#146;s authority to conduct certain of its operations. AirNet&#146;s flight
operations are regulated by the FAA under Part&nbsp;135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Among
other things, these regulations govern permissible flight and duty time for aviation flight crews.
The FAA has contemplated, from time to time, certain changes in flight and duty time guidelines
which, if adopted, could increase AirNet&#146;s operating costs. These changes, if adopted, could also
require AirNet and other operators regulated by the FAA to hire additional flight crew personnel.
In addition, Congress, from time to time, has considered various means, including excise taxes, to
raise revenues directly from the airline industry to pay for air traffic control facilities and
personnel. There can be no assurances that Congress will not change the current federal excise tax
rate or enact new excise taxes, which could adversely affect AirNet&#146;s business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>FAA grounding of AirNet&#146;s fleet or a specific type of aircraft used in AirNet&#146;s delivery services
business may adversely affect AirNet&#146;s business and revenues.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The FAA has the authority to ground specific types of aircraft due to safety concerns and ground a
Part&nbsp;135 operator&#146;s entire fleet for alleged violations of safety requirements. The FAA has, from
time to time, grounded specific types of aircraft until such aircraft can be inspected and/or can
be modified to correct the safety issue. The FAA has considered airworthiness directives that
could result in the grounding of certain Cessna 208 Caravans until de-icing equipment or other
modifications can be installed. AirNet operates 14 Cessna 208
Caravans as part of its air transportation network. The grounding of any type of aircraft used in AirNet&#146;s fleet, including the Cessna 208
Caravans, would adversely affect AirNet&#146;s air transportation network and would adversely affect
AirNet&#146;s business and revenues. In addition, the cost of modifying AirNet&#146;s aircraft to correct
any safety concerns would increase the cost of operating such aircraft and AirNet&#146;s business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Loss of AirNet Management, Inc.&#146;s Indirect Air Carrier Standard Security Program approval could
adversely affect AirNet&#146;s business.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A
significant portion of AirNet&#146;s shipments are transported via
commercial passenger airlines. TSA
regulations provide that only indirect air carriers that maintain a TSA-approved Indirect Air
Carrier Standard Security Program (&#147;IACSSP&#148;) may tender packages to commercial passenger airlines. AirNet
Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AirNet (&#147;AirNet Management&#148;), maintains a
TSA-approved IACSSP under which AirNet derives its authority to tender packages to commercial
passenger airlines. AirNet&#146;s ability to transport packages on commercial passenger airlines is dependent upon AirNet
Management&#146;s continuing compliance with the rules and regulations governing Indirect Air Carrier
Standard Security Programs and the TSA&#146;s continuing approval of the AirNet Management IACSSP. The
TSA has, from time to time, implemented new rules and regulations governing the tender of packages
to commercial passenger airlines. In addition, the US House and Senate are considering new
legislation which, if enacted, would further increase the regulation of air cargo on commercial
passenger aircraft. Such new regulations and legislation could increase AirNet&#146;s operating costs
or make it more difficult to comply with the rules and regulations governing the tender of packages
to commercial passenger airlines. The loss of AirNet Management&#146;s IACSSP approval would have a
significant and immediate adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s business.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The DOT implemented new regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials that went
into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2005. The new regulations required that AirNet institute new operating
procedures and make arrangements with ground vendors and/or fixed based operators to assist AirNet
in complying with the new regulations. Failure to comply with the new or existing regulations
governing the transportation of hazardous materials would reduce or otherwise restrict AirNet&#146;s
ability to transport hazardous materials, including its ability to transport radioactive
pharmaceuticals pursuant to AirNet&#146;s grantee status under the DOT SP-7060 Special Permit. Future
changes in government regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials may also
increase AirNet&#146;s costs of transporting such shipments or reduce AirNet&#146;s ability to transport such
shipments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Reclassification of ground couriers as employees rather than independent contractors could subject
AirNet to back taxes and other liabilities.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to 2006, AirNet used the services of independent contractors as couriers to pick up and
deliver a significant portion of its packages. From time to time, federal and state authorities
have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation industry, including
independent contractors providing services similar to those utilized by AirNet, are employees
rather than independent contractors. AirNet previously classified its couriers providing services
under an independent contractor agreement or arrangement as independent contractors rather than as
employees. However, there can be no assurance that federal or state authorities will not challenge
this position and attempt to reclassify such independent contractors as employees of AirNet. In the
event of any such reclassification, AirNet could be required to pay back-up withholding with
respect to amounts previously paid to its couriers and be required to pay penalties or subject
AirNet to other liabilities as a result of the incorrect classification of such individuals, such
as payment of past due workers compensation and unemployment insurance premiums.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Changes to current transportation security requirements or procedures could adversely impact
AirNet&#146;s ability to efficiently conduct AirNet&#146;s air and ground operations to meet AirNet&#146;s current
delivery parameters or significantly increase costs to transact those operations.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Considerable focus has been placed on package security requirements and procedures at domestic and
international airports since the September&nbsp;11, 2001 tragedy and related incidents. The TSA,
commercial airlines, fixed based operations (where AirNet transacts a significant portion of its
aircraft loading and unloading operations) and airport authorities are still in the process of
reviewing and improving all aspects of their security requirements. While many proposed changes
are voluntary, many are being mandated by the TSA, the DOT and the FAA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2002, the TSA implemented screening procedures for over-the-counter cargo tendered to
commercial airlines. These screening procedures have resulted in additional tender time for
packages transported on the commercial airlines in certain locations and during certain times. In
addition, the TSA continues to review and consider additional package screening requirements and
changes to the vendor screening procedures, which AirNet may need to perform on packages from its
customers. Many commercial airlines are also adding security surcharges to shipments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Changes at fixed base operators and by local airport authorities could potentially limit AirNet&#146;s
ramp access to its aircraft, thereby increasing tender time from customers. Changes in chain of
custody requirements could also potentially cause AirNet to incur additional costs to staff
additional hours at certain locations. In response to the new security-related procedures being
implemented, AirNet added a security surcharge in 2002 for its Bank Services and Express Services
customers. Although the surcharge is expected to help offset the increasing costs associated with
security issues, AirNet&#146;s current surcharge program may not be sufficient to cover all new costs it
may incur as additional transportation safety procedures are developed and/or required.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a company actively engaged in providing aviation services, AirNet is subject to current and
future regulations with which it must comply in order to maintain its ability to provide such
services. Various governmental agencies are implementing and expanding policies, procedures, and
compliance measures to enhance the safety and security of both domestic and international air
transportation. This increasing regulatory environment may require AirNet to change its
operational processes, modify its flight schedules, and incur additional costs of compliance. The
costs associated with regulatory compliance could impact AirNet&#146;s financial results. AirNet&#146;s
inability to comply with current or future governmental regulations could limit or restrict
AirNet&#146;s ability to provide specific services, including but not limited to, the transportation of
hazardous materials.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005, AirNet completed construction of its Rickenbacker Facility on land leased from the
Authority. Portions of the leased land, as well as portions of the aircraft ramp, on which AirNet
conducts a significant portion of its operations at the Rickenbacker Facility, contain known
pollution conditions. The appropriate amended post closure plan and no further action letters
addressing these areas were supplied to AirNet by the Authority prior to beginning construction.
Identification of additional pollution conditions on the leased land or attached ramp could
increase AirNet&#146;s costs and have an adverse affect on its ability to operate at the Rickenbacker
Facility.

Canada Permit for Equivalent Level of Safety would result in significant loss of Express Services

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet maintains grantee status to the DOT-SP 7060 Special Permit and holds a Transport Canada
Permit for Equivalent Level of Safety which allows AirNet to transport higher volumes of
radioactive pharmaceuticals than that permitted by most air carriers. AirNet&#146;s grantee status
under the DOT-SP 7060 Special Permit expires in August&nbsp;2010 and its Permit for Equivalent Level of
Safety expires on March&nbsp;31, 2008. Although AirNet anticipates it will obtain a renewal of these
permits at their next scheduled renewal dates, there can be no assurances that these permits will
be extended. Further, there can be no assurance that AirNet can continue to comply with all
current requirements related to its grantee status under the DOT-SP 7060 Special Permit or its
Permit for Equivalent Level of Safety, or that such requirements will not change in the future
which would negatively affect AirNet&#146;s ability to maintain such status.

third party.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Provisions of AirNet&#146;s amended articles and code of regulations and of the Ohio Revised Code,
together or separately, could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change
in control of AirNet and limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the
future for the common shares. Among other things, these provisions require certain supermajority
votes, establish advance notice procedures for shareholder nomination of candidates for election as
directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders&#146; meetings, eliminate
cumulative voting in the election of directors and provide that directors may only be removed from
office for cause.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s amended articles authorize the board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 preferred
shares without further shareholder approval, subject to any limitations prescribed by law and the
rules and regulations of AMEX. The preferred shares could have dividend, liquidation, conversion
and other rights and privileges that are superior or senior to the common shares. Issuance of
preferred shares could result in the dilution of the voting power of the common shares, adversely
affect holders of the common shares in the event of liquidation of AirNet or delay, defer or
prevent a change in control of AirNet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, Section&nbsp;1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code contains provisions that require shareholder
approval of any proposed &#147;control share acquisition&#148; of any Ohio corporation at any of three voting
power thresholds: one-fifth, one-third and a majority. Further, Chapter&nbsp;1704 of the Ohio Revised
Code contains provisions that restrict specified business combinations and other transactions
between an Ohio corporation and interested shareholders.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet has a significant revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire on October&nbsp;15,
2008. AirNet&#146;s revolving credit facility is used to fund working capital, capital expenditures and
other general corporate requirements. Any substantial indebtedness incurred under the revolving
credit facility could: (1)&nbsp;require AirNet to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from
operating activities to payments on AirNet&#146;s indebtedness, which would reduce the cash flows
available to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;
(2)&nbsp;limit AirNet&#146;s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in AirNet&#146;s business and
the industry in which AirNet operates; and (3)&nbsp;limit AirNet&#146;s ability to borrow additional funds.
AirNet&#146;s liquidity and its ability to meet its current and long-term financial obligations as they
become due will be dependent upon AirNet&#146;s financial performance, its ability to meet financial
covenants under the revolving credit facility and its ability to replace or extend the revolving
credit facility when it becomes due. AirNet&#146;s breach of a financial covenant or other provision of
its revolving credit facility would constitute a default and would permit its lender to pursue the
remedies available to it under the revolving credit facility. These remedies include terminating
AirNet&#146;s ability to make any new borrowings and accelerating the repayment of all existing
borrowings under the revolving credit facility. If AirNet&#146;s lender declared a default, there is no
assurance that AirNet would have adequate resources or be able to obtain other financing to pay
amounts owed under the revolving credit facility. AirNet&#146;s failure to meet these financial
covenants would have a material adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s financial position and ability to
continue operations.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet is in the process of documenting and testing its internal control over financial reporting
in order to satisfy the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which will
require management to annually assess the
effectiveness of AirNet&#146;s internal control over financial reporting beginning with the fiscal year
ending December&nbsp;31, 2007 and a report by AirNet&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm
addressing management&#146;s assessment and the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting beginning with the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2008. During the course of AirNet&#146;s
testing, AirNet may identify deficiencies and weaknesses, which AirNet may not be able to remediate
in time to meet the deadline imposed by the regulations promulgated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
for compliance with the requirements for Section&nbsp;404. If management is unable to conclude that
AirNet&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is effective at year-end 2007 or AirNet&#146;s
independent registered public accounting firm is unable to give a favorable report on management&#146;s
assessment beginning with the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2008, the result could be a material
adverse effect on AirNet&#146;s reputation, financial condition and on the market price of AirNet&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;20, 2004, AirNet entered into a land lease with the Authority to lease approximately 8
acres located within Rickenbacker. AirNet completed construction of its new Rickenbacker Facility
in May&nbsp;2005 and AirNet&#146;s relocation to the Rickenbacker Facility was completed in June&nbsp;2005.
AirNet&#146;s corporate and operational functions that were previously conducted at the Port Columbus
Facility and the administrative functions previously conducted at 555 Morrison Road in Gahanna,
Ohio were consolidated at the new Rickenbacker Facility. Rickenbacker is located in Franklin and
Pickaway Counties, Ohio, southeast of Columbus, Ohio, approximately fifteen miles from AirNet&#146;s
former Port Columbus Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;20, 2004, in anticipation of AirNet&#146;s move to its new Rickenbacker Facility, AirNet also
entered into an agreement to sell its Port Columbus Facility to the Authority for $3.9&nbsp;million.
Closing of the sale of the Port Columbus Facility to the Authority took place on December&nbsp;15, 2004.
Concurrently with the sale, AirNet entered into a new lease agreement with the Authority (the &#147;New
Port Columbus Lease&#148;) pursuant to which AirNet leased the real property associated with the Port
Columbus Facility and the buildings and all other improvements thereon pending AirNet&#146;s relocation
to its Rickenbacker Facility. The New Port Columbus Lease expired on August&nbsp;31, 2005. In
connection with vacating its Port Columbus Facility, AirNet was required to return certain portions
of the premises to their prior condition. The remedial work required to return the Port Columbus
Facility to its prior condition, except for the environmental work discussed below, was completed
by December&nbsp;31, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the termination of the New Port Columbus Lease, the Authority required that
AirNet conduct an environmental assessment of the Port Columbus Facility, including the underground
storage tanks associated with AirNet&#146;s fuel farm operation. The objective of the environmental
assessment was to determine and quantify any environmental impact AirNet&#146;s operations may have had
at the Port Columbus Facility. The results of the environmental sampling demonstrated
concentrations above the regulatory limits for petroleum hydrocarbons and vinyl chloride in samples
associated with one of three oil-water separators located in the hanger portion of the Port
Columbus Facility. AirNet completed certain remedial work in connection with the pollution
conditions in March of 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Through August&nbsp;2006, AirNet also maintained certain assets at Port Columbus for dispensing aviation
fuel under the terms and conditions of a separate lease agreement (the &#147;Fuel Farm Lease&#148;). The
Fuel Farm Lease required AirNet to return the premises leased under the Fuel Farm Lease to their
original condition upon the termination of the lease. In lieu of returning the premises to their
original condition, the Fuel Farm Lease provided that the Authority could take title to any
improvements constructed by AirNet on the leased premises. On August&nbsp;17, 2006, AirNet conveyed all
of its fuel farm assets to the Authority for $1 and a release of any future liabilities associated
with the Fuel Farm Lease and the fuel farm assets, other than any liabilities related to
environmental conditions which may be imposed by any governmental agency. The Fuel Farm Lease also
was terminated on August&nbsp;17, 2006. As a result of the conveyance of the fuel farm assets to the
Authority and the termination of the Fuel Farm Lease, AirNet was relieved of its obligation to
return the leased premises to their original condition.

AirNet decided to market for sale all nine of the Cessna 310 aircraft it owns and, in November
2006, AirNet entered into an agreement to sell all nine of the Cessna 310 aircraft for
approximately $0.4&nbsp;million. AirNet agreed to perform an annual inspection and to pay the cost of
the inspection for each aircraft prior to delivery. AirNet delivered six aircraft in the first

third party provider and began replacing owned vehicles with leased vehicles as replacement became
necessary. AirNet leased approximately 17 of the 50 ground transportation vehicles it operated as
of December&nbsp;31, 2006. In addition to the ground transportation vehicles it operates, AirNet owns
and operates approximately 24 vehicles not licensed for road use, including fuel trucks and tugs.

publishers indicating that the association had evidence that AirNet had engaged in the unlawful
installation and use of certain software products. At the request of the association&#146;s attorney,
AirNet conducted a company wide review of its use of software published by members

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">of the
association. The internal review did not disclose any unauthorized installation or use of such
software and the results of the review were submitted to the association&#146;s attorney. The attorney
for the association subsequently requested certain supplemental information regarding AirNet&#146;s
software usage, which AirNet supplied to the attorney for the association. In March&nbsp;2007, the
attorney for the association notified AirNet that she was not able to verify AirNet&#146;s possession of
licenses for certain software through information provided by the manufacturers of such software.
The attorney for the association offered to settle the alleged infringement issues in accordance
with terms of a proposed settlement agreement and a settlement payment of approximately $26,000.
The attorney for the association has confirmed that AirNet may still submit appropriate
documentation reflecting its purchase of the software in question. AirNet is in the process of
assembling and submitting such documentation. AirNet believes that it is in compliance with all
software licensing requirements and that it has not engaged in any unlawful use of the software
published by the association&#146;s members.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet uses the services of independent contractors as couriers to pick up and deliver its
packages. During 2005, the California Employment Development Department (the &#147;EDD&#148;) concluded an
employment tax audit of AirNet&#146;s operations in
California. As a result of its audit, the EDD concluded that certain independent contractors used
by AirNet should be reclassified as employees. Based upon such reclassification, the EDD proposed a
$53,061 assessment against AirNet under Section&nbsp;1127 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code.
After receipt of the proposed assessment, AirNet filed a Petition for Reassessment with the
California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. After the filing of the Petition for Reassessment,
AirNet submitted further documentation to the EDD which reduced the assessment to $31,636 based
upon employment taxes paid directly to the State of California by the affected independent
contractors. On February&nbsp;13, 2007, AirNet withdrew its petition for reassessment. Payment of the
EDD assessment will conclude this matter.

subsidiaries other than routine litigation incidental to their respective business. In the opinion

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>General</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total net revenues have increased in each of the last three years as a result of increases in
Express Services revenues, higher fuel surcharge revenues and general price increases for Bank
Services and Express Services. However, AirNet&#146;s Bank Services net revenues, the largest portion
of AirNet&#146;s business, began to decline in 2006 as a result of the increasing use of image products
and other electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks. Management
believes the decline in Bank Services revenues will continue in future periods due to decreasing
demand for the physical transportation of cancelled checks. The decline in Bank Services check
volume and revenues will require AirNet to focus on increasing its Express Services revenues and to
restructure its existing transportation network to meet the changing needs of Bank Services and
Express Services customers. AirNet&#146;s transportation network was originally designed and continues
to operate in a highly reliable manner to meet the demanding pick-up and delivery schedules of
AirNet&#146;s bank customers with aircraft that have relatively small cargo capacities. The present
AirNet fleet is capable of accepting relatively small sized Express Services cargo; however, the
aircraft are not readily adaptable to the transportation of many other types of larger air cargo,
which generally require greater aircraft capacity and have lower operating costs per pound mile.
AirNet continues to evaluate and review Bank Services and Express Services customer needs and
AirNet&#146;s operating structure and costs. Management anticipates that it will be necessary to
substantially modify its transportation network and fleet in response to these changing business
conditions, including the evaluation of different aircraft types that may be more suitable for
Express Services customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following management&#146;s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the
results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, as well as the critical accounting policies
of AirNet. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited
consolidated financial statements, which include additional information about AirNet&#146;s significant
accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie its financial results, and the
risk factors described in &#147;Item&nbsp;1A &#150; Risk Factors&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Sale of Jetride&#146;s Passenger Charter Business</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;26, 2006, AirNet, Jetride, and Pinnacle Air, LLC (&#147;Pinnacle&#148;) entered into a purchase
agreement regarding the sale of Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business to Pinnacle (the &#147;Purchase
Agreement&#148;). The sale was completed on September&nbsp;26, 2006. The purchase price was $41.0&nbsp;million
in cash, of which $40.0&nbsp;million was consideration for the sale of nine company-owned aircraft and
related engine maintenance programs and $1.0&nbsp;million was consideration for the sale of all of the
outstanding capital stock of a newly-created subsidiary of Jetride, also called Jetride, Inc. (&#147;New
Jetride&#148;). Upon completion of the sale transaction, Jetride amended its articles of incorporation
to change its name to 7250 STARCHECK, INC. Of the total consideration, $40.0&nbsp;million was paid at
closing and $1.0&nbsp;million was paid into escrow to cover indemnification claims which may be made by
Pinnacle for up to eighteen months after the closing. To the extent the escrow amount is not used
to satisfy indemnification claims, the escrow amount is to be released to AirNet in two
installments approximately six and twelve months after the closing. In March&nbsp;2007, $500,000 of the
escrowed amount was released to AirNet. AirNet retained the net working capital of the Jetride
passenger charter business, which was approximately $2.2&nbsp;million as of the closing date. In
connection with the closing of the sale transaction, Jetride repaid in full six term loans which
had been secured by aircraft used in Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business. The aggregate principal
amount of the loans repaid was approximately $28.2&nbsp;million plus accrued interest and early
termination prepayment penalties of approximately $0.3&nbsp;million through the repayment date.
Following repayment of Jetride&#146;s loans and expenses related to the transaction, AirNet used the
remaining sale proceeds to further reduce debt outstanding under AirNet&#146;s secured revolving credit
facility. AirNet&#146;s lenders under the secured revolving credit facility had consented to the sale
of the Jetride passenger charter business and the various transactions necessary to complete the
sale.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the transaction, AirNet agreed to provide certain transition services to
Pinnacle and its subsidiaries for various specified time periods and various monthly fees, which
initially aggregate to approximately $37,500 per month, primarily for aircraft maintenance
services. In addition, AirNet&#146;s Director of Maintenance continues to serve as the Director of
Maintenance for New Jetride. AirNet entered into three subleases with New Jetride, each for a one
year term, under which New Jetride leases a portion of AirNet&#146;s facilities located at Rickenbacker
International Airport, Dallas Love Field and Birmingham International Airport. The aggregate lease
payment under the three subleases is approximately $10,000 per month.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pinnacle made offers of employment to all of the employees of Jetride and substantially all of the
Jetride pilots and other employees accepted employment with Pinnacle. Wynn D. Peterson, who had
served as AirNet&#146;s Senior Vice President, Jetride Services, resigned as an executive officer of
AirNet to become President of Pinnacle and New Jetride, which became a subsidiary of Pinnacle upon
completion of the sale transaction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from Passenger Charter Services, included in discontinued operations, were approximately
$16.9&nbsp;million, $29.5&nbsp;million and $18.5&nbsp;million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income from
discontinued operations before income taxes for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $0.1&nbsp;million,
$0.8&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million, respectively. Included in the 2006

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">income from discontinued

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Although Bank Services revenues declined in 2006 due to a decrease in cancelled check volumes,
AirNet&#146;s total net revenues have increased in each of the last three years as a result of increases
in Express Services revenues, higher fuel surcharge revenues and general price increases for both
Bank Services and Express Services. Bank Services revenues and Express Services revenues are
presented net of federal excise tax fees which were approximately 2% for Bank Services revenues and
approximately 3% for Express Services revenues in each of the periods presented.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet generally assesses its Bank Services customers a fuel surcharge, which is generally based on
the Oil Price Index Summary &#150; Columbus, Ohio (OPIS)&nbsp;index. AirNet also assesses most of its
Express Services customers a fuel surcharge based on the OPIS index, which is adjusted monthly
based on changes in the OPIS index. As index rates fluctuate above a set threshold, surcharge
rates will increase or decrease accordingly. The fuel surcharge rate is applied to the revenue
amount billed to Bank Services and Express Services customers. AirNet assesses certain Express
customers fuel surcharges based on negotiated contractual rates. The average annual fuel price on
the OPIS index increased approximately 13% in 2006. Fuel surcharge revenues for Bank Services and
Express Services in 2006 exceeded the comparable amounts in 2005 by approximately $5.6&nbsp;million, or
30%. The average annual fuel price on the OPIS index increased approximately 43% in 2005. Fuel
surcharge revenues for Bank Services and Express Services in 2005 exceeded the comparable amounts
in 2004 by approximately $10.2&nbsp;million, or 126%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management believes Bank Services fuel surcharge revenues in 2007 will decline from 2006 amounts
because of declining Bank Services revenues and because it believes that it is unlikely that fuel
prices in 2007 will exceed the sustained high level of fuel prices experienced in 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There were 199 flying days in 2006 and 2005, and 201 flying days in 2004. There were 52
weekends in 2006 and 2005, and 51&nbsp;weekends in 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Bank Services shipments consist primarily of cancelled checks (checks processed for settlement),
proof of deposit (unprocessed checks) and interoffice mail delivery. These shipments are
transported on AirNet&#146;s transportation network and, to a lesser extent, on commercial passenger
airlines and dedicated AirNet aircraft charters for specific banks. Total Net Bank Services
revenues decreased in 2006 from 2005 due to, but at a lesser rate than, the decrease in total Bank
Services pounds shipped per flying day. Cancelled check pounds shipped per flying day declined
approximately 13% in 2006 from 2005. An increase in proof of deposit and interoffice mail
deliveries partially offset this decline, resulting in a net decrease in total Bank Services pounds
shipped per flying day of approximately 10% in 2006 from 2005. The 10% net decline in pounds
shipped per flying day resulted in a 4% decline in Bank Services revenues. Bank Services cancelled
check pounds shipped per flying day declined in each quarter of 2006 at an increasing
year-over-year rate. Cancelled check pounds shipped per flying day declined in each quarter of
2006 by approximately 7%, 9%, 16% and 24% when compared to the respective quarter of 2005. AirNet
expects this trend to continue in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Primarily as a result of the decline in cancelled check volumes, AirNet&#146;s weekday revenues per
flying day, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 4% in 2006 compared to 2005. In the
fourth quarter of 2006, weekday revenues per flying day, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased
approximately 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. This decline was partially offset by a
19% increase in fuel surcharge revenues. AirNet expects Bank Services revenues will continue to
decline in 2007 as a result of continued reductions in cancelled check volume and as a result of
the planned significant reduction in the number of flights conducted by AirNet&#146;s air transportation
network, as described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The expected decline in cancelled check volumes is attributable to general decreases in shipment
weights and periodic cancellations of certain dispatches or other portions of the air
transportation services AirNet provides to its banking customers. During 2006, as a result of
decreased demand for air transportation services, AirNet received a number of service cancellations
from its banking customers. These cancellations, which took effect at various times throughout
2006, did not impact AirNet&#146;s 2006 banking revenues on a full year basis. AirNet has also received
additional service cancellations from its banking customers which become effective in the first
quarter of 2007, which represented approximately $4.0&nbsp;million of revenues on an annual basis in
2006, including approximately $0.5&nbsp;million of fuel surcharge revenues. The 2006 and 2007 service
cancellations, when combined with the reduction in AirNet&#146;s air transportation network, as
discussed below, will result in a significant further decline in AirNet&#146;s 2007 Bank Services revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As the banking industry continues its transition to image products and other electronic
alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks, AirNet continues to consult with its
banking customers to determine their future requirements for air transportation services. As a
result of these discussions, AirNet made significant changes to its air transportation network to
meet the evolving service needs of its Bank Services customers and, in many cases, this lowered
their transportation costs. These changes were effective March&nbsp;26, 2007 and resulted in the
elimination of 45 flights, or approximately 10%, of AirNet&#146;s weekday flight schedule. A
substantial portion of the shipment volume previously transported on the eliminated flights has
been transitioned to other AirNet flights as AirNet works closely with its Bank Services customers
to adjust pick up and delivery deadlines to continue to meet their service requirements. AirNet&#146;s
Bank Services revenues are presently expected to decline by approximately $4.5&nbsp;million on an annual
basis, including approximately $0.5&nbsp;million of fuel surcharges, as a direct result of the changes
to AirNet&#146;s air transportation network that were effective
March&nbsp;26, 2007. Reductions in AirNet&#146;s variable operating costs resulting from the elimination of these 45 flights
are expected to substantially offset the anticipated loss of approximately $4.5&nbsp;million in
revenues. AirNet did not reduce the number of
aircraft in its fleet as a result of the March&nbsp;26, 2007 changes in its air transportation network
due to the number of aircraft needed to meet the continuing service requirements of AirNet&#146;s Bank
Services and Express Services customers.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2006, AirNet decided to market for sale all nine of the Cessna 310 aircraft it owns
and, in November&nbsp;2006, AirNet entered into an agreement to sell all nine of the Cessna 310 aircraft
for approximately $0.4&nbsp;million. AirNet agreed to perform an annual inspection and to pay the cost
of the inspection for each aircraft prior to delivery. AirNet delivered six aircraft in the first
quarter of 2007 and expects to deliver the three remaining aircraft in April of 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet provides services to its Bank Services customers under both formal written contracts and
oral agreements. Commencing in 2004, AirNet began implementing bank contracts and pricing
schedules that contain fixed service elements and fixed price components. Under AirNet&#146;s more
recent written bank contracts and its informal oral agreements, AirNet has certain rights to
propose periodic price increases to partially offset anticipated declines in Bank Services
revenues. As Bank Services customers operating under formal and informal agreements containing
fixed price components have experienced an increase in their per item transportation costs as the
number of cancelled checks per shipment declines, it has become difficult for AirNet to obtain
periodic or interim price increases from its Bank Services customers. During 2006, AirNet was
generally unable to obtain interim price increases to offset the decline in Bank Services revenues.
Price increases for AirNet&#146;s Bank Services customers have been implemented primarily on an annual
basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Although there were 2 fewer flying days in 2005 compared to 2004, Bank Services revenues increased
during 2005 primarily due to fuel surcharge revenues resulting from the increase in 2005 in fuel
prices, as indicated by the approximate 43% increase in the OPIS index during 2005. While
cancelled check pounds shipped per flying day decreased by approximately 1% in 2005 from 2004,
revenues increased approximately 2% in 2005 from 2004 as a result of rate increases on Bank
Services.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s Express Services customers typically operate in time-critical, time-definite, and high
control delivery markets, including medical testing laboratories, radioactive pharmaceuticals,
medical equipment, controlled sensitive media, and mission critical parts. AirNet believes its air
transportation network provides certain competitive advantages over other freight forwarders that
must rely primarily upon commercial passenger airlines to process their shipments. These
advantages include later tendering times, better on-time performance, greater control of shipments,
reliable shipment tracking systems and greater flexibility in the design of transportation
solutions for customers with specific needs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Express Revenues &#150; Non Charter represent revenues AirNet derives from shipments on AirNet&#146;s
airline, commercial passenger airlines and point-to-point surface (ground only) shipments. The
total number of Non Charter Express shipments increased approximately 3% in 2006 from 2005 as a
result of increased shipment volume on commercial passenger airlines and point-to-point surface
shipments of approximately 10% and 18%, respectively. The number of Non Charter Express shipments
transported on AirNet&#146;s airline decreased approximately 3% in 2006 compared to 2005 and decreased
approximately 12% in 2005 compared to 2004. Revenues per shipment before fuel surcharges increased
approximately 8% in 2006 from 2005, primarily as a result of an approximate 17% increase in average
weight per shipment and rate increases implemented in September&nbsp;2006. The total number of Non
Charter Express shipments decreased approximately 8% in 2005 from 2004 as a result of the loss of
certain Express Services customers and reduced shipment volume by other Express Services customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Express Revenues &#150; Charters represent revenues AirNet derives from scheduled and unscheduled cargo
charters transported on AirNet&#146;s airline and on aircraft operated by other third parties. AirNet
typically provides charter solutions for customers involved in radioactive pharmaceuticals,
entertainment and the life sciences industry. The increase in revenues in Express
Revenues-Charter in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to an increase in the number of charters,
primarily for customers shipping radioactive pharmaceuticals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Higher fuel prices and additional non charter Express Services revenues during 2006 resulted in
significantly higher fuel surcharge revenues in 2006 compared to 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue yields per pound are similar for Bank Services and Express Services shipments; however,
because the density of cancelled check shipments is much greater than the typical Express Services
shipment, contribution margins on Bank

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Services shipments are substantially higher than Express
Services shipments after considering the cubic dimension of shipments. Furthermore, due to the
unscheduled nature of most Express Services shipments, pick-up and delivery costs per shipment are
higher for Express Services shipments than Bank Services shipments. AirNet believes that lower
check delivery volumes due to the increased use of image products and other electronic alternatives
to the physical movement of cancelled checks will contribute to a significant reduction in Bank
Services revenues and contribution margin in future periods. As Bank Services revenues decline, it
will be necessary to significantly reduce AirNet&#146;s airline operating costs and significantly
increase the contribution margin on Express Services shipments to a level sufficient to support the
operation of AirNet&#146;s transportation network as presently configured or, over time, a substantially
reconfigured transportation network.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Aviation Services revenues primarily relate to AirNet&#146;s fixed base operation services for fuel
sales and aircraft maintenance provided in Columbus, Ohio. AirNet continues to provide aircraft
maintenance services for Pinnacle/Jetride after the sale of Jetride in September&nbsp;2006. AirNet also
provides aircraft maintenance management services and retail maintenance services for other
aircraft and expects to increase revenue related to retail maintenance in 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Aircraft Fuel</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Aircraft fuel expense increased in 2006 from 2005 generally as a result of higher fuel prices.
The 2006 average annual fuel price on the OPIS index increased approximately 13% from the 2005
annual price. A portion of the aircraft fuel expense increase was offset by reduced fuel usage
attributable to changes in flight operations which decreased the hours flown by approximately 11%
in 2006 compared to 2005. Because a portion of the decrease in hours flown was attributable to
routes
subcontracted to other carriers, a portion of the decrease in aircraft fuel expense was offset by
increased contracted air costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The increase in aircraft fuel expense in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to increased
fuel prices. The 2005 average annual fuel price on the OPIS index increased approximately 43% from
the 2004 average annual fuel price.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Aircraft Maintenance</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Aircraft maintenance is primarily based on pre-determined inspection intervals, determined by
hours flown, cycles and the number of aircraft take-offs and landings. High use, older aircraft
that are no longer in production, such as those in AirNet&#146;s cargo fleet, incur higher maintenance
costs than lower use, newer aircraft.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The increase in aircraft maintenance expense primarily reflects the following factors: expensing
approximately 75% of the engine maintenance plan prepayments starting in October&nbsp;2006, as further
described below; higher cost of aircraft parts for out of production aircraft; increasing
maintenance labor costs; and the age of AirNet&#146;s cargo fleet, including Learjets which averaged
approximately 25&nbsp;years in service at the end of 2006, and the related increase in maintenance
required on older aircraft.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet uses manufacturer engine maintenance plans to provide maintenance for recurring inspections
and major overhaul maintenance for most of the engines in its Learjet fleet. Approximately 84% of
AirNet&#146;s Learjet 35 aircraft engines are covered under manufacturer engine maintenance plans.
Under the manufacturer engine maintenance plans, AirNet pays in advance for certain maintenance,
repair and overhaul costs based on an amount per hour for each hour flown. In October&nbsp;2006,
following the write down of a substantial portion of the prepaid assets related to these engine
maintenance plans in connection with the 2006 asset impairment charge, AirNet changed its estimate
of the portion of these payments that should be capitalized and began expensing approximately 75%
of the prepayments, which are included in aircraft maintenance expense. The effect of this change
in estimate increased aircraft maintenance expense by approximately
$1.2&nbsp;million in 2006. Management estimates that the amount of
expense related to this change will be approximately $5.2&nbsp;million to $5.7&nbsp;million in 2007.
Management estimates that expensing payments made under manufacturer engine maintenance plans at
this rate will maintain engine values at the amounts determined to be appropriate as part of the
2006 asset impairment charge. The portion of the prepayments not expensed is classified as flight
equipment and totaled approximately $3.7&nbsp;million and $11.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2005, following the write down of aircraft assets in connection with the 2005 asset
impairment charge, management determined that none of the major maintenance expenditures incurred
after September&nbsp;30, 2005, with the exception of engine repairs and improvements and maintenance
payments made under manufacturer engine maintenance plans, extended the useful life of the
aircraft. Consequently, beginning in October&nbsp;2005, such expenditures were charged to aircraft
maintenance expense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet does not expect to capitalize any significant expenditures made in 2007 related to the
aircraft fleet, with the exception of certain major engine repairs and improvements to engines not
covered by manufacturer engine maintenance plans, and a portion of the prepayments under
manufacturer engine maintenance plans related to the Learjet 35 aircraft.

increased approximately 16% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the approximate 10% increase in
Express Services shipments transported on commercial passenger airlines and a significant increase
in fuel surcharges charged by commercial passenger airlines on these shipments. Commercial freight

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Contracted courier costs for Bank Services increased in 2006 from 2005 and in 2005 from 2004.
These increases resulted from the elimination of certain AirNet employee couriers and contracting
the work they previously performed to third-party couriers to reduce overall payroll costs. AirNet
has experienced higher ground courier costs from its vendors as fuel prices have increased. As
AirNet&#146;s Express Services revenues have increased, the related ground courier costs have also
increased. AirNet&#146;s Express Services customers are generally more costly to serve than AirNet&#146;s
traditional Bank Services customers due to more unscheduled pickup and delivery services and more
geographically dispersed locations. Additionally, ground courier costs related to Express Services
have increased as a result of increases in the number of shipments on commercial airlines and
point-to-point surface shipments in 2006 as compared to 2005. Point-to-point surface shipments
have a significantly higher ground courier expense to revenue ratio than shipments that are
transported on AirNet&#146;s aircraft or commercial passenger airlines.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Aircraft depreciation decreased in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the reduction in AirNet&#146;s
aircraft values as a result of the impairment charges recorded in 2006 and 2005, as discussed
below. Additionally, aircraft engine depreciation, which is based on engine hours operated,
decreased because of the decline in flight hours in 2006 compared to 2005. Management expects 2007
depreciation expense to remain significantly below 2006 levels reflecting the effects of the 2006
asset impairment charge and planned decreases in aircraft flight hours.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in 2006 from 2005 of approximately
$1.6&nbsp;million primarily reflects the reduction in outside consulting expenses associated with
AirNet&#146;s use of an investment banker in 2005 to evaluate various strategic alternatives to enhance
shareholder value, the reduced use of computer programming
contractors which were used more extensively
for software development in 2005, and reduced legal and accounting fees. Additional expense
reductions of approximately $0.8&nbsp;million, primarily related to property taxes, telephone and
computer expenses, were offset by approximately $0.8&nbsp;million of severance expenses incurred under
the separation agreement related to Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff&#146;s resignation as President, Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman of the Board of AirNet in December 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Selling, general and administrative costs increased in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to
approximately $1.3&nbsp;million of incentive compensation expense recorded during 2005 under the 2005
Incentive Compensation Plan as a result of higher pre-tax income, excluding the non-cash impairment
charges. No incentive compensation was recorded in 2004. Increases in professional fees in 2005
due to AirNet&#146;s engagement of financial advisors and an investment banker, as described above, also
contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative costs in 2005. Offsetting these
increases were decreases in commissions for Express Services as well as a decrease in advertising
expense in 2005 as compared to 2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, <I>&#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;). AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets when events or
changes in circumstances indicate, in management&#146;s judgment, that AirNet&#146;s assets might be impaired
and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the
carrying value of those assets. The carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to
estimated fair market value if lower than carrying value. In determining the estimated fair market
value of the assets, AirNet considers information provided by third party valuation firms retained
to assist AirNet in completing its analysis, published market data, recent transactions involving
sales of similar assets and, at September&nbsp;30, 2005, the letter of intent for the sale of AirNet
that was announced on October&nbsp;26, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>2006 Asset Impairment Charge</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s cargo airline was originally designed, and continues to operate, primarily to meet the
needs of Bank Services customers. As a result of accelerating trends in the implementation of
electronic payment alternatives and electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks, as of September&nbsp;30, 2006, AirNet evaluated for impairment the long-lived assets used in its
airline operations, consisting primarily of aircraft, aircraft parts and its airport hangar and
office facility located at Rickenbacker International Airport (the &#147;Rickenbacker Facility&#148;). The
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets including disposal values were
less than the related carrying values and therefore, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;144,
the estimated fair values of these assets were compared to carrying value and the carrying values
were reduced by a $24.6&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge. As a result of AirNet&#146;s evaluation of
the required valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, no tax benefit was recognized related to
this impairment charge as described in &#147;Note 8 &#150; Income Taxes&#148; of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in &#147;ITEM 8 &#150; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The determination of undiscounted cash flows involves estimates of future cash flows, revenues,
operating expenses and disposal values. The projections of these amounts represent management&#146;s
best estimates at the time of the review. Management&#146;s estimates are significantly affected by the
continuing uncertainty of the timing and rate of decline in Bank Services revenues that are being
impacted by the implementation of electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks and AirNet&#146;s potential to grow other lines of cargo business as alternative sources of
revenues. AirNet will continue to explore cost saving initiatives and alternative sources of
revenue; however, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, until such strategies are
developed, AirNet has assigned minimal probabilities to those strategies in AirNet&#146;s determination
of future undiscounted cash flows. In the absence of additional cost saving initiatives or
alternative
sources of revenue, it is likely that future determinations of estimated cash flows will be less
than the carrying value of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets. As a result, AirNet will be required to
monitor the carrying value of its long-lived assets relative to estimated fair values in future
periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The 2006 asset impairment charge was based on a range of estimated fair values provided by third
party appraisal firms. The range of appraised fair values related to AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets
was approximately $49.7&nbsp;million to $27.7&nbsp;million reflecting different market factors, holding
periods and possible asset disposition scenarios that potentially could be elected by AirNet as it
evaluates its strategies in response to the current business environment. Because of the current
uncertainties in the business environment, management determined that the low end of the range of
fair values was the appropriate estimate of fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2006 and wrote down the
carrying value of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets to approximately $27.7&nbsp;million. The determination of
the adjusted carrying value is a management estimate based upon the

subjective factors discussed above. It is possible that the future sales of assets, if any, could
be greater than or less than current carrying values. Further, if management uses different
assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet also recorded an impairment charge as of September&nbsp;30, 2005. On October&nbsp;26, 2005, AirNet
announced that it had entered into a letter of intent for its sale in a going private transaction
at $4.55 per share. Since the price per share in the letter of intent was less than AirNet&#146;s then
net book value per share, AirNet performed the impairment tests required by SFAS No.&nbsp;144 for the
quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2005 and concluded that the long-lived assets used in its Bank Services
and Express Services operations were impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $16.1&nbsp;million
($10.0&nbsp;million net of tax) was recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2005. The impairment charge was based
upon the estimated fair values of the long-lived assets in AirNet&#146;s airline operations derived from
published sources, information provided by a third party valuation firm retained to assist AirNet
in completing its analysis, and the discount inherent in the price per share set forth in the
letter of intent.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>2004 Asset Impairment Charge</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets used in its cargo operations, consisting primarily of aircraft and spare
parts, were also determined to be impaired as of September&nbsp;30, 2004. This determination was made
as a result of industry trends in the adoption of electronic payment alternatives and evolving
electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks at a more rapid pace than
previously anticipated by the industry. AirNet determined that its airline capacity would exceed
future demand, which created an impairment of the aircraft and related assets. The impairment also
reflected the overall decline in the market values of the aircraft in its cargo fleet which had not
recovered as in previous economic cycles. AirNet determined that the expected future undiscounted
cash flows from its assets used in its cargo operations were less than the carrying value of those
assets and were impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash impairment charge of $43.0&nbsp;million ($31.0
million net of tax) was recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2004, using estimated aircraft fair values.
The aircraft fair values used for this purpose were based upon published market sources as of
September&nbsp;30, 2004, which were also used under AirNet&#146;s Amended Credit Agreement described in &#147;Note
4 &#150; Notes Payable&#148; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#147;ITEM 8 &#150;
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, AirNet evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if
changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred sooner. At September&nbsp;30, 2004,
AirNet determined that as a result of the impairment of its long-lived assets used in its Bank
Services and Express Services operations, the remaining goodwill assigned to the cargo operations
should be evaluated for potential impairment. AirNet evaluated the fair value of its goodwill
related to its Bank Services and Express Services operations based upon a discounted future cash
flow analysis. As a result of the impairment test, AirNet determined that its goodwill was
impaired and, accordingly, a non-cash impairment charge of $4.0&nbsp;million was recorded at September
30, 2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s effective tax rates, excluding the effect of discontinued operations, were (14.2%) for
2006, 33.7% for 2005, and 21.4% for 2004. The effective tax rates for 2006, 2005 and 2004 deviate
from statutory federal, state and local rates primarily as a result of tax expense from increases
in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately $6.2&nbsp;million, $0.6&nbsp;million and
$5.7&nbsp;million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the 1996 repurchase and cancellation of the Donald Wright Warrant, AirNet
recognized a related tax benefit estimated to be $7.0&nbsp;million based upon management&#146;s judgment and
estimation of the portion of the Donald Wright Warrant which would be deductible for income tax
purposes. This tax benefit was recognized as additional paid-in capital on AirNet&#146;s Consolidated
Balance Sheet and has had no effect on AirNet&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the
third quarter of 2003, this matter was partially resolved and in the fourth quarter of 2006, was
finalized. AirNet has realized tax deductions related to this transaction in excess of
management&#146;s original estimates resulting in additional tax benefits. The additional tax benefits
associated with the deductible portion of the Donald Wright Warrant have exceeded the original
estimate by $1.3&nbsp;million in 2003 and $0.6&nbsp;million in 2006. The additional tax benefits, as was the
initial estimated tax benefit associated with the Donald Wright Warrant, have been recorded as an
increase to additional paid-in capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require AirNet to record a valuation
allowance against future deferred tax assets if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that AirNet will not
be able to utilize such benefits in the future. At December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, AirNet maintained a
valuation allowance of $12.5&nbsp;million and $6.3&nbsp;million, respectively. In 2006, the valuation
allowance offset deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities. In 2005, the valuation
allowance offset AirNet&#146;s net operating loss carry forwards and Alternative Minimum Tax credit
carry forwards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet filed for a discretionary income tax method change with the Internal
Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;). The discretionary method change requires IRS approval prior to the change
being effective. As required by SFAS No.&nbsp;109, &#147;<I>Accounting for Income Taxes</I>&#148; (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;109&#148;) the
effect of the method change will be reported in the period in which IRS approval is obtained;
therefore, AirNet has not reflected the anticipated impact of the method change in the December&nbsp;31,
2006 financial statements. There is no certainty as to what extent or if the IRS will ultimately
approve the elected method change as requested. However, if the method change is approved, it could
materially change AirNet&#146;s current taxes payable, its deferred tax assets and the need for the
associated valuation allowance, and provide a significant refund of estimated taxes previously
paid.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet has historically met its working capital needs with cash flows from operations and
borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility. Cash flows provided by operating activities from
continuing operations were approximately $15.8&nbsp;million for 2006, $20.3&nbsp;million for 2005, and $19.7
million for 2004. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2006 from 2005 was
primarily caused by increases in receivables and decreases in operating liabilities at December&nbsp;31,
2006 compared to December&nbsp;31, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Cash flow from operating activities &#150; Discontinued Operations</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations were approximately $3.0
million for 2006, $4.3&nbsp;million for 2005, and $0.8&nbsp;million in 2004. The decrease in cash in 2006
from 2005 was primarily caused by decreases in working capital components associated with the sale
of the Jetride passenger charter business in September&nbsp;2006 and subsequent winding down of related
business operations. The increase in operating cash flow in 2005 from 2004 was primarily
attributable to the changes in accounts receivable and other working capital components.

hour. Based upon projected engine hours in 2007, AirNet estimates payments under the engine
maintenance plans to be approximately $6.9 million to $7.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2004, AirNet commenced construction of a new corporate and operational facility (the
&#147;Rickenbacker Facility&#148;) on land leased from the Columbus Regional Airport Authority (the
&#147;Authority&#148;). Construction of the Rickenbacker Facility was completed in May of 2005 and AirNet
completed the relocation of its flight and administrative operations to the Rickenbacker Facility
in June of 2005. The land lease with the Authority is for an initial term of 20&nbsp;years which
expires in May&nbsp;2025. AirNet may request two additional 10&nbsp;year extensions of the land lease. In
the event the Authority refuses to extend the land lease for either 10&nbsp;year extension period, the
land lease requires the Authority to purchase AirNet&#146;s leasehold improvements under the Federal
Relocation Act. The purchase price of the improvements cannot be less than 50% of the cost of the
leasehold improvements if the Authority refuses to extend the land lease for the first 10&nbsp;year
extension period and cannot be less than 25% of the cost of the leasehold improvements if the
Authority refuses to extend the land lease for the second 10&nbsp;year extension period. Annual rental
payments under the land lease are set at approximately $39,000, $62,000 and $83,000, respectively,
for the first three years of the lease term. Rental payments after the third year of the lease
term are subject to annual increases based upon the consumer price index.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet anticipates that cash flows from operations and AirNet&#146;s bank credit facility will provide
adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet AirNet&#146;s expected needs for the
operation of its business, including anticipated capital expenditures; however, AirNet may not have
sufficient capital to pursue other strategic alternatives. There were no significant capital
commitments at December&nbsp;31, 2006 other than the manufacturer engine maintenance plan payments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revolving Credit Facility &#150; 2002 through 2006</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2002, AirNet entered into a $35.0&nbsp;million unsecured revolving credit facility and a
five-year $20.0&nbsp;million unsecured term loan (collectively, the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;). The revolving
credit facility under the Credit Agreement was originally scheduled to expire on September&nbsp;30, 2005
and the secured term loan was to mature on September&nbsp;30, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;28, 2004, AirNet and its lenders amended the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement
(the &#147;Amended Credit Agreement&#148;). The Amended Credit Agreement was further amended by the First,
Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Change in Terms Agreements, as described below. The Amended Credit
Agreement was secured by a first lien on all of the property of AirNet and its subsidiaries, other
than any interest in real estate and certain excluded fixed assets. AirNet also pledged the stock
and interests of its subsidiaries to secure the loans under the Amended Credit Agreement, and each
of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries guaranteed AirNet&#146;s obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. The
Amended Credit Agreement also contained certain financial covenants that require AirNet to maintain
a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and to not exceed certain fixed charge coverage and
leverage ratios specified in the Amended Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Amended Credit Agreement initially provided for a secured revolving credit facility of up to
$35.0&nbsp;million and a secured term loan in the aggregate amount of $14.0&nbsp;million. The amount of
revolving loans available under the Amended Credit Agreement was limited to a borrowing base equal
to the aggregate of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 50% of eligible aircraft parts, plus
70% of the market value of certain fixed assets, reduced by the aggregate amount of AirNet&#146;s
outstanding letters of credit. The Amended Credit Agreement bore interest, at AirNet&#146;s option, at
(a)&nbsp;a fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio as defined in
the Amended Credit Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;a floating rate based on the greater of (i)&nbsp;the prime rate
established by The Huntington National Bank from time to time plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s
leverage ratio or (ii)&nbsp;the sum of 0.5% plus the federal funds rate in effect from time to time plus
a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Amended Credit Facility was amended in September&nbsp;2004, March&nbsp;2005, November&nbsp;2005, March&nbsp;2006
and September&nbsp;2006. The above amendments to the Amended Credit Facility were reflected,
respectively, in the &#147;First Change in Terms Agreement&#148;, the &#147;Second Change in Terms Agreement&#148; ,
the &#147;Third Change in Terms Agreement&#148;, the &#147;Fourth Change in Terms Agreement&#148; and the &#147;Fifth Change
in Terms Agreement&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of the impairment charges recorded by AirNet in September&nbsp;2004, September&nbsp;2005 and
September&nbsp;2006, AirNet was not in compliance with certain terms and conditions of the Amended
Credit Facility, including the fixed charge coverage ratio, the leverage ratio and the minimum
consolidated tangible net worth requirement. The First, Third and Fifth Change in Terms Agreements
modified certain financial covenants contained in the Amended Credit Facility in such a manner
that, on a going-forward basis, the impairment charges, in and of themselves, would not cause a
default of these financial covenants in the future. At the same time that the First, Third and
Fifth Change in Terms Agreements were entered into, AirNet and its lenders executed waivers of any
defaults or potential defaults under the Amended Credit Agreement which occurred, or may have
occurred, as a result of AirNet&#146;s failure to comply with the above financial covenants due to the
various impairment charges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to the amendments made to the Amended Credit Facility to bring the financial covenants
into compliance after the impairment charges recorded in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Amended Credit
Facility was amended on several occasions to modify other terms and conditions of the Amended
Credit Facility. The Second Change in Terms Agreement amended the Amended Credit Facility to
reflect that AirNet had prepaid in full the remaining $11.0&nbsp;million balance outstanding on its
secured term loan. In addition, the Second Change in Terms Agreement reduced the secured revolving
credit facility from $35.0&nbsp;million to $30.0&nbsp;million. The Second Change in Terms Agreement also
extended the term of the Amended Credit
Facility from September&nbsp;30, 2005 to October&nbsp;15, 2006. The Fourth Change in Terms Agreement further
extended the term of the Amended Credit Agreement from
October&nbsp;15, 2006 to October&nbsp;15, 2007 and modified the
calculation of the borrowing base. The
Fifth Change in Terms Agreement reduced the amount of the secured revolving credit facility from
$25&nbsp;million to $15&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, there was no amount outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet had $1.0&nbsp;million in letters of credit outstanding related to insurance
programs, which reduced the amount available under the revolving credit facility. As of December
31, 2006, AirNet had $14.0&nbsp;million available to borrow under its secured revolving credit facility
under the Amended Credit Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;29, 2007, AirNet and its lender (The Huntington National Bank) amended and restated the
terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May&nbsp;28, 2004, among
The Huntington National Bank and Bank One, N.A., as lenders, and AirNet, as borrower (as amended
and restated, the &#147;Amended Credit Agreement&#148;) by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement (the &#147;Second Amended Credit Agreement&#148;). The following description of the Second Amended
Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second Amended Credit Agreement.
The Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $15.0&nbsp;million secured revolving credit facility
and expires on October&nbsp;15, 2008. The Second Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a first
priority lien on all of the property of AirNet, other than any interest in real estate and certain
excluded fixed assets. The stock and interests of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries continue to be pledged to
secure the loans under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, and each of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries
continues to guarantee AirNet&#146;s obligations under the Second Amended Credit Agreement under a
Consent and Agreement of Guarantors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The amount of revolving loans available under the Second Amended Credit Agreement is limited to a
borrowing base equal to the aggregate of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 50% of eligible
aircraft parts. The amount available under the Second Amended
Credit Agreement is also reduced by any outstanding letters of credit issued under the Second
Amended Credit Agreement. The Second Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at AirNet&#146;s option,
at (a)&nbsp;a fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio as defined
in the Second Amended Credit Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;a floating rate based on the greater of (i)&nbsp;the
prime rate established by The Huntington National Bank from time to time plus a margin determined
by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio or (ii)&nbsp;the sum of 0.5% plus the federal funds rate in effect from time
to time plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Second Amended Credit Agreement permits AirNet to maintain and incur other indebtedness in an
aggregate amount of up to $10.0&nbsp;million for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing aircraft and
related tangible fixed assets. The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains certain financial
covenants that require AirNet to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and to not
exceed certain fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios specified in the Second Amended Credit
Agreement. The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains limitations on operating leases,
significant corporate changes including mergers and sales of assets, investments in subsidiaries
and acquisitions, liens, capital expenditures, transactions with affiliates, sales of accounts
receivable, sale and leaseback transactions and other off-balance sheet liabilities, contingent
obligations and hedging transactions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;24, 2005, AirNet entered into a three-year term loan totaling $11.0&nbsp;million with a fixed
interest rate of 8.12%. This term loan is secured by seven Cessna Caravans and nine Learjet 35
aircraft from AirNet&#146;s cargo aircraft fleet. The aircraft securing this loan were released from
the collateral securing the loans under Amended Credit Agreement in accordance with the Second
Change in Terms Agreement. The proceeds from this term loan were used to prepay in full AirNet&#146;s
term loan under the Amended Credit Agreement as described above. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, $8.0
million was outstanding under this term loan.

26, 2006, Jetride repaid in full six term loans which had been (a)&nbsp;secured by aircraft used in the
Jetride passenger charter business, and (b)&nbsp;guaranteed by AirNet. In June&nbsp;2004, Jetride entered
into four of the term loans, each with a seven-year term and a fixed interest rate of approximately
6.7%. In July&nbsp;2004, Jetride entered into the other two term loans, each with a seven-year term and
a fixed interest rate of approximately 6.5%. As of September&nbsp;26, 2006 and December&nbsp;31, 2005, there
was an aggregate principal amount of approximately $28.2&nbsp;million and $29.8&nbsp;million, respectively,
outstanding under the six loans. In addition to the outstanding principal amount, Jetride paid
approximately $0.3&nbsp;million in accrued interest and early termination prepayment penalties through
the repayment date. Each of the loan documents and corresponding security and guaranty agreements
entered into in connection with the six term loans was terminated upon repayment of the underlying
term loans at the closing.

maintenance plans in connection with the 2006 asset impairment charge, AirNet changed its estimate
of the portion of these payments that should be capitalized and began expensing approximately 75%
of the prepayments, which are included in aircraft maintenance expense. The effect of this change
in estimate increased aircraft maintenance expense by approximately
$1.2&nbsp;million in 2006. Management estimates that the amount of
expense related to this change will be approximately $5.2&nbsp;million to $5.7&nbsp;million in 2007.
Management estimates that expensing payments made under manufacturer engine maintenance plans at
this rate will maintain engine values at the amounts determined to be appropriate as part of the
2006 asset impairment charge. The portion of the prepayments not expensed is classified as flight
equipment and totaled $3.7&nbsp;million and $11.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Capital expenditures for continuing operations totaled approximately $8.1&nbsp;million in 2006 compared
to $15.5&nbsp;million in 2005. The 2006 expenditures were primarily for major engine overhauls. The
2005 and 2004 expenditures were primarily for major engine overhauls, the construction of the
Rickenbacker Facility, and periodic aircraft inspections.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2002, AirNet entered into operating leases for six Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft. After
certain lease extensions entered into in September&nbsp;2002, five of the leases were scheduled to
terminate in 2006 and one in 2007. In January of 2003, AirNet entered into an additional operating
lease on a Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft that expires in 2008. In 2006, AirNet extended the term of
four of the leases that were scheduled to terminate in 2006, each for an additional one-year term.
The remaining lease expired in August&nbsp;2006 as scheduled. In January&nbsp;2006, AirNet entered into an
additional operating lease on a Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft for a one-year term. In January&nbsp;2007,
AirNet extended this lease for an additional one-year term. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet
maintained leases on seven Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft, five of which are scheduled to expire in
2007 and two of which are scheduled to expire in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, AirNet does not
record operating leases in its Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, the minimum lease payments
related to these leases are disclosed in &#147;Note 6 &#150; Lease Obligations&#148; of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in &#147;ITEM 8 &#150; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA&#148; of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2000, AirNet announced a stock repurchase plan allowing AirNet to purchase up to $3.0
million of its common shares. During 2000, AirNet purchased $2.4&nbsp;million in common shares funded
by cash flows from operations. There has been no repurchase activity under this program since
2000. As such, purchases of approximately $0.6&nbsp;million of AirNet&#146;s common shares may still be made
in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Investing Activities &#150; Discontinued Operations</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net cash was provided by investing activities related to discontinued operations in 2006 as a
result of the sale of the Jetride passenger charter business (see &#147;Note 3 &#150; Discontinued
Operations&#148; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#147;ITEM 8 &#150; FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in September&nbsp;2006. The sale
proceeds were reduced by cash expenditures in 2006 and 2005, capital expenditures, primarily for
aircraft engine overhauls, and, in addition, for the nine-month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2005,
capital expenditures for aircraft improvements. Net cash was used in investing activities in 2005
and 2004 for aircraft engine overhauls, periodic aircraft inspections, and in 2004, the acquisition
of passenger aircraft.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet had no &#147;off-balance sheet arrangements&#148; as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, as that term is defined by
the SEC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Seasonality and Variability in Quarterly Results</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s operations historically have been somewhat seasonal relative to holidays observed by
financial institutions. When financial institutions are closed on holidays falling on Monday
through Thursday, AirNet&#146;s revenue and net income are adversely affected. AirNet&#146;s fiscal quarter
ending December&nbsp;31 is often the most impacted by bank holidays.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Operating results are also affected by the weather. Winter weather often requires additional costs
for de-icing, hangar rental and other aircraft services. AirNet generally experiences higher
maintenance costs during its fiscal quarter ending March&nbsp;31.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The results for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2006 presented above have been revised from
those previously presented in AirNet&#146;s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed for the quarter ended
September&nbsp;30, 2006. AirNet determined that an error was made in recording the tax benefit
associated with the Donald Wright Warrants (See &#147;Note 8 &#150; Income Taxes&#148; of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#147;ITEM 8 &#150; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) as a reduction of income tax expense rather than as an
increase to additional paid-in capital. Income tax expense and net loss for the quarter ended
September&nbsp;30, 2006 as previously reported have been increased by $619,000 resulting in an increase
in net loss from ($18.1) million as previously reported to ($18.7) million. On a basic and diluted
per common share basis, the affect of this adjustment increased the net loss from continuing
operations and net loss by ($.03 per share) from ($1.82) and ($1.79) as previously reported to
($1.88) and ($1.85) as presented above, respectively. AirNet is not
required to and will not amend its previously filed
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Included in the losses from continuing operations before interest and income taxes for the quarters
ended September&nbsp;30, 2006 and 2005 were non-cash asset impairment charges of approximately $24.6
million and $16.1&nbsp;million, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant
judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In
many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. AirNet
maintains a thorough process to review the application of its accounting policies and to evaluate
the appropriateness of the estimates; however, even under optimal circumstances, estimates
routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better
information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either
the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies, and
are material to AirNet&#146;s consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the
development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit
Committee of its Board of Directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Historically, AirNet&#146;s credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because its
credit management processes have been effective. AirNet also recognizes billing adjustments to
revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts, money back service guarantees and billing
corrections.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical
experience of bad debts, adjustments processed, current collection and aging trends, and the
individual assessment of customers&#146; credit quality. Once AirNet considers all these factors, a
determination is made as to the appropriate amount of the allowance for uncollectible accounts
receivable. Allowances for these future adjustments aggregated $0.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006
and $0.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005. AirNet considers the sensitivity and subjectivity of these
estimates to be moderate, as changes in economic conditions and pricing arrangements can
significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Major Aircraft Maintenance</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Costs of major overhauls and engine work which are expected to extend the useful life of the
related asset are capitalized as incurred and depreciated based on hours flown. The original costs
of airframes, less an estimated salvage value, are depreciated based on the straight-line method
over the estimated useful life of the aircraft. Aircraft maintenance costs not meeting AirNet&#146;s
capitalization requirements are expensed as incurred. AirNet uses manufacturer engine maintenance
plans to provide maintenance for recurring inspections and major overhaul maintenance for most of
the engines in its Learjet fleet. Approximately 84% of AirNet&#146;s Learjet 35 aircraft engines are
covered under manufacturer engine maintenance plans. Under the manufacturer engine maintenance
plans, AirNet pays in advance for certain maintenance, repair and overhaul costs based on an amount
per hour for each hour flown. In October&nbsp;2006, following the write down of a substantial portion
of the prepaid assets related to these engine maintenance plans in connection with the 2006 asset
impairment charge, AirNet changed its estimate of the portion of these payments that should be
capitalized and began expensing approximately 75% of the prepayments, which are included in
aircraft maintenance expense. The effect of this change in estimate increased aircraft maintenance
expense by approximately $1.2&nbsp;million in 2006. Management
estimates that the amount of expense related to this change will be
approximately $5.2&nbsp;million to $5.7&nbsp;million in 2007. Management estimates that expensing payments
made under manufacturer engine maintenance plans at this rate will maintain engine values at the
amounts determined to be appropriate as part of the 2006 asset impairment charge. The portion of
the prepayments not expensed is classified as flight equipment and totaled $3.7&nbsp;million and $11.2
million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Property and Equipment</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s Bank Services and Express Services business are capital intensive. Over 85% of AirNet&#146;s
total assets are invested in flight equipment to serve these markets. AirNet capitalizes those
costs that meet the definition of capital assets under applicable accounting standards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The depreciation or amortization of AirNet&#146;s capital assets over their estimated useful lives,
and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future
events. Because AirNet utilizes many of its capital assets over relatively long periods,
management periodically evaluates whether adjustments to estimated lives or salvage values are
necessary. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized
in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Stock-Based Compensation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet had two stock-based employee and director compensation plans, the
Amended and Restated 1996 Incentive Stock Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. Through December
31, 2005, AirNet accounted for the plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB
Opinion No.&nbsp;25, <I>&#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148;, </I>and related interpretations as
permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, <I>&#147;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation&#148;</I>. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, AirNet adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), <I>&#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; </I>(&#147;FAS 123(R)&#148;), that addresses the
accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services
in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the
fair value of the enterprise&#146;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such
equity instruments. FAS 123(R) eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions, as AirNet formerly did, using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by APB Opinion
No.&nbsp;25, and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based
method and recognized as expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method which requires the
application of the accounting standard as of January&nbsp;1, 2006. AirNet&#146;s consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 reflects the impact of adopting FAS 123(R). In
accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the consolidated statements of
operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of
FAS 123(R).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Stock-based compensation expense recognized during 2006 is based on the value of the portion of
stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006
included compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested,
as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro
forma provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;148. Compensation expense for
the stock-based payment awards that are granted subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2005 are based on the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">accordance with FAS 123(R). As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 is based on awards
ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. FAS 123(R) requires
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In the pro forma information required under FAS
148 for the periods prior to 2006, AirNet accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Stock
options are further detailed in &#147;Note 1 &#150; Significant Accounting Policies&#148; and &#147;Note 5 &#150; Incentive

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Self-Insurance Accruals</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet is self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers&#146; compensation claims
and benefits paid under employee health care programs. At December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, AirNet had
total self-insurance accruals reflected in its Consolidated Balance Sheets of approximately $0.5
million and $0.6&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical loss experience and
judgments about the present and expected levels of costs. AirNet accounts for these costs
primarily through measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments based on recent claims
experience. AirNet believes its recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured
on an appropriate basis; however, changes in health costs, loss development factors, accident
frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these
liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Incentive Compensation Plans</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet maintains an incentive compensation plan with payouts tied to the achievement of
company-wide earnings goals and personal/departmental goals. Incentive compensation is calculated
as a percent of base pay, depending on participation levels, which vary among management tiers.
Costs related to the company-wide earnings portion of the plan are accrued based on actual
quarterly results. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet recorded approximately $1.3&nbsp;million
of incentive compensation expense, none of which related to discontinued operations. For the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, AirNet recorded approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of incentive compensation
expense, of which approximately $0.3&nbsp;million related to discontinued operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet accounts for income taxes under the liability method pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;109. Under the
liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and
laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require AirNet to record a valuation
allowance against future deferred tax assets if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that AirNet will not
be able to utilize such benefits in the future. At December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, AirNet maintained a
valuation allowance of $12.5&nbsp;million and $6.3&nbsp;million, respectively. In 2006, the valuation
allowance offset deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities. In 2005, the valuation
allowance offset AirNet&#146;s net operating loss carry forwards and Alternative Minimum Tax credit
carry forwards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet filed for a discretionary income tax method change with the IRS. The
discretionary method change requires IRS approval prior to the change being effective. As required
by SFAS No.&nbsp;109, the effect of the method change will be reported in the period in which IRS
approval is obtained; therefore, AirNet has not reflected the anticipated impact of the method
change in the December&nbsp;31, 2006 financial statements. There is no certainty as to what extent or if
the IRS will ultimately approve the elected method change as requested. However, if the method
change is approved, it could materially change AirNet&#146;s current taxes payable, its deferred tax
assets and the need for the associated valuation allowance, and provide a significant refund of
estimated taxes previously paid.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Impairment of Assets and Goodwill</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144. AirNet
recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate,
in management&#146;s judgment, that AirNet&#146;s assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets. The
carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to estimated fair market value if lower
than carrying value. In determining the estimated fair market value of the assets, AirNet
considers
information provided by third party valuation firms retained to assist AirNet in completing its
analysis, published market data, recent transactions involving sales of similar assets and, at
September&nbsp;30, 2005, the letter of intent for the sale of AirNet that was announced on October&nbsp;26,
2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks, as of September&nbsp;30, 2006, AirNet
evaluated for impairment the long-lived assets used in its airline operations, consisting primarily
of aircraft, aircraft parts and its airport hangar and office facility located at the Rickenbacker
Facility. The undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets including disposal
values were less than the related carrying values and therefore, pursuant to the requirements of
SFAS No.&nbsp;144, the estimated fair values of these assets were compared to carrying value and the
carrying values were reduced by a $24.6&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge. As a result of
AirNet&#146;s evaluation of the required valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, no tax benefit was
recognized related to this impairment charge as described in &#147;Note 8 &#150; Income Taxes&#148; of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#147;ITEM 8 &#150; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The determination of undiscounted cash flows involves estimates of future cash flows, revenues,
operating expenses and disposal values. The projections of these amounts represent management&#146;s
best estimates at the time of the review. Management&#146;s estimates are significantly affected by the
continuing uncertainty of the timing and rate of decline in Bank Services revenues that are being
impacted by the implementation of electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks and AirNet&#146;s potential to grow other lines of cargo business as alternative sources of
revenues. AirNet will continue to explore cost saving initiatives and alternative sources of
revenue; however, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, until such strategies are
developed, AirNet has assigned minimal probabilities to those strategies in AirNet&#146;s determination
of future undiscounted cash flows. In the absence of additional cost saving initiatives or
alternative sources of revenue, it is likely that future determinations of estimated cash flows
will be less than the carrying value of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets. As a result, AirNet will be
required to monitor the carrying value of its long-lived assets relative to estimated fair values
in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The 2006 asset impairment charge was based on a range of estimated fair values provided by third
party appraisal firms. The range of appraised fair values related to AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets
was approximately $49.7&nbsp;million to $27.7&nbsp;million reflecting different market factors, holding
periods and possible asset disposition scenarios that potentially could be elected by AirNet as it
evaluates its strategies in response to the current business environment. Because of the current
uncertainties in the business environment, management determined that the low end of the range of
fair values was the appropriate estimate of fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2006 and wrote down the
carrying value of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets to approximately $27.7&nbsp;million. The determination of
the adjusted carrying value is a management estimate based upon the third party appraisals and the
subjective factors discussed above. It is possible that the future sales of assets, if any, could
be greater than or less than current carrying values. Further, if management uses different
assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different
than those anticipated, additional impairment charges may be required.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet also recorded an impairment charge as of September&nbsp;30, 2005. On October&nbsp;26, 2005, AirNet
announced that it had entered into a letter of intent for its sale in a going private transaction
at $4.55 per share. Since the price per share in the letter of intent was less than AirNet&#146;s then
net book value per share, AirNet performed the impairment tests required by SFAS No.&nbsp;144 for the
quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2005 and concluded that the long-lived assets used in its Bank Services
and Express Services operations were impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $16.1&nbsp;million
($10.0&nbsp;million net of tax) was recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2005. The impairment charge was based
upon the estimated fair values of the long-lived assets in AirNet&#146;s airline operations derived from
published sources, information provided by a third party valuation firm retained to assist AirNet
in completing its analysis, and the discount inherent in the price per share set forth in the
letter of intent.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>2004 Asset Impairment Charge</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets used in its cargo operations, consisting primarily of aircraft and spare
parts, were also determined to be impaired as of September&nbsp;30, 2004. This determination was made
as a result of industry trends in the adoption of electronic payment alternatives and evolving
electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks at a more rapid pace than
previously anticipated by the industry. AirNet determined that its airline capacity would exceed
future demand, which created an impairment of the aircraft and related assets. The impairment also
reflected the overall decline in the market values of the aircraft in its cargo fleet which had not
recovered as in previous economic cycles. AirNet determined that the expected future undiscounted
cash flows from its assets used in its cargo operations were less than the carrying value of those
assets and were impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash impairment charge of $43.0&nbsp;million ($31.0
million net of tax) was recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2004, using estimated aircraft fair values.
The aircraft fair values used for this purpose were based upon published market sources as of
September&nbsp;30, 2004, which were also used under AirNet&#146;s Amended Credit Agreement described in &#147;Note
4 &#150; Notes Payable&#148; of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#147;ITEM 8 &#150; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

Taxes &#150; an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109&#148; </I>(&#147;FIN 48&#148;), which clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires that AirNet recognize in its financial statements
the impact of a tax position based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also requires
additional disclosures about unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain income tax
positions and a reconciliation of the change in the unrecognized benefit. In addition, FIN 48
requires interest to be recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax
positions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2006, with the
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening
retained earnings. AirNet continues to evaluate the impact of FIN 48 on AirNet&#146;s consolidated

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet is exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal
course of business. AirNet&#146;s primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk. At
December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet had no amounts outstanding under its Amended Credit Agreement (described
above in the section captioned &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#150; Financing Activities &#150; Continuing
Operations&#148; in &#147;ITEM 7 &#150; MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATION&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). On March 29, 2007, AirNet and its lender (The
Huntington National Bank) amended the terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement by
entering into the Second Amended Credit Agreement. The Second Amended Credit Agreement bears
interest, at AirNet&#146;s option, at (a)&nbsp;a fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin determined by
AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;a floating rate
based on the greater of (i)&nbsp;the prime rate established by The Huntington National Bank from time to
time plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement
and (ii)&nbsp;the sum of 0.5% plus the federal funds rate in effect from time to time plus a margin
determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Following the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement dated May&nbsp;28, 2004, AirNet paid off
three secured term loans which had been secured by aircraft. One of those loans had an interest
rate swap agreement associated with it. This interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount
of $3.0&nbsp;million and a fixed rate of 4.25% plus a margin based on AirNet&#146;s funded debt ratio was
terminated in August&nbsp;2005.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet generally assesses its Bank Services customers a fuel surcharge, which is generally based on
the Oil Price Index Summary &#150; Columbus, Ohio (OPIS)&nbsp;index. AirNet also assesses most of its
Express Services customers a fuel surcharge based on the OPIS index, which is adjusted monthly
based on changes in the OPIS index. As index rates fluctuate above a set threshold,
surcharge rates will increase or decrease accordingly. The fuel surcharge rate is applied to the
revenue amount billed to Bank Services and Express Services customers. AirNet assesses certain
Express customers fuel surcharges based on negotiated contractual rates.<BR>

AirNet Systems, Inc.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AirNet Systems, Inc. (the
&#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
cash flows and shareholders&#146; equity for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31,
2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item&nbsp;15 (a)
2 of the Annual Report of AirNet Systems, Inc. on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31,
2006. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the management of the
Company. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
based on our audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We
were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.
Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet uses manufacturer engine maintenance plans to provide maintenance for recurring inspections
and major overhaul maintenance for most of the engines in its Learjet fleet. Approximately 84% of
AirNet&#146;s Learjet 35 aircraft engines are covered under manufacturer engine maintenance plans.
Under the manufacturer engine maintenance
plans, AirNet pays in advance for certain maintenance, repair and overhaul costs based on an amount
per hour for each hour flown. In October&nbsp;2006, following the write down of a substantial portion
of the prepaid assets related to these engine maintenance plans in connection with the 2006 asset
impairment charge, AirNet changed its estimate of the portion of these payments that should be
capitalized and began expensing approximately 75% of the prepayments, which are included in
aircraft maintenance expense. The effect of this change in estimate increased aircraft maintenance
expense by approximately $1.2&nbsp;million in

Management estimates that the amount of expense related to this change will be approximately $5.2&nbsp;million to $5.7&nbsp;million
in 2007. Management estimates that expensing payments made under manufacturer engine maintenance
plans at this rate will maintain engine values at the amounts determined to be appropriate as part
of the 2006 asset impairment charge. The portion of the prepayments not expensed is classified as
flight equipment and totaled $3.7&nbsp;million and $11.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Amortization on these prepaid balances does not begin until major engine overhaul
services have been performed, at which time the prepaid balances are reclassified into depreciable
asset categories and depreciated based on hours flown.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;144, <I>&#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;). AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets when events or
changes in circumstances indicate, in management&#146;s judgment, that AirNet&#146;s assets might be impaired
and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the
carrying value of those assets. The carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to
estimated fair market value if lower than carrying value. In determining the estimated fair market
value of the assets, AirNet considers information provided by third party valuation firms retained
to assist AirNet in completing its analysis, published market data, recent transactions involving
sales of similar assets and, at September&nbsp;30, 2005, the letter of intent for the sale of AirNet
that was announced on October&nbsp;26, 2005.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet is self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers&#146; compensation claims
and benefits paid under employee health care programs. The measurement of these costs requires the
consideration of historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of
costs. AirNet accounts for these costs primarily through measurement of claims outstanding and
projected payments based on recent claims experience.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Incentive Compensation Plans</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet maintains an incentive compensation plan with payouts tied to the achievement of
company-wide earnings goals and personal/departmental goals. Incentive compensation is calculated
as a percent of base pay, depending on participation levels, which vary among management tiers.
AirNet accrues for costs related to the personal/departmental goals portion of the plan based on
estimated achievement rates of set goals applied to individuals&#146; base pay rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet accounts for income taxes under the liability method pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;109, <I>&#147;Accounting
for Income Taxes.&#148; </I>Under the liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require AirNet to record a valuation
allowance against future deferred tax assets if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that AirNet will not
be able to utilize such benefits in the future. At December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, AirNet maintained a
valuation allowance of $12.5&nbsp;million and $6.3&nbsp;million, respectively. In 2006, the valuation
allowance offset deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities. In 2005, the valuation
allowance offset AirNet&#146;s net operating loss carry forwards and Alternative Minimum Tax credit
carry forwards.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Goodwill</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;<I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; </I>requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets no longer be amortized, but instead be evaluated for impairment on a &#147;reporting
unit&#148; basis annually, or more frequently if
changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred sooner. A reporting unit is the
operating segment unless, for businesses within that operating segment, discrete financial
information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, in which case such a component
business is the reporting unit.

<DIV style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The impairment test is conducted by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit, primarily
determined by computing the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting
unit, with its carrying value and if the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill may
potentially be impaired. If there is potential impairment, the fair value of the reporting unit is
allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order
to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. This implied fair value is
then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill, and if the implied fair
value is less, an impairment loss is recognized.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair value of AirNet&#146;s financial instruments approximated their carrying value at December&nbsp;31,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Derivatives</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet has been party to various interest rate swap agreements with banks as a hedge against the
interest rate risk associated with borrowing at variable rates. These swap agreements are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The objective of the hedge is to eliminate the variability of
cash flows in the interest rate payments on the variable rate debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2002, AirNet entered into a five-year interest rate swap agreement with a bank relative
to a $3.0&nbsp;million term loan. Following the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement dated May
28, 2004, and as discussed in Note 4 below, AirNet paid off three secured term loans which had been
secured by aircraft. This interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $3.0&nbsp;million and
a fixed rate of 4.25% plus a margin based on AirNet&#146;s funded debt ratio was terminated in August
2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet accounts for its swap agreements under SFAS No.&nbsp;133, <I>&#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities&#148;</I>, and its amendments, SFAS Nos. 137 and 138. These statements require
AirNet to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not
hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the
nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the
change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
portion of a derivative&#146;s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. In 2004,
AirNet recognized comprehensive income of approximately $22,000, net of tax, related to the swaps.
The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is immaterial for all years presented. There
were no interest rate swap agreements in place at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Stock-Based Compensation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet had two stock-based employee and director compensation plans, the
Amended and Restated 1996 Incentive Stock Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. Through December
31, 2005, AirNet accounted for the plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB
Opinion No.&nbsp;25, <I>&#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148;, </I>and related interpretations as
permitted by SFAS No.&nbsp;123, <I>&#147;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&#148;</I>. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006,
AirNet adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), <I>&#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; </I>(&#147;FAS 123(R)&#148;), that addresses
the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee
services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based
on the fair value of the enterprise&#146;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of
such equity instruments. FAS 123(R) eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions, as AirNet formerly did, using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by APB Opinion
No.&nbsp;25, and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based
method and recognized as expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method which requires the
application of the accounting standard as of January&nbsp;1, 2006. AirNet&#146;s consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 reflects the impact of adopting FAS 123(R). In
accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the consolidated statements of
operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of
FAS 123(R).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Stock-based compensation expense recognized during 2006 is based on the value of the portion of
stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006
included compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested,
as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro
forma provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;148. Compensation expense for the stock-based payment awards that are
granted subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2005 will be based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with FAS 123(R). As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated
statement of operations for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for
estimated forfeitures. FAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and
revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In
the pro forma information required under SFAS No.&nbsp;148 for the periods prior to 2006, AirNet
accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Currently, AirNet uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock
options granted to employees and directors for purposes of computing the stock-based compensation
expense and disclosures required by FAS 123(R). During 2006, AirNet recognized stock-based
compensation expense of approximately $246,000 (approximately $153,000 net of tax) related to the
vesting of outstanding stock options according to the provisions of FAS 123(R), using the modified
prospective transition method. Basic and diluted net income (loss)&nbsp;per share for 2006 did not
change as a result of the adoption of FAS 123(R).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following table illustrates the effect on operating results and per share information had
AirNet accounted for share-based compensation expense in accordance with FAS 123(R) for the periods

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, <I>&#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes &#150; an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109&#148; </I>(&#147;FIN 48&#148;), which clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires that AirNet recognize in its financial statements
the impact of a tax position based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also requires
additional disclosures about unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain income tax
positions and a reconciliation of the change in the unrecognized benefit. In addition, FIN 48
requires interest to be recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax
positions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2006, with the
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening
retained earnings. AirNet continues to evaluate the impact of FIN 48 on AirNet&#146;s consolidated
financial statements. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, AirNet has not fully
competed its assessment upon adoption of this standard; however, AirNet does not expect the impact
to be significant, if any.

misstatement. The guidance is applicable for fiscal years ending after November&nbsp;15, 2006. AirNet
has evaluated the guidance provided in SAB 108 and has determined that it will not have a
significant impact on the determination or reporting of AirNet&#146;s financial results.

impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than
the carrying value of those assets. The carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to
estimated fair market value if lower than carrying value. In determining the estimated fair market
value of the assets, AirNet considers information provided by third party valuation firms retained
to assist AirNet in completing its analysis, published market data, recent transactions involving
sales of similar assets and, at September&nbsp;30, 2005, the letter of intent for the sale of AirNet
that was announced on October&nbsp;26, 2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>2006 Asset Impairment Charge</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s cargo airline was originally designed, and continues to operate, primarily to meet the
needs of Bank Services customers. As a result of accelerating trends in the implementation of
electronic payment alternatives and electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks, as of September&nbsp;30, 2006, AirNet evaluated for impairment the long-lived assets used in its
airline operations, consisting primarily of aircraft, aircraft parts and its airport hangar and
office facility located at Rickenbacker International Airport (the &#147;Rickenbacker Facility&#148;). The
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets including disposal values were
less than the related carrying values and therefore, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;144,
the estimated fair values of these assets were compared to carrying value and the carrying values
were reduced by a $24.6&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge. As a result of AirNet&#146;s evaluation of
the required valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, no tax benefit was recognized related to
this impairment charge as described in Note 8 below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The determination of undiscounted cash flows involves estimates of future cash flows, revenues,
operating expenses and disposal values. The projections of these amounts represent management&#146;s
best estimates at the time of the review. Management&#146;s estimates are significantly affected by the
continuing uncertainty of the timing and rate of decline in Bank Services revenues that are being
impacted by the implementation of electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled
checks and AirNet&#146;s potential to grow other lines of cargo business as alternative sources of
revenues. AirNet will continue to explore cost saving initiatives and alternative sources of
revenue; however, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;144, until such strategies are
developed, AirNet has assigned minimal probabilities to those strategies in AirNet&#146;s determination
of future undiscounted cash flows. In the absence of additional cost saving initiatives or
alternative sources of revenue, it is likely that future determinations of estimated cash flows
will be less than the carrying value of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets. As a result, AirNet will be
required to monitor the carrying value of its long-lived assets relative to estimated fair values
in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The 2006 asset impairment charge was based on a range of estimated fair values provided by third
party appraisal firms. The range of appraised fair values related to AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets
was approximately $49.7&nbsp;million to $27.7&nbsp;million reflecting different market factors, holding
periods and possible asset disposition scenarios that potentially could be elected by AirNet as it
evaluates its strategies in response to the current business environment. Because of the current
uncertainties in the business environment, management determined that the low end of the range of
fair values was the appropriate estimate of fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2006 and wrote down the
carrying value of AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets to approximately $27.7&nbsp;million. The determination of
the adjusted carrying value is a management estimate based upon the third party appraisals and the
subjective factors discussed above. It is possible that the future sales of assets, if any, could
be greater than or less than current carrying values. Further, if management uses different
assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different
than those anticipated, additional impairment charges may be required.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet also recorded an impairment charge as of September&nbsp;30, 2005. On October&nbsp;26, 2005, AirNet
announced that it had entered into a letter of intent for its sale in a going private transaction
at $4.55 per share. Since the price per share in the letter of intent was less than AirNet&#146;s then
net book value per share, AirNet performed the impairment tests required by SFAS No.&nbsp;144 for the
quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2005 and concluded that its long-lived assets used in its Bank Services
and Express Services operations were impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $16.1&nbsp;million
($10.0&nbsp;million net of tax) was recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2005. The impairment charge was based
upon the estimated fair values of the long-lived assets in AirNet&#146;s airline operations derived from
published sources, information provided by a third party valuation firm retained to assist AirNet
in completing its analysis, and the discount inherent in the price per share set forth in the
letter of intent.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s long-lived assets used in its cargo operations, consisting primarily of aircraft and spare
parts, were also determined to be impaired as of September&nbsp;30, 2004. This determination was made
as a result of industry trends in the adoption of electronic payment alternatives and evolving
electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks at a more rapid pace than
previously anticipated by the industry. AirNet determined that its airline capacity would exceed
future demand, which created an impairment of the aircraft and related assets. The impairment also
reflected the overall decline in the market values of the aircraft in its cargo fleet which had not
recovered as in previous economic cycles. AirNet determined that the expected future undiscounted
cash flows from its assets used in its cargo operations were less than the

$43.0&nbsp;million ($31.0&nbsp;million net of tax) was recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2004, using estimated
aircraft fair values. The aircraft fair values used for this purpose were based upon published
market sources as of September&nbsp;30, 2004, which were also used under AirNet&#146;s Amended Credit
Agreement described in Note 4 below.<BR><BR>
Under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, AirNet evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if
changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred sooner. At September&nbsp;30, 2004,
AirNet determined that as a result of the impairment of its long-lived assets used in its Bank
Services and Express Services operations, the remaining goodwill assigned to the cargo operations
should be evaluated for potential impairment. AirNet evaluated the fair value of its goodwill
related to its Bank Services and Express Services operations based upon a discounted future cash
flow analysis. As a result of the impairment test, AirNet determined that its goodwill was
impaired and, accordingly, a non-cash impairment charge of $4.0&nbsp;million was recorded at September
30, 2004. There was no goodwill recorded at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;26, 2006, AirNet, Jetride, and Pinnacle Air, LLC (&#147;Pinnacle&#148;) entered into a purchase
agreement regarding the sale of Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business to Pinnacle (the &#147;Purchase
Agreement&#148;). The sale was completed on September&nbsp;26, 2006. The purchase price was $41.0&nbsp;million
in cash, of which $40.0&nbsp;million was consideration for the sale of nine company-owned aircraft and
related engine maintenance programs and $1.0&nbsp;million was consideration for the sale of all of the
outstanding capital stock of a newly-created subsidiary of Jetride, also called Jetride, Inc. (&#147;New
Jetride&#148;). Upon completion of the sale transaction, Jetride amended its articles of incorporation
to change its name to 7250 STARCHECK, INC. Of the total consideration, $40.0&nbsp;million was paid at
closing and $1.0&nbsp;million was paid into escrow to cover indemnification claims which may be made by
Pinnacle for up to eighteen months after the closing. To the extent the escrow amount is not used
to satisfy indemnification claims, the escrow amount is to be released to AirNet in two
installments approximately six and twelve months after the closing. In March&nbsp;2007, $500,000 of the
escrowed amount was released to AirNet. AirNet retained the net working capital of the Jetride
passenger charter business, which was approximately $2.2&nbsp;million as of the closing date. In
connection with the closing of the sale transaction, Jetride repaid in full six term loans which
had been secured by aircraft used in Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business. The aggregate principal
amount of the loans repaid was approximately $28.2&nbsp;million plus accrued interest and early
termination prepayment penalties of approximately $0.3&nbsp;million through the repayment date.
Following repayment of Jetride&#146;s loans and expenses related to the transaction, AirNet used the
remaining sale proceeds to further reduce debt outstanding under AirNet&#146;s secured revolving credit
facility. AirNet&#146;s lenders under the secured revolving credit facility had consented to the sale
of the Jetride passenger charter business and the various transactions necessary to complete the
sale.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, AirNet has classified the assets and liabilities of Passenger
Charter Services as assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations and presented this
operating segment&#146;s results of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As
a result of the disposition of Passenger Charter Services, AirNet has only one reportable segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from Passenger Charter Services, included in discontinued operations, were approximately
$16.9&nbsp;million, $29.5&nbsp;million and $18.5&nbsp;million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income from
discontinued operations before income taxes for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $0.1&nbsp;million,
$0.8&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million, respectively. Included in the 2006 income from discontinued
operations before income taxes is a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, which is net of
approximately $1.0&nbsp;million of investment banking and legal fees associated with the sale of
Jetride.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2006, AirNet decided to market for sale all nine of the Cessna 310 Piston cargo
aircraft as a result of the need to reduce its airline capacity and operating costs. At that date,
AirNet determined that the plan of sale criteria of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 had been met. The carrying value
of the assets was determined to approximate the estimated fair value less cost to sell, based on
recent aircraft appraisals. The carrying value of the aircraft approximates $0.3&nbsp;million, and is
classified in &#147;Assets held for sale&#148; in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In November&nbsp;2006, AirNet
entered into an agreement to sell all nine of its Cessna 310 aircraft for approximately $0.4
million. AirNet delivered six aircraft in the first quarter of 2007 and expects to deliver the
three remaining aircraft in April of 2007.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2002, AirNet entered into a $35.0&nbsp;million unsecured revolving credit facility and a
five-year $20.0&nbsp;million unsecured term loan (collectively, the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;). The revolving
credit facility under the Credit Agreement was originally scheduled to expire on September&nbsp;30, 2005
and the secured term loan was to mature on September&nbsp;30, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;28, 2004, AirNet and its lenders amended the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement
(the &#147;Amended Credit Agreement&#148;). The Amended Credit Agreement was further amended by the First,
Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Change in Terms Agreements, as described below. The Amended Credit
Agreement was secured by a first lien on all of the property of AirNet and its subsidiaries, other
than any interest in real estate and certain excluded fixed assets. AirNet also pledged the stock
and interests of its subsidiaries to secure the loans under the Amended Credit Agreement, and each
of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries guaranteed AirNet&#146;s obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. The
Amended Credit Agreement also contained certain financial covenants that require AirNet to maintain
a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and to not exceed certain fixed charge coverage and
leverage ratios specified in the Amended Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Amended Credit Agreement initially provided for a secured revolving credit facility of up to
$35.0&nbsp;million and a secured term loan in the aggregate amount of $14.0&nbsp;million. The amount of
revolving loans available under the Amended Credit Agreement was limited to a borrowing base equal
to the aggregate of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 50% of eligible aircraft parts, plus
70% of the market value of certain fixed assets, reduced by the aggregate amount of AirNet&#146;s
outstanding letters of credit. The Amended Credit Agreement bore interest, at AirNet&#146;s option, at
(a)&nbsp;a fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio as defined in
the Amended Credit Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;a floating rate based on the greater of (i)&nbsp;the prime rate
established by The Huntington National Bank from time to time plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s
leverage ratio or (ii)&nbsp;the sum of 0.5% plus the federal funds rate in effect from time to time plus
a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Amended Credit Facility was amended in September&nbsp;2004, March&nbsp;2005, November&nbsp;2005, March&nbsp;2006
and September&nbsp;2006. The above amendments to the Amended Credit Facility were reflected,
respectively, in the &#147;First Change in Terms Agreement&#148;, the &#147;Second Change in Terms Agreement&#148; ,
the &#147;Third Change in Terms Agreement&#148;, the &#147;Fourth Change in Terms Agreement&#148; and the &#147;Fifth Change
in Terms Agreement&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of the impairment charges recorded by AirNet in September&nbsp;2004, September&nbsp;2005 and
September&nbsp;2006, AirNet was not in compliance with certain terms and conditions of the Amended
Credit Facility, including the fixed charge coverage ratio, the leverage ratio and the minimum
consolidated tangible net worth requirement. The First, Third and Fifth Change in Terms Agreements
modified certain financial covenants contained in the Amended Credit Facility in such a manner
that, on a going-forward basis, the impairment charges, in and of themselves, would not cause a
default of these financial covenants in the future. At the same time that the First, Third and
Fifth Change in Terms Agreements were entered into, AirNet and its lenders executed a waiver of any
defaults or potential defaults under the Amended Credit Agreement which occurred, or may have
occurred, as a result of AirNet&#146;s failure to comply with the above financial covenants due to the
various impairment charges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to the amendments made to the Amended Credit Facility to bring the financial covenants
into compliance after the impairment charges recorded in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Amended Credit
Facility was amended on several occasions to modify other terms and conditions of the Amended
Credit Facility. The Second Change in Terms Agreement amended the Amended Credit Facility to
reflect that AirNet had prepaid in full the remaining $11.0&nbsp;million balance outstanding on its
secured term loan. In addition, the Second Change in Terms Agreement reduced the secured revolving
credit facility from $35.0&nbsp;million to $30.0&nbsp;million. The Second Change in Terms Agreement also
extended the term of the Amended Credit Facility from September&nbsp;30, 2005 to October&nbsp;15, 2006. The
Fourth Change in Terms Agreement further extended the term of the Amended Credit Agreement from
October&nbsp;15, 2006 to October&nbsp;15, 2007 and modified the
calculation of the borrowing base. The Fifth Change in Terms Agreement reduced the amount of
the secured revolving credit facility from $25&nbsp;million to $15&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, there was no amount outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet had $1.0&nbsp;million in letters of credit outstanding related to insurance
programs, which reduced the amount available under the revolving credit facility. As of December
31, 2006, AirNet had $14.0&nbsp;million available to borrow under its secured revolving credit facility
under the Amended Credit Agreement.

terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May&nbsp;28, 2004, among
The Huntington National Bank and Bank One, N.A., as lenders, and AirNet, as borrower (as amended
and restated, the &#147;Amended Credit Agreement&#148;) by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement (the &#147;Second Amended Credit Agreement&#148;). The following description of the Second Amended
Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second Amended Credit Agreement.
The Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $15.0&nbsp;million secured revolving credit facility
and expires on October&nbsp;15, 2008. The Second Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a first
priority lien on all of the property of AirNet, other than any interest in real estate and certain
excluded fixed assets. The stock and interests of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries continue to be pledged to
secure the loans under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, and each of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries
continues to guarantee AirNet&#146;s obligations under the Second Amended Credit Agreement under a
Consent and Agreement of Guarantors.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The amount of revolving loans available under the Second Amended Credit Agreement is limited to a
borrowing base equal to the aggregate of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 50% of eligible
aircraft parts. The amount available under the Second Amended
Credit Agreement is also reduced by any outstanding letters of credit issued under the Second
Amended Credit Agreement. The Second Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at AirNet&#146;s option,
at (a)&nbsp;a fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio as defined
in the Second Amended Credit Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;a floating rate based on the greater of (i)&nbsp;the
prime rate established by The Huntington National Bank from time to time plus a margin determined
by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio or (ii)&nbsp;the sum of 0.5% plus the federal funds rate in effect from time
to time plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Second Amended Credit Agreement permits AirNet to maintain and incur other indebtedness in an
aggregate amount of up to $10.0&nbsp;million for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing aircraft and
related tangible fixed assets. The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains certain financial
covenants that require AirNet to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and to not
exceed certain fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios specified in the Second Amended Credit
Agreement. The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains limitations on operating leases,
significant corporate changes including mergers and sales of assets, investments in subsidiaries
and acquisitions, liens, capital expenditures, transactions with affiliates, sales of accounts
receivable, sale and leaseback transactions and other off-balance sheet liabilities, contingent
obligations and hedging transactions.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;24, 2005, AirNet entered into a three-year term loan totaling $11.0&nbsp;million with a fixed
interest rate of 8.12%. This term loan is secured by seven Cessna Caravans and nine Learjet 35
aircraft from AirNet&#146;s cargo aircraft fleet. The aircraft securing this loan were released from
the collateral securing the loans under Amended Credit Agreement in accordance with the Second
Change in Terms Agreement. The proceeds from this term loan were used to prepay in full AirNet&#146;s
term loan under the Amended Credit Agreement as described above. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, $8.0
million was outstanding under this term loan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Term Loans &#150; Discontinued Operations</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the closing of the sale of the Jetride passenger charter business on September
26, 2006, Jetride repaid in full six term loans which had been (a)&nbsp;secured by aircraft used in the
Jetride passenger charter business, and (b)&nbsp;guaranteed by AirNet. In June&nbsp;2004, Jetride entered
into four of the term loans, each with a seven-year term and a fixed interest rate of approximately
6.7%. In July&nbsp;2004, Jetride entered into the other two term loans, each with a seven-year term and
a fixed interest rate of approximately 6.5%. As of September&nbsp;26, 2006 and December&nbsp;31, 2005, there
was an aggregate principal amount of approximately $28.2&nbsp;million and $29.8&nbsp;million, respectively,
outstanding under the six loans. In addition to the outstanding principal amount, Jetride paid
approximately $0.3&nbsp;million in accrued interest and early termination prepayment penalties through
the repayment date. Each of the loan documents and corresponding security and guaranty agreements
entered into in connection with the six term loans was terminated upon repayment of the underlying
term loans at the closing.

restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and performance shares to be paid in common shares and
performance units to be paid in cash (collectively, &#147;2004 Plan Awards&#148;). In addition, the 2004

and conditions applicable to the 2004 Plan Awards, other than non-qualified stock options
automatically granted to non-employee directors of AirNet Systems, Inc. in accordance with the
terms of the 2004 Program. The Compensation Committee also has the authority to establish
administrative rules and regulations regarding the term of each offering under the 2004 Stock
Purchase Plan. In July&nbsp;2005, non-qualified stock options covering 20,000 common shares were
automatically granted under the terms of the 2004 Plan to each of Messrs.&nbsp;Hellerman and Chadwick as
new Directors of AirNet. In December&nbsp;2006, non-qualified stock options covering 150,000 common
shares were granted to Bruce D. Parker, AirNet&#146;s Chief Executive Officer under the terms of an
employment contract. In 2006 and 2005, 16,547 and 23,414 common shares, respectively, were issued
under the 2004 Stock Purchase Program to employees of AirNet and its subsidiaries. The exercise
price of each option has been equal to the fair market price of a common share on the date of
grant. An option&#146;s maximum term is ten years. Option vesting periods range from vesting upon
grant to vesting over four years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet&#146;s stock purchase program, which had been part of the 1996 Plan and is part of the 2004 Plan,
allows eligible employees the opportunity to acquire common shares of AirNet at up to a 15%
discount through payroll deductions. AirNet issued 16,547, 23,414, and 35,914 common shares
respectively during 2006, 2005, and 2004 from treasury shares under the stock purchase program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>6. Lease Obligations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet leases facility space and courier vehicles at various locations throughout the United
States. In January&nbsp;2002, AirNet entered into operating leases for six Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft,
which after certain extensions entered into in September&nbsp;2002, terminate in 2006 and 2007. In
January of 2003 and January of 2006, AirNet entered into two additional operating leases on Cessna
Caravan 208 aircraft that expire, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. In February&nbsp;2006, AirNet entered
into a one-year operating lease on an additional Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2004, AirNet commenced construction of a new corporate and operational facility (the
&#147;Rickenbacker Facility&#148;) on land leased from the Columbus Regional Airport Authority (the
&#147;Authority&#148;). Construction of the Rickenbacker Facility was completed in May of 2005 and AirNet
completed the relocation of its flight and administrative operations to the Rickenbacker Facility
in June of 2005. The land lease with the Authority is for an initial term of 20&nbsp;years which
expires in May&nbsp;2025. AirNet may request two additional 10&nbsp;year extensions of the land lease. In
the event the Authority refuses to extend the land lease for either 10&nbsp;year extension period, the
land lease requires the Authority to purchase AirNet&#146;s leasehold improvements under the Federal
Relocation Act. The purchase price of the improvements cannot be less than 50% of the cost of the
leasehold improvements if the Authority refuses to extend the land lease for the first 10&nbsp;year
extension period and cannot be less than 25% of the cost of the leasehold improvements if the
Authority refuses to extend the land lease for the second 10&nbsp;year extension period. Annual rental
payments under the land lease are set at approximately $39,000, $62,000 and $83,000, respectively,
for the first three years of the lease term. Rental payments after the third year of the lease
term are subject to annual increases based upon the consumer price index.
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet incurred lease expense of $2,455,000, $2,726,000, and $2,883,000 for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, future minimum lease
payments by year under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms exceeding
one year are as follows: 2007 &#151; $681,000; 2008 &#151; $143,000;
2009 &#151; $83,000; 2010 &#151; $83,000; 2011 -
$83,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Concurrently with the sale of AirNet&#146;s Port Columbus Facility in December&nbsp;2004, AirNet entered into
the New Port Columbus Lease. Pursuant to the New Port Columbus Lease, AirNet leased the real
property associated with the Port Columbus Facility and the buildings and all other improvements
thereon pending completion of the construction of AirNet&#146;s new office and hangar facility at
Rickenbacker. The term of the New Port Columbus Lease commenced on December&nbsp;15, 2004 and
terminated on August&nbsp;31, 2005. The New Port Columbus Lease was rent free until May&nbsp;15, 2005 and
commencing May&nbsp;16, 2005, the rent was scheduled to increase to $30,000 per month. The Authority
waived the scheduled rent increase for the period from May&nbsp;16, 2005 until the relocation of AirNet
to its new Rickenbacker Facility. The New Port Columbus Lease was a net lease under which AirNet
was responsible for all costs of operating the Port Columbus Facility. This transaction was a
minor sale-leaseback, as the present value of the rental payments was less than 10% of the
property&#146;s fair value; therefore, AirNet recorded a gain on the sale of $0.3&nbsp;million in 2004.
AirNet relocated from its Port Columbus Facility to the Rickenbacker Facility in June&nbsp;2005.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet has a 401(k) retirement savings plan. All associates who have completed a minimum of one
month of service may contribute up to 60% of their eligible annual earnings to the 401(k)
retirement savings plan, subject to the maximum
limitation imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. AirNet may elect, at its discretion, to make
matching and profit-sharing contributions. AirNet&#146;s contribution expense related to the 401(k)
retirement savings plan for continuing operations totaled $376,000, $358,000, and $492,000 for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">State taxes, net of federal benefit, include a benefit of $158,000 in 2005 as a result of changes
in tax laws in the State of Ohio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;31, 2006, AirNet filed for a discretionary income tax method change with the Internal
Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;). The discretionary method change requires IRS approval prior to the change
being effective. As required by SFAS No.&nbsp;109, the effect of the method change will be reported in
the period in which IRS approval is obtained; therefore, AirNet has not reflected the anticipated
impact of the method change in the December&nbsp;31, 2006 financial statements. There is no certainty as
to what extent or if the IRS will ultimately approve the elected method change as requested.
However, if the method change is approved, it could materially change AirNet&#146;s current taxes
payable, its deferred tax assets and the need for the associated valuation allowance and provide a
significant refund of estimated taxes previously paid.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the 1996 repurchase and cancellation of the Donald Wright Warrant, AirNet
recognized a related tax benefit estimated to be $7.0&nbsp;million based upon management&#146;s judgment and
estimation of the portion of the Donald Wright Warrant which would be deductible for income tax
purposes. This tax benefit was recognized as additional paid-in capital on AirNet&#146;s Consolidated
Balance Sheet and has had no effect on AirNet&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the
third quarter of 2003, this matter was partially resolved and in the fourth quarter of 2006, was
finalized. AirNet has realized tax deductions related to this transaction in excess of
management&#146;s original estimates resulting in additional tax benefits. The additional tax benefits
associated with the deductible portion of the Donald Wright Warrant have exceeded the original
estimate by $1.3&nbsp;million in 2003 and $0.6&nbsp;million in 2006. The additional tax benefits, as was the
initial estimated tax benefit associated with the Donald Wright Warrant, have been recorded as an
increase to additional paid-in capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require AirNet to record a valuation
allowance against future deferred tax assets if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that AirNet will not
be able to utilize such benefits in the future. At December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, AirNet maintained a
valuation allowance of $12.5&nbsp;million and $6.3&nbsp;million, respectively. In 2006, the valuation
allowance offset deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities. In 2005, the valuation
allowance offset AirNet&#146;s net operating loss carry forwards and Alternative Minimum Tax credit
carry forwards.

management, the outcomes of these actions, which are not clearly determinable at the present time,

International Gateway in Columbus, Ohio (the &#147;Port Columbus Facility&#148;) to its new facility at
Rickenbacker International Airport (the &#147;Rickenbacker Facility&#148;). AirNet&#146;s lease of its Port
Columbus Facility expired August&nbsp;31, 2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet also maintained certain assets at Port Columbus for dispensing aviation fuel under the terms
and conditions of a separate lease agreement (the &#147;Fuel Farm Lease&#148;). The Fuel Farm Lease required
AirNet to return the premises leased under the Fuel Farm Lease to their original condition upon the
termination of the lease. In lieu of returning the premises to their original condition, the Fuel
Farm Lease provided that the Port Columbus Airport Authority (the &#147;Authority&#148;) could take title to
any improvements constructed by AirNet on the leased premises. On August&nbsp;17, 2006, AirNet conveyed
all of its fuel farm assets to the Authority for $1 and a release of any future liabilities
associated with the Fuel Farm Lease and the fuel farm assets, other than any liabilities related to
environmental conditions which may be imposed by any governmental agency. The Fuel Farm Lease also
was terminated on August&nbsp;17, 2006. As a result of the conveyance of the fuel farm assets to the
Authority and the termination of the Fuel Farm Lease, AirNet was relieved of its obligation to
return the leased premises to their original condition.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously reported by AirNet Systems, Inc. (&#147;AirNet&#148;), in January&nbsp;2005, AirNet engaged Brown
Gibbons Lang &#038; Company (&#147;BGL&#148;) to serve as AirNet&#146;s exclusive financial advisor and investment
banker to review, develop and evaluate various strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value,
including the possible sale of AirNet. AirNet received indications of

<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">interest with respect to the
sale of AirNet, which culminated in the execution of a letter of intent for the sale of AirNet on
October&nbsp;26, 2005. On December&nbsp;16, 2005, AirNet announced that it had been unable to reach a
definitive merger agreement with the private equity investment firm that entered into the letter of
intent and that the exclusivity period under such letter of intent had been allowed to expire.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Also as previously reported by AirNet, following the termination of the letter of intent, in
December of 2005, the AirNet Board of Directors dissolved the Special Committee which had been
established to oversee the marketing process and appointed a Strategy Committee to work with
management on the ongoing business strategy and alternatives for AirNet to enhance shareholder
value. The Strategy Committee, together with the full Board of Directors, determined that AirNet&#146;s
business strategy would include operating its businesses with an emphasis on cash flows from
operations while seeking other de-leveraging opportunities. The Board of Directors elected to
continue the engagement of BGL as its financial advisor on a month-to-month basis in connection
with the development and evaluation of various strategies and opportunities to enhance shareholder
value and de-leverage the business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously reported by AirNet, in September&nbsp;2006, AirNet sold its Jetride passenger charter
business. Thereafter, AirNet concluded its month-to-month engagement with BGL. However, AirNet
continues to consult with BGL from time-to-time on various strategies and opportunities to enhance
shareholder value. On February&nbsp;27, 2007, the Board of Directors dissolved the Strategy Committee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Amendment of Credit Agreement with The Huntington National Bank</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;29, 2007, AirNet and its lender (The Huntington National Bank) amended and restated the
terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May&nbsp;28, 2004, among
The Huntington National Bank and Bank One, N.A., as lenders, and AirNet, as borrower (as amended
and restated, the &#147;Amended Credit Agreement&#148;) by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement (the &#147;Second Amended Credit Agreement&#148;). The following description of the Second Amended
Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second Amended Credit Agreement,
a copy of which is filed with this Annual Report on Form 10-K as
Exhibit&nbsp;4.50. The Second Amended
Credit Agreement provides for a $15.0&nbsp;million secured revolving credit facility and expires on
October&nbsp;15, 2008. The Second Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on all
of the property of AirNet, other than any interest in real estate and certain excluded fixed
assets. The stock and interests of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries continue to be pledged to secure the
loans under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, and each of AirNet&#146;s subsidiaries continues to
guarantee AirNet&#146;s obligations under the Second Amended Credit Agreement under a Consent and
Agreement of Guarantors.
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The amount of revolving loans available under the Second Amended Credit Agreement is limited to a
borrowing base equal to the aggregate of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 50% of eligible
aircraft parts. The amount available under the Second Amended
Credit Agreement is also reduced by any outstanding letters of credit issued under the Second
Amended Credit Agreement. The Second Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at AirNet&#146;s option,
at (a)&nbsp;a fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio as defined
in the Second Amended Credit Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;a floating rate based on the greater of (i)&nbsp;the
prime rate established by The Huntington National Bank from time to time plus a margin determined
by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio or (ii)&nbsp;the sum of 0.5% plus the federal funds rate in effect from time
to time, plus a margin determined by AirNet&#146;s leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Second Amended Credit Agreement permits AirNet to maintain and incur other indebtedness in an
aggregate amount of up to $10.0&nbsp;million for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing aircraft and
related tangible fixed assets. The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains certain financial
covenants that require AirNet to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and to not
exceed certain fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios specified in the Second Amended Credit
Agreement. The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains limitations on operating leases,
significant corporate changes including mergers and sales of assets, investments in subsidiaries
and acquisitions, liens, capital expenditures, transactions with affiliates, sales of accounts
receivable, sale and leaseback transactions and other off-balance sheet liabilities, contingent
obligations and hedging transactions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of March&nbsp;29, 2007, there were no amounts outstanding under either the Amended Credit Agreement
or under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, which replaced the Amended Credit Agreement. As of
March&nbsp;29, 2007, AirNet had approximately $1.0&nbsp;million in letters of credit outstanding related to
insurance programs, which reduced the amount available under the Second Amended Credit Agreement to
approximately $14&nbsp;million as of March&nbsp;29, 2007.

Committee, adopted the 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#147;2006 Incentive Plan&#148;). The purpose
of the 2006 Incentive Plan was to

Qualmann (Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary), Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. (Senior Vice
President, Express Services), Jeffery B. Harris (Senior Vice President, Bank Services), Ray L.
Druseikis (Controller and Principal Accounting Officer), and Craig A. Leach (Vice President,
Information Systems) &#151; as well as certain department managers and department directors. As of the
start of the 2006 fiscal year, there were 47 participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan. New
employees who qualified for the 2006 Incentive Plan were eligible to participate on the first day
of the calendar quarter following their date of hire. There were 46 participants who received
payments under the 2006 Incentive Plan, including Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff. There were also 32
non-participants who received discretionary awards totaling
approximately $75,000.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Payments under the 2006 Incentive Plan were based upon a combination of AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income (as
determined under the terms of the 2006 Incentive Plan) for the 2006 fiscal year, the operating
performance of AirNet&#146;s Delivery Services and Passenger Charter Services business segments, and the
achievement of personal goals assigned to each participant. The Compensation Committee approved the
personal goals for executive officers and reviewed the personal goals for other participants. The
personal goals approved by the Compensation Committee for each of the executive officers related to
specific business objectives related to general business operations (e.g., regulatory compliance,
expense reductions, etc.) and each business segment (e.g., execution of specific contracts with
customers and vendors, cost reductions, service improvements, etc.).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">No incentive compensation was to be paid under the 2006 Incentive Plan unless AirNet achieved a
designated threshold level of pre-tax income for the 2006 fiscal year. If the designated threshold
level were achieved, incentive compensation payments would increase based upon predetermined
pre-tax income levels until a maximum aggregate amount of $1.9&nbsp;million in incentive compensation
payments was reached. After the overall amount of incentive compensation was determined based upon
AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income for the 2006 fiscal year, incentive compensation was allocated to
individual participants based upon the following four factors: (i)&nbsp;level of pre-tax income attained
by AirNet; (ii)&nbsp;level of contribution margin attained by Delivery Services as compared to certain
predetermined levels; (iii)&nbsp;levels of contribution margin attained by Passenger Charter Services as
compared to certain predetermined levels; and (iv)&nbsp;attainment of personal goals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Originally, a participant&#146;s maximum incentive compensation payment was to range from 20% to 100% of
the participant&#146;s base salary, depending upon such participant&#146;s level of responsibility for
achieving AirNet&#146;s goals for the 2006 fiscal year. Twenty percent of each participant&#146;s incentive
compensation payments was to be based upon the participant&#146;s achievement of pre-established
personal goals. The remaining 80% of each participant&#146;s incentive compensation payment was to be
based upon a combination of the other three factors discussed above, which were allocated to each
participant based upon such participant&#146;s overall responsibility for attaining the designated
levels of AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income and contribution margins for the Delivery Services and Passenger

Incentive Plan based upon AirNet&#146;s level of pre-tax income were not paid to certain participants as
a result of those participants&#146; failure to attain their personal goals or AirNet&#146;s failure to
attain the predetermined levels of budgeted contribution margins in Delivery Services or Passenger
Charter Services, such unpaid amounts could have been awarded at the discretion of the Compensation
Committee to participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan or to other employees of AirNet not

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Except for payments to the executive officers, payments under the 2006 Incentive Plan were paid in
quarterly payments commencing with the second quarter of the 2006 fiscal year based upon AirNet&#146;s
year-to-date financial performance. Except as described below with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff,
payments of incentive compensation to executive officers were made in March&nbsp;2007 based upon
AirNet&#146;s performance and each executive officer&#146;s performance for the 2006 fiscal year. Except as
described below with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff, in order to receive payment, a participant must
have been actively employed by AirNet at the time the payment was made.

Committee, adopted the following amendments to the 2006 Incentive Plan: (i)&nbsp;for purposes of
computing the pre-tax income of AirNet for the 2006 fiscal year for purposes of the 2006 Incentive
Plan, the $24.6&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge recorded by AirNet in the third quarter of the
2006 fiscal year was to be disregarded and AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income for the 2006 fiscal year was to
be computed as if no impairment charge had been incurred; (ii)&nbsp;the incentive compensation payable
under the 2006 Incentive Plan to each of AirNet&#146;s officers, Joel E. Biggerstaff, Gary W. Qualmann,
Larry M. Glasscock, Jr., Jeffery B. Harris, Ray L. Druseikis and
Craig A. Leach, was to
be reduced to 60% of the amount each such officer would otherwise have been entitled to receive
under the 2006 Incentive Plan; (iii)&nbsp;for purposes of the 2006 Incentive Plan, the gain on the sale
of Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business was to be excluded from the computation of AirNet&#146;s pre-tax
income for the 2006 fiscal year; and (iv)&nbsp;Jetride&#146;s targeted pre-tax income for the fourth quarter
of 2006 was to be disregarded for purposes of the 2006 Incentive Plan and the predetermined pre-tax
income level at which the maximum incentive compensation payout would be reached under the 2006
Incentive Plan was to be reduced by a comparable amount.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously reported, under the terms of the Separation Agreement and General Release, dated as
of December&nbsp;28, 2006 (the &#147;Separation Agreement&#148;), between AirNet and Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff, the

performance criteria, on an equitable basis with the other executive officers of AirNet. While
AirNet exceeded the level of pre-tax income at which the maximum incentive compensation payments
could be achieved, AirNet did not attain its pre-determined goal for contribution margin for
Passenger Charter Services. Accordingly, Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff was not entitled to the 20% of his
incentive compensation potential based upon the performance of AirNet&#146;s Passenger Charter Services
business. Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff was paid 60% of his remaining 80% incentive compensation potential, or
$156,000, after applying the 60% limitation described above.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">After reviewing AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income, the operating performance of AirNet&#146;s various business
components and the level of achievement of the personal goals assigned to each executive officer,
at a meeting of the Compensation Committee held on February&nbsp;27, 2007, the Compensation Committee
asked Mr.&nbsp;Parker, AirNet&#146;s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, to recommend
additional discretionary awards to officers, other participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan, and
certain other employees who were not participants in the 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan. The
Compensation Committee met again on March&nbsp;5, 2007 and approved discretionary awards recommended by
Mr.&nbsp;Parker in the amount of $283,000. The amounts of such
discretionary awards were based upon the
contributions such officers, participants and other employees made to the operating performance of
AirNet during fiscal year 2006, as determined by Mr.&nbsp;Parker. Because of such discretionary
incentive compensation awards, the total incentive compensation payments made to certain executive
officers of AirNet exceeded the amounts that otherwise would have been paid given the 60%
limitation described above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the 2006 fiscal year and the fiscal quarter ending March&nbsp;31, 2007, AirNet made payments
under the terms of the 2006 Incentive Plan in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.5&nbsp;million,
which included $156,000 paid to Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff as described above. In March of 2007, the
following executive officers of AirNet were paid the following amounts under the 2006 Incentive
Plan: Jeffery B. Harris- $160,000; Gary W. Qualmann &#151; $136,750; Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. &#151; $125,000;

Facility LC shall be satisfactory to Lender and that the Borrower shall have executed and delivered
such application agreement and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to such Facility
LC as Lender shall have reasonably requested (each, a &#147;Facility LC Application&#148;). In the event of
any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the

or other formalities of any kind; <I>provided </I>that the Borrower shall not hereby be precluded from
asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower to the

terms of such Facility LC or (ii)&nbsp;Lender&#146;s failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by it after
the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such

satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article&nbsp;IV), unless directed
otherwise by the Borrower, Lender shall make a Floating Rate Revolving Advance hereunder for the

obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Floating Rate
Revolving Advance.

2.19 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any
setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against Lender
or any beneficiary of a Facility LC. The Borrower further agrees that Lender shall not be
responsible for, and the Borrower&#146;s Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC shall
not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any
endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower, any of its Affiliates,
the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing institution or other party to whom any Facility
LC may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower or of any of its
Affiliates against the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any such transferee. Lender shall not be
liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any
message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC, except for its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by Lender
under or in connection with each Facility LC and the related drafts and documents, if done without
gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not put Lender
under any liability to the Borrower. Nothing in this Section&nbsp;2.19.6 is intended to limit the right
of the Borrower to make a claim against Lender for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the

signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal
counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by Lender.

harmless Lender, and its directors, officers, agents and employees from and against any and all
claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which Lender may incur (or which may be
claimed against Lender by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection with the issuance,
execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Facility LC or any
actual or proposed use of any Facility LC, including any claims, damages, losses, liabilities,
costs or expenses which Lender may incur by reason of or on account of Lender issuing any Facility
LC which specifies that the term &#147;Beneficiary&#148; included therein includes any successor by operation
of law of the named Beneficiary, but which Facility LC does not require that any drawing by any
such successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory to Lender,
evidencing the appointment of such successor Beneficiary; <I>provided </I>that the Borrower shall not be
required to indemnify Lender for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the

possible Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar
Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to Lender, as applicable, under Sections&nbsp;3.1, 3.2 and
3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Advances under Section&nbsp;3.3, so long as such
designation is not, in the reasonable judgment of Lender, disadvantageous to Lender. Lender shall
deliver a written statement to the Borrower as to the amount due, if any, under Section&nbsp;3.1, 3.2,
3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon
which Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in
the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection
with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though Lender funded each Eurodollar Loan or made any
disbursement under each Facility LC, as applicable, through the purchase of a deposit of the type
and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate
applicable to such Loan or Facility LC, whether or not that is in fact the case, and any amounts
owing by Borrower to Lender under such Sections shall not be deemed unreasonable or not properly
documented as a result of whether or not Lender funded any Eurodollar Loan or whether or not Lender
made any disbursement under any Facility LC in such manner. Unless otherwise provided herein, the
amount specified in the written statement of Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the
Borrower of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections&nbsp;3.1, 3.2, 3.4

termination of this Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;the date that the event giving rise to the obligation

Administrative Agent, which appointment shall be subject to the consent of Borrower as long as no
Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such appointment. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Lender within thirty days after the

hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such
successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of

a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed
Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Administrative
Agent, the resigning or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or
removal of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article&nbsp;IX shall continue in effect for
the benefit of such Administrative Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section
9.12, then the term &#147;Prime Rate&#148; as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or
other analogous rate of the new Administrative Agent.

Administrative Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates.
Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate&#146;s directors, officers, agents and employees) which performs
duties in connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the same benefits of the

electronic data processing system and/or internal memoranda maintained by Lender, or to otherwise
record in accordance with its usual practice, the date and amount of each such Loan and the date

sums shown on such schedule, the most recent printout from Lender&#146;s electronic data processing
system and/or such memoranda shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of the amount of the
outstanding principal, interest or any other amount due under this Note; <I>provided, however</I>, that
the failure of Lender to make any such entry(s) shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to
repay outstanding principal, interest or any other amount due under this Note in accordance with
the terms hereof.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Note is issued pursuant to, and is entitled to the benefits of, the Second Amended and

the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, to which Agreement reference is hereby made for a
statement of the terms and conditions governing this Note, including the terms and conditions under
which this Note may be prepaid or its maturity date accelerated. Capitalized terms used herein and
not otherwise defined herein are used with the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Note is given as an amendment and restatement for and as evidence of the indebtedness
previously evidenced by that certain (i)&nbsp;Note dated May&nbsp;28, 2004 given by Borrower in favor of
Lender in the face amount of $18,750,000.00 (as amended from time to time, the &#147;HNB Note&#148;), and
(ii)&nbsp;Note dated May&nbsp;28, 2004 given by Borrower in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, a national banking
association (&#147;JPM&#148;) formerly known as Bank One, N.A. (Columbus) in the face amount of
$11,250,000.00 (as amended from time to time, the &#147;JPM Note&#148;), the outstanding principal
indebtedness, as of the date hereof, of (i)&nbsp;the HNB Note being Zero Dollars ($0) and (ii)&nbsp;the JPM
Note being Zero Dollars ($0); with said JPM Note having been assigned by JPM to Lender pursuant to
the Assignment Agreement dated of even date herewith by and between Lender and JPM, as Assignee and
Assignor, respectively. The HNB Note and the JPM Note were executed and delivered by Borrower
pursuant to the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The maximum principal amount
available under the &#147;Commitment&#148; (as defined in the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement)
and under the HNB Note and the JPM Note has been reduced from time to time, and, ultimately,
pursuant to that certain Fifth Change in Terms Agreement dated November&nbsp;10, 2006, by and among
Borrower, Lender in its capacity as Administrative Agent for the benefit of the &#147;Lenders&#148; (as such
term is defined thereunder), and such &#147;Lenders&#148; (inclusive of JPM and Lender), the maximum

refinance of the &#147;Commitment&#148; referenced above or the outstanding principal balance of the HNB Note
or the JPM Note, and the Agreement does not constitute or represent a novation of the First Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement, and this Note and the obligations and liabilities under the
Agreement and all other Loan Documents shall remain secured by all mortgage liens, security
interests, pledges, and other interests given, by Borrower, each Guarantor and any other Person, to
secure the HNB Note and/or the JPM Note, this Note and/or the obligations under the Agreement and

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet is liable for remedial activities relating to releases from two Underground Storage Tanks on
property at a local airport that it operated under lease from Oakland County. The releases were of
jet and airplane fuel which reached and impacted groundwater. Although it has taken significant
time (roughly 16&nbsp;years since the original discovery), significant progress has been made and the
plume of contaminants is as dilute and narrow as it has been. MDEQ, the relevant regulatory body
appears content to allow AirNet to complete its relatively slow, low-tech, low cost remedial action
with the necessary confirmatory testing. Each round of treatment (about one a year) costs roughly
$5,000 and each round of testing (about one per year) costs roughly $4,000. More testing would be
required to reach closure and so it could cost at least $17,000 &#151; $20,000 to bring this to closure.
It may cost more but for each year that it is not complete, one can add roughly $9,000 to the cost
estimate to close this out.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">AirNet was also sued by a neighbor whose property covers a small part of the plume emanating from
the former AirNet operation. The suit was settled in April of 2003 for $65,000.00 and a commitment
by AirNet to achieve an MDEQ approved closure with respect to the neighbor&#146;s property either
through the treatment regime described above or through the imposition of a deed restriction on the
neighbor&#146;s property in April&nbsp;2005 and approval of same by the MDEQ as closure.

Loans made by Lender to the Borrower pursuant to Article&nbsp;II of the Agreement (as hereinafter
defined), in immediately available funds at the main office of Lender, together with interest
thereon at the rate or rates set forth in the Agreement. The Borrower shall pay the principal of
and accrued and unpaid interest on such Loans as set forth in the Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lender shall, and is hereby authorized to, record by entries made by Lender into its
electronic data processing system and/or internal memoranda maintained by Lender, or to otherwise
record in accordance with its usual practice, the date and amount of each such Loan and the date
and amount of each principal and interest payment hereunder. The Borrower agrees that the sum or
sums shown on such schedule, the most recent printout from Lender&#146;s electronic data processing
system and/or such memoranda shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of the amount of the
outstanding principal, interest or any other amount due under this Note; <I>provided, however</I>, that
the failure of Lender to make any such entry(s) shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to
repay outstanding principal, interest or any other amount due under this Note in accordance with
the terms hereof.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Note is issued pursuant to, and is entitled to the benefits of, the Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March&nbsp;29, 2007 (which, as it may be amended, modified,
supplemented, extended, restated and/or replaced from time to time, is herein called the
&#147;Agreement&#148;), between the Borrower and Lender, which was given as an amendment and restatement to
the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, to which Agreement reference is hereby made for a
statement of the terms and conditions governing this Note, including the terms and conditions under
which this Note may be prepaid or its maturity date accelerated. Capitalized terms used herein and
not otherwise defined herein are used with the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Note is given as an amendment and restatement for and as evidence of the indebtedness
previously evidenced by that certain (i)&nbsp;Note dated May&nbsp;28, 2004 given by Borrower in favor of
Lender in the face amount of $18,750,000.00 (as amended from time to time, the &#147;HNB Note&#148;), and
(ii)&nbsp;Note dated May&nbsp;28, 2004 given by Borrower in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, a national banking
association (&#147;JPM&#148;) formerly known as Bank One, N.A. (Columbus) in the face amount of
$11,250,000.00 (as amended from time to time, the &#147;JPM Note&#148;), the outstanding principal
indebtedness, as of the date hereof, of (i)&nbsp;the HNB Note being Zero Dollars ($0), and (ii)&nbsp;the JPM
Note being Zero Dollars ($0); with said JPM Note having been assigned by JPM to Lender pursuant to
the Assignment Agreement dated of even date herewith by and between Lender and JPM, as Assignee and
Assignor, respectively. The HNB Note and the JPM Note were executed and delivered by Borrower
pursuant to the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The maximum principal amount
available under the &#147;Commitment&#148; (as defined in the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement)
and under the HNB Note and the JPM Note has been reduced from time to time, and, ultimately,
pursuant to that certain Fifth Change in Terms Agreement dated November&nbsp;10, 2006, by and among
Borrower, Lender in its capacity as Administrative Agent for the benefit of the &#147;Lenders&#148; (as such
term is defined thereunder), and such &#147;Lenders&#148; (inclusive of JPM and Lender), the maximum
outstanding principal indebtedness available under (i)&nbsp;said &#147;Commitment&#148; was reduced to
$15,000,000.00, (ii)&nbsp;the HNB Note was reduced to $9,375,000.00, and (iii)&nbsp;the JMP Note was reduced
to $5,625,000.00.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, this Note does not constitute a novation of the HNB Note or the JPM Note or a
refinance of the &#147;Commitment&#148; referenced above or the outstanding principal balance of the HNB Note
or the JPM Note, and the Agreement does not constitute or represent a novation of the First Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement, and this Note and the obligations and liabilities under the
Agreement and all other Loan Documents shall remain secured by all mortgage liens, security
interests, pledges, and other interests given, by Borrower, each Guarantor and any other Person, to
secure the HNB Note and/or the JPM Note, this Note and/or the obligations under the Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.

same becomes due as herein provided in any court of record situated in the county where this
warrant was signed (being Franklin County, Ohio), or in the county where the Borrower then resides
or can be found, to waive the issuing and service of process, and confess a judgment in favor of
the holder of this Note against the Borrower, for the amount that may then be due, with interest at
the rate(s) provided for herein, together with the costs of suit, and to waive and release all

who has served at least one full one-year term as an ELIGIBLE DIRECTOR is to automatically be
granted a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 4,000 common shares, $0.01 par value (the &#147;COMMON

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the parties hereto make the following

recognized market or quotation system upon or through which the COMPANY&#146;s COMMON SHARES are then
listed or traded) without the prior approval of the COMPANY&#146;s shareholders.

an additional 800 of the COMMON SHARES subject to the OPTION, provided
that the OPTIONEE is a director of the COMPANY on such anniversary date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any exercise of the vested and exercisable portion of the OPTION may be made in whole or in
part; however, no single purchase of COMMON SHARES upon exercise of the OPTION may be for fewer

as to certain COMMON SHARES, the OPTION will remain vested and exercisable as to those COMMON

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) <U>Method of Exercise</U>. The OPTION may be exercised by the OPTIONEE (or in the event
of the OPTIONEE&#146;s death, the OPTIONEE&#146;s BENEFICIARY as determined pursuant to the provisions of the
PLAN) giving written notice of exercise to the BOARD, in care of the Chief Financial Officer of the
COMPANY, stating the number of COMMON SHARES subject to the OPTION in respect of which the OPTION
is being exercised. Payment for all such COMMON SHARES must be made to the COMPANY at the time the
OPTION is exercised in United States dollars in cash (including check, bank draft or money order
payable to the order of the COMPANY). Payment for such COMMON SHARES may also be made (i)&nbsp;by
tender of COMMON SHARES already owned by the OPTIONEE for at least six months (either by actual
delivery of the already-owned COMMON SHARES or by attestation) and having a fair market value
(based on the closing sale price of the COMMON SHARES of the COMPANY as reported on AMEX or, if the
COMMON SHARES are not traded on AMEX, &#147;fair market value&#148; as defined in the PLAN) on the date of
tender equal to the EXERCISE PRICE or (ii)&nbsp;by a combination of the delivery of cash and the tender
of already-owned COMMON SHARES. After payment in full for the COMMON SHARES purchased under the
OPTION has been made, the COMPANY will take all such actions as are necessary to deliver an
appropriate share certificate evidencing the COMMON SHARES purchased upon the exercise of the
OPTION as promptly thereafter as is reasonably practicable.

merger, consolidation, combination, spin-off, distribution of assets to shareholders, exchange of
shares, or other similar corporate change affecting the COMMON SHARES, the BOARD will appropriately
adjust the number of COMMON SHARES subject to the OPTION as well as the EXERCISE PRICE and any
other factors, limits or terms affecting the OPTION.

acquired the COMPANY&#146;s assets and the terms of that plan or agreement are binding on all holders of
COMMON SHARES (except to the extent that dissenting shareholders are entitled to relief under
applicable law), then the unexercised portion of the OPTION (whether or not then vested and
exercisable by its terms) will become immediately vested and exercisable in full and the OPTIONEE

OPTIONEE&#146;s guardian or legal representative. If the BOARD permits the transfer of the OPTION, the

administratively possible after the date of the BUY OUT NOTICE. At the BOARD&#146;s option, payment of
the buy out amount may be made in cash, in whole COMMON SHARES or partly in cash and partly in
whole COMMON SHARES. The number of whole COMMON SHARES, if any, included in the buy out amount

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
Effective May 27, 1998, AirNet established the AirNet Systems, Inc. Director Deferred Compensation Plan
(the &#147;Director Deferred Plan&#148;).  The Director Deferred Plan as in effect on March 30, 2007 has previously
been filed as Exhibit 10.7 to AirNet&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2003.  Voluntary participation in the Director Deferred Plan enables a Non-Employee Director of AirNet to
defer all or a part of his director&#146;s fees, including federal income tax thereon.  Such deferred fees may be
credited to (i) a cash account where the funds will earn interest at the rate prescribed in the Director
Deferred Plan, or (ii) a stock account where the funds will be converted into a common share  equivalent
(determined by dividing the amount to be allocated to the Non-Employee Director&#146;s stock account by the fair
market value of AirNet&#146;s common shares when the credit to the stock account is made).  In his deferral
election, a Non-Employee Director will elect whether distribution of the amount in his account(s) under the
Director Deferred Plan is to be made in a single lump sum payment or in equal annual installments, payable
over a period of not more than ten years.  Distributions will commence within 30 days of the earlier of (a) the
date specified by a Non-Employee Director at the time a deferral election is made or (b) the date the Non-
Employee Director ceases to so serve.  Cash accounts will be distributed in the form of cash and stock
accounts will be distributed in the form of common shares or cash, as selected by AirNet.  As of March 30,
2007, none of the Non-Employee Directors was participating in the Director Deferred Plan.

Non-Employee Directors were automatically granted options to purchase AirNet common shares in

 AirNet&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.  On March 7, 1997,
each individual then serving as a Non-Employee Director was automatically granted an immediately
exercisable option to purchase 2,000 AirNet common shares with an exercise price equal to the fair market
value of the common shares on the grant date.  On August 19, 1998, each individual then serving as a Non-
Employee Director was automatically granted an option to purchase 20,000 AirNet common shares with an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common shares on the grant date.  Each option granted

shares effective on the date of his election or appointment to the Board.  In addition, on the first business
day of each of the 2002, 2003 and 2004 fiscal years of AirNet, each individual who was then serving as a
Non-Employee Director and had served for at least one full one-year term as a Non-Employee Director, was
 automatically granted an option to purchase 4,000 AirNet common shares.  All of these options were
granted with an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of the common shares on the
respective grant date.  In addition, all of these options have vested and are to vest and become exercisable

elected or appointed as a Non-Employee Director after June 4, 2004 has been and is to be granted an
option to purchase 20,000 AirNet common shares effective on the date of his election or appointment to the

exercise price per share equal to the closing price of the underlying common shares as reported on the
American Stock Exchange LLC (&#147;AMEX&#148;) on the grant date (or, if the grant date is not a trading day on
AMEX, on the first trading day following the grant date).  Each such option, which has not expired, been
cancelled or been exercised prior to the effective date of the event, will become fully exercisable (i) if the
Non-Employee Director retires from service as an AirNet director after having served at least one full one-
year term, becomes totally disabled or dies or (ii) if AirNet undergoes a merger or consolidation or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;24, 2006, the Board of Directors of AirNet, upon the recommendation of the Compensation
Committee, adopted the 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#147;2006 Incentive Plan&#148;). The purpose
of the 2006 Incentive Plan was to promote the following goals of AirNet for the fiscal year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006 (the 2006 fiscal year&#148;) by providing incentive compensation to certain employees
of AirNet and its subsidiaries:

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan included the following individuals who served as executive
officers of AirNet during the 2006 fiscal year: Joel E. Biggerstaff (Chairman of the Board until
December&nbsp;31, 2006 and Chief Executive Officer and President until December&nbsp;28, 2006), Gary W.
Qualmann (Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary), Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. (Senior Vice
President, Express Services), Jeffery B. Harris (Senior Vice President, Bank Services), Ray L.
Druseikis (Controller and Principal Accounting Officer), and Craig A. Leach (Vice President,
Information Systems) &#150; as well as certain department managers and department directors. As of the
start of the 2006 fiscal year, there were 47 participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan. New
employees who qualified for the 2006 Incentive Plan were eligible to participate on the first day
of the calendar quarter following their date of hire. There were 46 participants who received
payments under the 2006 Incentive Plan, including Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff. There were also 32
non-participants who received discretionary awards totaling
approximately $75,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Payments under the 2006 Incentive Plan were based upon a combination of AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income (as
determined under the terms of the 2006 Incentive Plan) for the 2006 fiscal year, the operating
performance of AirNet&#146;s Delivery Services and Passenger Charter Services business segments, and the
achievement of personal goals assigned to each participant. The Compensation Committee approved the
personal goals for executive officers and reviewed the personal goals for other participants. The
personal goals approved by the Compensation Committee for each of the executive officers related to
specific business objectives related to general business operations (e.g., regulatory compliance,
expense reductions, etc.) and each business segment (e.g., execution of specific contracts with
customers and vendors, cost reductions, service improvements, etc.).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">No incentive compensation was to be paid under the 2006 Incentive Plan unless AirNet achieved a
designated threshold level of pre-tax income for the 2006 fiscal year. If the designated threshold
level were achieved, incentive compensation payments would increase based upon predetermined
pre-tax income levels until a maximum aggregate amount of $1.9&nbsp;million in incentive compensation
payments was reached. After the overall amount of incentive compensation was determined based upon
AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income for the 2006 fiscal year, incentive compensation was allocated to
individual participants based upon the following four factors: (i)&nbsp;level of pre-tax income attained
by AirNet; (ii)&nbsp;level of contribution margin attained by Delivery Services as compared to certain
predetermined levels; (iii)&nbsp;levels of contribution margin attained by Passenger Charter Services as
compared to certain predetermined levels; and (iv)&nbsp;attainment of personal goals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Originally, a participant&#146;s maximum incentive compensation payment was to range from 20% to 100% of
the participant&#146;s base salary, depending upon such participant&#146;s level of responsibility for
achieving AirNet&#146;s goals for the 2006 fiscal year. Twenty percent of each participant&#146;s incentive
compensation payments was to be based upon the participant&#146;s achievement of pre-established
personal goals. The remaining 80% of each participant&#146;s incentive compensation payment was to be
based upon a combination of the other three factors discussed above, which were allocated to each
participant based upon such participant&#146;s overall responsibility for attaining the designated
levels of AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income and contribution margins for the Delivery Services and Passenger
Charter Services business segments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the event the incentive compensation payments otherwise available for payment under the 2006
Incentive Plan based upon AirNet&#146;s level of pre-tax income were not paid to certain participants as
a result of those participants&#146; failure to attain their personal goals or AirNet&#146;s failure to
attain the predetermined levels of budgeted contribution margins in Delivery Services or Passenger
Charter Services, such unpaid amounts could have been awarded at the discretion of the Compensation
Committee to participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan or to other employees of AirNet not
participating in the 2006 Incentive Plan.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Except for payments to the executive officers, payments under the 2006 Incentive Plan were paid in
quarterly payments commencing with the second quarter of the 2006 fiscal year based upon AirNet&#146;s
year-to-date financial performance. Except as described below with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff,
payments of incentive compensation to executive officers were made in March&nbsp;2007 based upon
AirNet&#146;s performance and each executive officer&#146;s performance for the 2006 fiscal year. Except as
described below with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff, in order to receive payment, a participant must
have been actively employed by AirNet at the time the payment was made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;8, 2006, the AirNet Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation
Committee, adopted the following amendments to the 2006 Incentive Plan: (i)&nbsp;for purposes of
computing the pre-tax income of AirNet for the 2006 fiscal year for purposes of the 2006 Incentive
Plan, the $24.6&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge recorded by AirNet in the third quarter of the
2006 fiscal year was to be disregarded and AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income for the 2006 fiscal year was to
be computed as if no impairment charge had been incurred; (ii)&nbsp;the incentive compensation payable
under the 2006 Incentive Plan to each of AirNet&#146;s officers, Joel E. Biggerstaff, Gary W. Qualmann,
Larry M. Glasscock, Jr., Jeffery B. Harris, Ray L. Druseikis and
Craig A. Leach, was to
be reduced to 60% of the amount each such officer would otherwise have been entitled to receive
under the 2006 Incentive Plan; (iii)&nbsp;for purposes of the 2006 Incentive Plan, the gain on the sale
of Jetride&#146;s passenger charter business was to be excluded from the computation of AirNet&#146;s pre-tax
income for the 2006 fiscal year; and (iv)&nbsp;Jetride&#146;s targeted pre-tax income for the fourth quarter
of 2006 was to be disregarded for purposes of the 2006 Incentive Plan and the predetermined pre-tax income level at which the maximum
incentive compensation payout would be reached under the 2006 Incentive Plan was to be reduced by a
comparable amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously reported, under the terms of the Separation Agreement and General Release, dated as
of December&nbsp;28, 2006 (the &#147;Separation Agreement&#148;), between AirNet and Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff, the
incentive compensation payable under the 2006 Incentive Plan to Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff was calculated
without regard to his personal goals for the 2006 fiscal year and, with respect to the financial
performance criteria, on an equitable basis with the other executive officers of AirNet. While
AirNet exceeded the level of pre-tax income at which the maximum incentive compensation payments
could be achieved, AirNet did not attain its pre-determined goal for contribution margin for
Passenger Charter Services. Accordingly, Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff was not entitled to the 20% of his
incentive compensation potential based upon the performance of AirNet&#146;s Passenger Charter Services
business. Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff was paid 60% of his remaining 80% incentive compensation potential, or
$156,000, after applying the 60% limitation described above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">After reviewing AirNet&#146;s pre-tax income, the operating performance of AirNet&#146;s various business
components and the level of achievement of the personal goals assigned to each executive officer,
at a meeting of the Compensation Committee held on February&nbsp;27, 2007, the Compensation Committee
asked Mr.&nbsp;Parker, AirNet&#146;s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, to recommend
additional discretionary awards to officers, other participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan, and
certain other employees who were not participants in the 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan. The
Compensation Committee met again on March&nbsp;5, 2007 and approved discretionary awards recommended by
Mr.&nbsp;Parker in the amount of $283,000. The amounts of such
discretionary awards were based upon the
contributions such officers, participants and other employees made to the operating performance of
AirNet during fiscal year 2006, as determined by Mr.&nbsp;Parker. Because of such discretionary
incentive compensation awards, the total incentive compensation payments made to certain executive
officers of AirNet exceeded the amounts that otherwise would have been paid given the 60%
limitation described above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the 2006 fiscal year and the fiscal quarter ending March&nbsp;31, 2007, AirNet made payments
under the terms of the 2006 Incentive Plan in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.5&nbsp;million,
which included $156,000 paid to Mr.&nbsp;Biggerstaff as described above. In March of 2007, the
following executive officers of AirNet were paid the following amounts under the 2006 Incentive
Plan: Jeffery B. Harris- $160,000; Gary W. Qualmann &#151; $136,750; Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. &#151; $125,000;
Craig A. Leach &#151; $66,464; and Ray L. Druseikis -$46,550.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Stock Option Agreement (this &#147;Agreement&#148;) is made to be effective as of December&nbsp;28, 2006
(the &#147;Grant Date&#148;), by and between AirNet Systems, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and
Bruce D. Parker (the &#147;Optionee&#148;).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the provisions of the AirNet Systems, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (as
amended, the &#147;Plan&#148;), the Compensation Committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board of Directors of the
Company administers the Plan; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company has offered and the Optionee has accepted employment with the Company;
and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in connection with the Optionee&#146;s employment with the Company, the Company has agreed
to grant nonstatutory stock options to the Optionee under the Plan; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that nonstatutory stock options to acquire an aggregate
of 150,000 common shares, $0.01 par value (the &#147;Common Shares&#148;), of the Company should be granted
to the Optionee under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the parties hereto make the following
agreement, intending to be legally bound thereby:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Grant of Options</U>. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee nonstatutory stock
options (the &#147;Options&#148;) to purchase an aggregate of 150,000 Common Shares of the Company. The
Optionee may acquire one Common Share for each Option granted under the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. The Options are not intended to qualify as incentive
stock options under Section&nbsp;422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Terms and Conditions of the Options</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) <U>Exercise Price</U>. The exercise price (the &#147;Exercise Price&#148;) to be paid by the
Optionee to the Company upon the exercise of the Options will be $2.95 per share, which was the
closing price of the Common Shares of the Company as reported on the American Stock Exchange
(&#147;AMEX&#148;) on the Grant Date. The Options may not be &#147;repriced&#148; (as defined under the rules adopted
by the national securities exchange or other recognized market or quotation system upon or through
which the Company&#146;s Common Shares are then listed or traded) without the prior approval of the
Company&#146;s shareholders.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) <U>Exercise of the Options</U>. The Options vested and became exercisable immediately
upon grant as to 75,000 of the Common Shares subject to the Options. Except as otherwise provided
in Section&nbsp;6 of this Agreement, on December&nbsp;27, 2007, the Options will vest and become exercisable
as to the remaining 75,000 Common Shares subject to the Options, provided that the Optionee remains
employed by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company on December&nbsp;27, 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any exercise of the vested and exercisable portion of the Options may be made in whole or in
part; however, no single purchase of Common Shares upon exercise of the Options may be for fewer
than the smaller of: (a)&nbsp;100 Common Shares or (b)&nbsp;the full number of Common Shares as to which the
Options are then vested and exercisable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, if the Options vest and become exercisable
as to certain Common Shares, the Options will remain vested and exercisable as to those Common
Shares until the date of expiration of the term of the Options.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant of the Options does not confer upon the Optionee any right to continue as an
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or limit in any way the right of the Company or

conditions of the Employment Agreement, entered into on December&nbsp;28, 2006, by the Company and the
Optionee (the &#147;Employment Agreement&#148;), applicable law and the Company&#146;s or the applicable
subsidiary&#146;s governing corporate documents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) <U>Option Term</U>. The Options will in no event be exercisable after December&nbsp;27, 2016.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) <U>Method of Exercise</U>. The Options may be exercised by giving written notice of
exercise to the Company, in care of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, stating the number
of Common Shares subject to the Options in respect of which the Options are being exercised.
Payment for all such Common Shares must be made to the Company at the time the Options are
exercised in United States dollars in cash (including check, bank draft or money order payable to
the order of the Company). Payment for such Common Shares may also be made (i)&nbsp;by tender of Common
Shares already owned by the Optionee for at least six months (either by actual delivery of the
already-owned Common Shares or by attestation) and having a fair market value (based on the closing
sale price of the Common Shares of the Company as reported on AMEX or, if the Common Shares are not
traded on AMEX, &#147;fair market value&#148; as defined in the Plan) on the date of tender equal to the
Exercise Price, (ii)&nbsp;by a combination of the delivery of cash and the tender of already-owned
Common Shares, or (iii)&nbsp;in such other manner as the Committee may determine to be permissible under
the terms of the Plan. After payment in full for the Common Shares purchased under the Options has
been made, the Company will take all such actions as are necessary to deliver appropriate share
certificates evidencing the Common Shares purchased upon the exercise of the Options as promptly
thereafter as is reasonably practicable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) <U>Tax Withholding</U>. The Company will withhold from other amounts owed to the
Optionee, or require the Optionee to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal,
state and local withholding tax requirements in respect of the exercise of the Options. These
withholding tax requirements may be satisfied in one of several ways, including:

payable to the order of the Company) equal to the amount required to be withheld or tender
Common Shares of the Company already owned by the Optionee for at least six months (either
by actual delivery of the already-owned Common Shares or by attestation) and having a fair
market value (based on the closing sale price of the Common Shares of the Company as
reported on AMEX or, if the Common Shares are not traded on AMEX, &#147;fair market value&#148; as
defined in the Plan) on the exercise date equal to the amount required to be withheld; or

Options having a fair market value (based on the closing sale price of the Common Shares as
reported on AMEX or, if the Common Shares are not traded on AMEX, &#147;fair market value&#148; as
defined in the Plan) on the exercise date equal to the amount required to be withheld (but
only to the extent of the minimum amount required to be withheld to comply with applicable
state, federal and local income, wage and employment tax laws).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Adjustments upon Changes in the Common Shares</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;If, during the term of the Options, there is a dividend or split in respect of the Common
Shares, recapitalization (including, without limitation, the payment of an extraordinary dividend),
merger, consolidation, combination, spin-off, distribution of assets to shareholders, exchange of
shares, or other similar corporate change affecting the Common Shares, the Committee will
appropriately adjust the number of Common Shares subject to the Options as well as the Exercise
Price and any other factors, limits or terms affecting the Options.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)&nbsp;Notice of any adjustment made pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3 will be given by the Company to
the Optionee.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <U>Acceleration of Options upon &#147;Change in Control&#148;</U>. If a &#147;Change in Control&#148; (as
defined under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder) occurs, then the unexercised
portion of the Options (whether or not then exercisable by their terms) will become immediately
vested and exercisable in full and the Optionee will receive, upon payment of the Exercise Price,
securities or cash, or both, equal to those the Optionee

of the Optionee&#146;s immediate family (&#147;Permissible Transferees&#148;). Any Options transferred to a
Permissible Transferee will continue to be subject to all of the terms and conditions that applied
to the Options before the transfer and to any other rules prescribed by the Committee. A
Permissible Transferee may not retransfer the Options except by will or the laws of descent and

the consent of the Optionee, may cancel any portion of the Options by providing to the Optionee
written notice (a &#147;Buy Out Notice&#148;) of the Company&#146;s intention to exercise the right reserved in
this Section&nbsp;8. If a Buy Out Notice is given, the Company will pay to the Optionee, in respect of
each Common Share covered by the Options and subject to the Buy Out Notice, the difference between
(i)&nbsp;the fair market value of the Common Shares (based on the closing sale price of the Common
Shares as reported on AMEX or if the Common Shares are not traded on AMEX, &#147;fair market value&#148; as
defined in the Plan) on the date of the Buy Out Notice and (ii)&nbsp;the Exercise Price. In the
discretion of the Committee, such payment may be made with respect to not only that portion of the
Options which is vested and exercisable on the date of the Buy Out Notice but also that portion of
the Options which is not vested and exercisable on the date of the Buy Out Notice. The Company
will complete any buy out made under this Section&nbsp;8 as soon as administratively possible after the
date of the Buy Out Notice. At the Committee&#146;s option, payment of the buy out amount may be made
in cash, in whole Common Shares or partly in cash and partly in whole Common Shares. The number of
whole Common Shares, if any, included in the buy out amount will be determined by dividing the
amount of the payment to be made in Common Shares by the fair market value of the Common Shares
(based on the closing sale price of the Common Shares as reported on AMEX or if the Common Shares
are not traded on AMEX, &#147;fair market value&#148; as defined in the Plan) on the date of the Buy Out

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;28, 2007, the Board of Directors of AirNet, upon the recommendation of the Compensation
Committee, adopted the 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#147;2007 Incentive Plan&#148;). The purpose
of the 2007 Incentive Plan is to promote the following goals of
AirNet for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007 (the &#147;2007 fiscal year&#148;) by
providing incentive compensation to certain employees of AirNet:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Participants in the 2007 Incentive Plan include AirNet&#146;s executive officers &#150; Bruce D. Parker
(Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer), Gary W. Qualmann (Chief Financial Officer,
Treasurer and Secretary), Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. (Senior Vice President, Express Services),
Jeffery B. Harris (Senior Vice President, Bank Services), Ray L. Druseikis (Controller and
Principal Accounting Officer) and Craig A. Leach (Vice President, Information Systems), &#151; and certain department managers and department directors.
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were 37 participants in the 2007
Incentive Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The targeted incentive compensation payment a participant may earn under the 2007 Incentive Plan
ranges from 20% to 100% of the participant&#146;s base salary, depending upon such participant&#146;s level of
responsibility for achieving AirNet&#146;s goals for the 2007 fiscal year. The targeted percentage of
annual base salary that each of AirNet&#146;s executive officers may earn as incentive compensation
under the 2007 Incentive Plan is as follows: Bruce D. Parker, 100%; Gary W. Qualmann, Larry M.
Glasscock, Jr., and Jeffery B. Harris, 75%; Ray L. Druseikis and Craig A. Leach, 50%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Payments under the 2007 Incentive Plan will be based on a combination of AirNet&#146;s (i)&nbsp;pre-tax
income for the 2007 fiscal year, (ii)&nbsp;Express Services revenues and contribution margins for the
2007 fiscal year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal goals assigned to each participant. The
Compensation Committee determines the personal goals of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief
Executive Officer determines the personal goals for the other
executive officers, which are reviewed
and approved by the Compensation Committee. The personal goals of other participants are approved
by the Chief Executive Officer and are reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The personal goals
approved by the Compensation Committee for each of the executive officers relate to specific
business objectives related to general business operations (e.g., regulatory compliance, expense
reductions, etc.) and each business segment (e.g., execution of specific contracts with customers
and vendors, cost reductions, service improvements, etc.).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">With the
exception of Bruce D. Parker, no incentive compensation will be paid under the 2007 Incentive Plan unless AirNet achieves at
least 80% of its targeted pre-tax income for the 2007 fiscal year.
Mr. Parker will be eligible to receive the portion of his incentive
compensation potential allocated to his personal goals without regard
to AirNet&#146;s attainment of its financial objectives. Once this designated threshold
level of pre-tax income is achieved, potential incentive compensation payouts will increase at
predetermined levels until the maximum incentive compensation payout of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million
is reached at approximately 140% of AirNet&#146;s targeted pre-tax income for the 2007 fiscal year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Once the aggregate potential incentive compensation payout is determined based upon the level of
pre-tax income achieved by AirNet during the 2007 fiscal year, each participant&#146;s incentive
compensation payment will be determined based upon the following three components of the 2007
Incentive Compensation Plan (i)&nbsp;pre-tax income for the 2007 fiscal year; (ii)&nbsp;Express Services
revenues and contribution margins for the 2007 fiscal year, and (iii)&nbsp;the achievement of personal
goals. With the exception of Mr.&nbsp;Parker, 20% of each participant&#146;s incentive compensation payout
is allocated to the attainment of personal goals. Forty percent of Mr.&nbsp;Parker&#146;s incentive
compensation payment is allocated to the attainment of personal goals. The portion of each
participant&#146;s incentive compensation potential that is not allocated to the attainment of personal
goals will be allocated to the attainment of predetermined levels of pre-tax income and Express
Services revenues and contribution margin based upon such participant&#146;s responsibility for
achieving such goals.
