In addition, during challenging economic times, actions by our competitors to increase their revenues can have an adverse impact on our\\nrevenues. See “The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic” below. Certain labor agreements to which we are a party limit our ability to reduce the number of aircraft in operation, and the utilization of such aircraft,\\nbelow certain levels.

Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access\\nto petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price\\nvolatility and cost increases in the future.

Prior to the closing of the Merger, we sought to manage the risk of fuel price increases by using derivative contracts. During the\\nsecond quarter of 2014, we sold our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June\\xa030, 2014. We have not entered into any transactions to hedge our fuel consumption since December\\xa09, 2013 and,\\naccordingly, as of December\\xa031, 2014, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations\\nin fuel prices.

To the extent we use derivative contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if prices\\ndecline significantly, such derivative contracts may limit our ability to benefit from lower fuel costs in the future. Also, a rapid decline in the projected price of fuel at a time when we have fuel hedging contracts in place could adversely impact\\nour short-term liquidity, because hedge counterparties could require that we post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit.

In many of our markets we\\ncompete with at least one low-cost air carrier. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues,\\nbut on overall industry revenues. These factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses, as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may institute pricing structures intended to achieve\\nnear-term survival rather than long-term viability. ',\n",
       " 'Low-cost carriers have a profound impact on industry\\nrevenues. Using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from larger, more established airlines. Some low-cost carriers, which have cost structures lower than ours, have better recent financial\\nperformance and have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of aircraft for delivery in the next few years. These low-cost carriers are expected to continue to increase their market share through growth and,\\npotentially, consolidation, and could continue to have an impact on our overall performance. For example, as a result of divestitures completed in connection with gaining regulatory approval for the Merger, low-fare, low-cost carriers have gained\\nadditional access in a number of markets, including DCA, a Slot-controlled airport. In addition, the Wright Amendment Reform Act reduced, and has now eliminated all, domestic non-stop geographic restrictions on operations by Southwest Airlines and\\nother carriers at DAL. The two gates at DAL that we divested as part of our settlement of antitrust litigation related to the Merger have been allocated to Virgin America, a low-cost carrier. The changed operating rules at DAL and that divestiture\\nhave increased low-cost carrier competition for our hub at DFW. The actions of the low-cost carriers, including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. ',\n",

In addition, open skies\\nagreements with an increasing number of countries around the world provide international airlines with open access to U.S. markets. During 2014, international capacity grew more quickly than domestic service creating a very competitive operating\\nenvironment.

To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our\\nability to effectively compete may be hindered. Our ability to attract and retain customers is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to offer our customers convenient access to desired markets.

Depending on which carriers combine and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other carriers in connection with such combinations, our competitive position relative to the\\npost-combination carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. In addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or antitrust immunity grants, their route networks will grow, and that growth will result in greater\\noverlap with our network, which in turn could result in lower overall market share and revenues for us.

Subsequently, the EU has amended the EU ETS so that the monitoring, reporting and submission of allowances for aviation GHG emissions will continue to be limited to only intra-EEA flights through 2016, at\\nwhich time the EU will evaluate the progress made by ICAO and determine what, if any, measures to take related to aviation GHG emissions from 2017 onwards.

       "'Below are certain risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading\\nprice of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management\\ncannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business. Risk Factors Relating to the Company and Industry-Related Risks We could experience significant operating losses in the future. For a number of reasons, including those addressed in these risk factors, we might fail to maintain profitability and might experience significant losses. In particular, the condition of the economy, the\\nlevel and volatility of fuel prices, the state of travel demand and intense competition in the airline industry have had and will continue to have an impact on our operating results, and may increase the risk that we will experience losses.\\nDownturns in economic conditions adversely affect our business. Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending, airline industry revenues are heavily influenced\\nby the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel and changes in booking\\npractices, both of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our revenues. In addition, during challenging economic times, actions by our competitors to increase their revenues can have an adverse impact on our\\nrevenues. See “The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic” below. Certain labor agreements to which we are a party limit our ability to reduce the number of aircraft in operation, and the utilization of such aircraft,\\nbelow certain levels. As a result, we may not be able to optimize the number of aircraft in operation in response to a decrease in passenger demand for air travel. Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of\\naircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity. Our\\noperating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over\\nthe past several years and prices continued to be volatile in 2014. Because of the amount of fuel needed to\\noperate our business, even a relatively small increase in the price of fuel can have a material adverse aggregate effect on our operating results and liquidity. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the\\nmarket, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares, impose fuel surcharges or otherwise increase revenues sufficiently to offset fuel price increases. Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, we cannot predict the future availability,\\nprice volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access\\nto petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price\\nvolatility and cost increases in the future. We have a large number of older aircraft in our fleet, and these\\naircraft are not as fuel efficient as more recent models of aircraft, including those we have on order. We intend to continue to execute our fleet renewal plans to, \\xa030 \\n\\namong other things, improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet, and we are dependent on a limited number of major aircraft manufacturers to deliver aircraft on schedule. If we experience delays in\\ndelivery of the more fuel efficient aircraft that we have on order, we will be adversely affected. Our\\naviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide meaningful price protection against increases in fuel costs. Prior to the closing of the Merger, we sought to manage the risk of fuel price increases by using derivative contracts. During the\\nsecond quarter of 2014, we sold our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June\\xa030, 2014. We have not entered into any transactions to hedge our fuel consumption since December\\xa09, 2013 and,\\naccordingly, as of December\\xa031'"
